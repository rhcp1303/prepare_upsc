**1. With reference to the Jat and Sikh movements in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jat movement, primarily agrarian in nature, involved peasant cultivators and zamindars, and ultimately led to the establishment of independent regional states.
2.  The Sikh movement, significantly influenced by religious factors, culminated in the formation of independent regional states, distinct from the Mughal Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Jat and Sikh movements during the decline of the Mughal Empire.  The Jat movement, originating in the Agra-Delhi region, primarily comprised peasant cultivators with some zamindars. Their revolts, often stemming from land revenue disputes, were characterized by their strong sense of community and utilization of the difficult terrain to their advantage.  These revolts, though initially suppressed, eventually led to the establishment of independent Jat principalities in the 18th century, demonstrating the movement's success in achieving regional autonomy.

The Sikh movement, while also involving elements of agrarian unrest, was profoundly shaped by religious factors.  The religious revivalism and the unique socio-religious structure of Sikhism provided a powerful unifying force that mobilized followers against Mughal rule.  The movement's culmination was the establishment of independent Sikh states, marking a significant shift in the political landscape of Northwest India.  Therefore, both statements correctly capture the key characteristics and outcomes of these distinct yet interconnected movements.  Option (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially represent the historical reality. Option (d) is entirely incorrect as both movements resulted in the creation of independent regional states.


**2. With reference to the Afghan uprisings during Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Afghan uprisings were solely motivated by religious sentiments, specifically a reaction against Aurangzeb’s religious policies.
2.  The uprisings, led by figures like Bhagu and Akmal Khan, significantly disrupted Mughal control in the Northwest frontier regions and impacted Mughal strategies in the Deccan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is inaccurate. While religious factors played a role in some Afghan uprisings, such as the Raushanai movement’s emphasis on ethical life and devotion,  the uprisings were not solely driven by religious opposition to Aurangzeb's policies.  The conflicts had strong economic and political roots, stemming from the Afghans' precarious livelihood in the mountainous regions and their desire for regional autonomy. The ambition of establishing a separate Afghan state was a significant motivator.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the impact of the uprisings.  The revolts, led by figures like Bhagu (Yusufazai tribe) and Akmal Khan (Afridi leader), severely challenged Mughal authority in the Northwest frontier regions.  These uprisings caused significant disruptions in trade routes (like the Khyber Pass) and military operations.  Importantly, the diversion of Mughal resources and attention to suppressing these uprisings inadvertently eased the pressure on Shivaji in the Deccan, allowing him to consolidate his power and forge alliances. Therefore, statement 2 accurately depicts the political and strategic consequences of the Afghan uprisings. Option (a) is incorrect because it oversimplifies the complex causes of the uprisings. Option (c) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is a factually correct representation of the historical events.


**3. With reference to the economic and social conditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers consistently reported widespread affluence and prosperity among the common people (peasants, artisans, and laborers) during the Mughal period.
2.  The standard of living for the majority of the population was largely determined by income and wages, with significant inequalities existing between landowners, artisans, and landless laborers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While European accounts often highlighted the wealth and opulence of the ruling classes, they also consistently documented the widespread poverty and hardship experienced by the vast majority of the population—peasants, artisans, and laborers.  Travelers like Babur and Ralph Fitch noted the meager clothing and limited possessions of ordinary people, indicating a stark contrast between the lifestyles of the elite and the masses.  The accounts consistently describe a situation of grinding poverty for the commoners.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the economic realities of medieval India. The standard of living was heavily influenced by income and wages, with significant disparities. Landowners (zamindars, khudkashts) generally enjoyed a higher standard of living than artisans and landless laborers. The landless and lower-caste individuals faced the most severe hardships, particularly during famines, which were frequent occurrences.  The system of customary payments and barter in villages further complicated the assessment of income and wages, highlighting the complexity of economic stratification. Option (a) is incorrect because it misrepresents the accounts of European travelers. Option (c) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1. Option (d) is incorrect as statement 2 correctly describes the existing economic and social inequalities.


**4. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and its interactions with neighboring powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's reign witnessed the Vijayanagara Empire's undisputed military dominance over the entire Indian subcontinent, extending its influence to countries like Pegu and Tenasserim.
2.  The Bahmani kingdom, particularly under Firuz Shah Bahmani, significantly expanded its territory, challenging Vijayanagara's dominance and engaging in a prolonged struggle for control of the Krishna-Godavari basin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an exaggeration. While Deva Raya II's reign saw Vijayanagara at its zenith in the south, it did not represent undisputed military dominance over the entire Indian subcontinent. The claim of tribute from Pegu and Tenasserim is questionable; it likely refers to diplomatic exchanges and gifts rather than enforced tribute. Vijayanagara's power was primarily concentrated in South India, and its influence beyond that region was limited.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Bahmani kingdom's expansion and conflict with Vijayanagara. Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign was a period of significant territorial expansion for the Bahmani kingdom, leading to increased competition with Vijayanagara for dominance in the Deccan.  The struggle for control over the Krishna-Godavari basin was a major point of contention, marked by several battles and shifting power dynamics. Option (a) is incorrect because it overstates Vijayanagara's influence. Option (c) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statement 1. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 accurately reflects the historical context of the Bahmani-Vijayanagara conflict.


**5. With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate's administrative structure was characterized by a highly centralized system with minimal autonomy granted to provincial or local units.
2.  The village, as the basic unit of administration, functioned with relative autonomy, largely undisturbed as long as land revenue obligations were met.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification. While the Delhi Sultanate aimed for centralized control, the degree of centralization varied across different periods and rulers.  Provincial and local units enjoyed varying degrees of autonomy, particularly during periods of weak central authority. The administrative structure was more complex than a purely centralized system, with significant power residing at the provincial and local levels, especially in the initial stages of the Sultanate.

Statement 2 accurately describes the functioning of the village administration.  The village, as the basic administrative unit, operated with a degree of autonomy, largely left undisturbed as long as the land revenue was paid. The village headman (muqaddam) and village accountant (patwari) played crucial roles in local administration, and the system largely followed pre-existing practices.  Intervention by the central government was often limited, unless serious issues arose. Option (a) is incorrect because it presents a simplistic view of the Sultanate’s administration. Option (c) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 correctly describes the relative autonomy of village administration.


**6. With reference to the Bhakti movement in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement was exclusively a Hindu phenomenon, with no interaction or influence from Sufi traditions.
2.  Kabir and Nanak, while critical of existing social structures, primarily focused on individual spiritual reform rather than large-scale social change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement had significant interactions and shared common ground with Sufi traditions.  Both movements emphasized devotion (bhakti/Ishq), challenged traditional religious hierarchies, and promoted a more inclusive and less caste-ridden society.  The exchange of ideas and mutual influence between Bhakti saints and Sufi saints are well documented, especially in the works of Kabir, who drew inspiration from both Hindu and Islamic traditions.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the primary focus of Kabir and Nanak. While both were critical of the prevailing social order, particularly the caste system and religious dogmatism, their main emphasis was on individual spiritual transformation.  Their teachings aimed at reforming the individual's consciousness and relationship with the divine, rather than directly advocating for large-scale social reforms.  Although their ideas had indirect societal impact, their primary goal was individual spiritual liberation. Option (a) is incorrect due to the significant interaction between Bhakti and Sufi traditions. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is factually incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 accurately captures the central theme of Kabir and Nanak's teachings.


**7. With reference to the cultural developments during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The use of Sanskrit declined significantly during the medieval period, replaced entirely by Persian as the dominant language of administration and literature.
2.  Regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi flourished during the medieval period, gaining prominence as mediums for literary works and administrative purposes in various regional kingdoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is inaccurate. While Persian gained prominence as the language of administration under the Delhi Sultanate and in many other Muslim kingdoms, Sanskrit did not disappear. It continued to be used in various parts of India for higher learning, religious texts, and literature, especially in regions where Hindu rulers maintained power.  The claim of complete replacement is incorrect.  Sanskrit retained its importance, particularly in religious and scholarly spheres.

Statement 2 correctly describes the flourishing of regional languages.  Many regional languages, including Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi, experienced significant growth and development during the medieval period.  The Bhakti movement played a crucial role in popularizing these languages as mediums for religious literature, and they gradually gained importance in administrative contexts, especially in regional kingdoms that emerged after the decline of the Delhi Sultanate.  Option (a) is incorrect due to the continued use of Sanskrit. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is inaccurate. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 correctly reflects the rise of regional languages.


**8. With reference to the military organization of the early medieval empires in India (e.g., Pratiharas, Rashtrakutas, Palas), consider the following statements:**

1.  The armies of these empires relied solely on infantry, with cavalry and naval forces playing a negligible role in their military strategies.
2.  The empires consisted of directly administered territories and areas ruled by vassal chiefs, who were autonomous in internal affairs but obligated to pay tribute and provide troops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The armies of the early medieval empires in India did not rely solely on infantry.  Cavalry played a significant role, particularly in the Pratihara kingdom which is known for its superior cavalry.  Some empires, like the Palas and Rashtrakutas, also maintained naval forces, though the extent and organization of these navies are not fully documented. The statement's assertion of a negligible role for cavalry and naval forces is therefore inaccurate.

Statement 2 accurately depicts the political organization of these empires.  The empires comprised a mix of directly administered territories and regions ruled by vassal chiefs. These vassal chiefs enjoyed a degree of autonomy in their internal affairs but were obligated to pay tribute and provide troops to the overlord.  This system, characterized by a combination of direct rule and decentralized control through vassalage, was a common feature of the early medieval period in India. Option (a) is incorrect because of the significant role of cavalry and, in some cases, naval forces. Option (c) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 correctly describes the political organization of the early medieval empires.


**9.  With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola Empire's expansion was solely driven by the ambition of conquering neighboring kingdoms and establishing territorial dominance.
2.  The Chola navy played a crucial role in the empire's expansion, facilitating conquests in Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and influencing trade relations with Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification. While territorial expansion was a key aspect of the Chola Empire's growth, it was not the sole driving force.  Control over trade routes, particularly those connecting India with Southeast Asia, was also a significant motivator for Chola expansion.  The control of these sea trade routes and ports gave the Chola empire a major economic advantage and strategic position.  Their naval power was essential to protecting and expanding trade.

Statement 2 accurately highlights the crucial role of the Chola navy.  The Chola navy was a powerful force that enabled the empire's expansion beyond the mainland. Their naval dominance allowed them to conquer Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while also projecting their influence and controlling trade in the Indian Ocean region and establishing trade relations with Southeast Asian countries. Option (a) is incorrect because it ignores the economic motivations for Chola expansion. Option (c) is incorrect due to the oversimplification in statement 1. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 correctly reflects the importance of the Chola navy in their expansion and control over trade.


**10. With reference to the economic life during the reign of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate period witnessed a decline in trade and commerce, leading to a contraction of urban centers and a decrease in the overall standard of living.
2.  The introduction of new crafts and technologies, along with improvements in agriculture and communication, contributed to a period of economic growth and relative affluence during parts of the Sultanate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Delhi Sultanate period, while marked by periods of instability and conflict, also witnessed significant growth in trade and commerce.  The establishment of a sound currency system, improvements in communication networks (roads, postal relays), and the expansion of urban centers indicate a flourishing urban economy.  The statement's assertion of a decline in trade and commerce is therefore inaccurate.

Statement 2 correctly points to the factors that contributed to periods of economic growth.  The introduction of new crafts (paper-making, improved looms, spinning wheels), technologies (improved rahat for irrigation), and advancements in agriculture contributed to increased production and trade.  This led to periods of relative affluence during parts of the Sultanate, particularly under rulers who promoted economic development. Option (a) is incorrect due to the growth of trade and urban centers during the Sultanate. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is inaccurate. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 accurately reflects the factors that contributed to economic growth during parts of the Delhi Sultanate.


**1. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline in the prestige of Brahmins and Sanskrit contributed significantly to the rise of regional languages for literary purposes.
2.  The Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on vernacular languages, played a crucial role in the maturation of regional languages and their use in literary works, particularly in the pre-Turkish period.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The diminishing prestige of Sanskrit, partly due to the decline in Brahmanical influence, created a space for regional languages to flourish.  The adoption of vernacular languages by Bhakti saints further accelerated this process.  The shift away from Sanskrit as the sole language of religious and literary expression opened the doors for the development and standardization of regional languages.  This was a gradual process, influenced by various socio-political factors, but the decline of Sanskrit's dominance was a key catalyst.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement undeniably played a significant role in popularizing regional languages, its primary impact was felt *after* the pre-Turkish period.  The pre-Turkish era saw the use of regional languages in administration in some kingdoms, but the widespread literary adoption of these languages was a later phenomenon largely fueled by the Bhakti movement's embrace of vernacular expression.  The Bhakti saints certainly accelerated the process, but the initial groundwork for the use of regional languages was laid earlier, in the pre-Turkish period, due to other factors such as regional administrative needs and the changing socio-political landscape.


**2. With reference to the impact of the Turkish conquest on Indian music, consider the following statements:**

1.  The arrival of the Turks introduced new musical instruments like the rabab and sarangi, and new musical modes (ragas) such as aiman, ghora, and sanam, significantly altering the existing musical landscape.
2.  The integration of Perso-Arabic musical elements into Indian classical music was primarily confined to the courts of the Delhi Sultanate and did not have a lasting impact on regional musical traditions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Turkish conquest brought about a significant exchange of musical traditions.  The introduction of new instruments and ragas from Perso-Arabic sources enriched Indian music, leading to a fusion of styles and a diversification of the musical repertoire.  This interaction was a crucial phase in the evolution of Indian classical music, demonstrating the dynamism and adaptability of musical forms across cultures.  The impact was not limited to courtly music but also influenced regional traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The influence of Perso-Arabic musical elements extended beyond the Delhi Sultanate's courts.  While the courts were important centers for the patronage and development of this fusion, the impact spread to various regional kingdoms and musical traditions.  The incorporation of new instruments, ragas, and musical scales had a lasting influence on the development of Hindustani classical music, shaping its structure and character. The process of integration continued even after the decline of the Sultanate.


**3. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, challenged the caste system and rejected traditional Hindu practices like pilgrimages and sacrifices, promoting social equality.
2. The Bhakti movement, while advocating devotion and love for God, largely remained within the framework of Hinduism and did not actively challenge the caste system, despite some saints belonging to lower castes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lingayat movement, a significant socio-religious reform movement, directly challenged the rigidity of the caste system and advocated for social equality.  Its rejection of traditional Hindu rituals and its emphasis on the worship of Shiva in a simplified, egalitarian manner marked a distinct departure from orthodox Hinduism.  The movement's impact was profound, particularly in Karnataka, where it continues to thrive.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Bhakti movement, while promoting a more personal and emotional form of devotion open to all castes, generally operated within the broader framework of Hinduism.  Although many Bhakti saints came from lower castes and challenged some aspects of social hierarchy through their teachings and actions, they did not systematically dismantle the caste system.  The movement's emphasis on bhakti (devotion) and its accessibility to all castes ultimately strengthened Hinduism's appeal to a wider population, but did not necessarily erase existing social inequalities.


**4. With reference to the political landscape of North India during the 12th and 13th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1.  The defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan at the Second Battle of Tarain marked the beginning of the widespread establishment of Turkish rule in North India, paving the way for the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The Ghurid conquests were solely motivated by a desire for territorial expansion and plunder, with little regard for the existing socio-political structures of the conquered regions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Second Battle of Tarain (1192 CE) is widely considered a watershed moment in Indian history, signifying the beginning of the sustained Turkish presence and the eventual establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.  Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat marked a significant turning point, allowing the Ghurids to consolidate their power in the region and lay the foundation for their subsequent expansion.  This event represents a major shift in the political power dynamics of North India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While plunder and territorial expansion were undoubtedly significant factors in the Ghurid conquests, their motivations were more complex.  The Ghurids, though initially driven by the ambition for power and wealth, did adapt to the existing socio-political structures of the conquered regions to an extent.  Their administration, while often harsh, was not entirely devoid of attempts at integration and the utilization of existing systems.  To characterize their actions solely as driven by plunder overlooks the nuanced complexities of their governance.


**5. With reference to the economic and social conditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of long-distance trade within India during the medieval period led to a decline in the importance of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs), which often comprised members from different castes.
2.  The medieval period witnessed a significant deterioration in the living standards of the majority of the population, including peasants, artisans, and laborers, despite the wealth and prosperity enjoyed by the ruling class.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The shift towards a more localized economy in medieval India, resulting from the decline of extensive long-distance trade, impacted the role and significance of trade guilds.  These guilds, which had earlier played a crucial role in commerce and often transcended caste boundaries, lost their prominence as the nature of trade changed.  Their functions were gradually absorbed by other social and economic structures.

Statement 2 is also correct. Accounts from European travelers and historical records suggest a stark contrast between the opulence of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty among the common people.  While the ruling elites enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle, the majority of the population, especially peasants, artisans, and laborers, faced difficult living conditions characterized by inadequate clothing, housing, and food security. This disparity highlights the significant social and economic inequalities prevalent in medieval India.


**1. With reference to the Deccan region during the reign of Shah Jahan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The treaty of 1636 with Bijapur stipulated that the Adil Shah would cede territory worth approximately 20 lakh huns annually to the Mughals in return for Mughal protection.
2.  The treaty with Golconda in 1636 mandated that the Qutb Shah would include Shah Jahan's name in the khutba and remit the annual tribute previously paid to Bijapur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The treaty of 1636 with Bijapur did not involve the Adil Shah ceding territory worth 20 lakh huns annually to the *Mughals*. Instead, Bijapur ceded territory worth that amount *to Bijapur itself*, as a reward for recognizing Mughal suzerainty and other concessions.  The treaty aimed at securing Bijapur's cooperation and preventing further conflict, not extracting direct territorial gains for the Mughals at that point. The  Mughal acquisition of territory was indirect, through Bijapur's expansion southwards, facilitated by the treaty.


Statement 2 is correct.  The 1636 treaty with Golconda explicitly required the Qutb Shah to include Shah Jahan's name in the khutba, a formal prayer for the ruler, thereby acknowledging Mughal supremacy.  Furthermore, the treaty resulted in the remission of the tribute Golconda previously paid to Bijapur. This tribute was not entirely eliminated;  a reduced tribute was instead paid to the Mughal emperor. This demonstrates Shah Jahan’s successful assertion of Mughal authority and control over tributary relationships in the Deccan.  The change in tribute recipient reflected the shift in regional power dynamics, with the Mughals superseding Bijapur as the dominant power.



**2. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ali Adil Shah II (1580-1627) of Bijapur is known for composing the "Kitab-i-Nawras," a collection of songs set to various ragas, and for his patronage of Hindu saints and temples, including Pandharpur.
2.  Ibrahim Adil Shah I (d. 1580) of Bijapur is remembered for his tolerance, hosting discussions with Hindu and Muslim saints and inviting Catholic missionaries to his court before Akbar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text clearly attributes the composition of "Kitab-i-Nawras" and the patronage of Hindu saints and temples, including Pandharpur, to Ibrahim Adil Shah II. His inclusive approach, encompassing both musical and religious patronage, highlights the cultural synthesis within the Bijapur kingdom. The mention of Pandharpur, a significant center of the Bhakti movement, underscores the reach of his patronage beyond the immediate court and into wider religious spheres.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The description of the ruler who loved to hold discussions with Hindu and Muslim saints, invited Catholic missionaries before Akbar, and appointed the Sanskrit scholar Waman Pandit is attributed to Ali Adil Shah I, not Ibrahim Adil Shah I.  This highlights the importance of careful attention to detail when dealing with historical figures and their achievements. Confusing the two rulers demonstrates a common error in understanding the chronology and details of Deccan history.  The accuracy of associating specific actions with the correct ruler is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the Deccan's cultural landscape.



**3. With reference to the political and administrative developments during the first half of the seventeenth century in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal emperors Jahangir and Shah Jahan consolidated Akbar's administrative system, maintained alliances with Rajputs, and broadened the empire's political base by forging alliances with Afghans and Marathas.
2.  The Deccan states of Bijapur and Golconda, after signing treaties with the Mughals in 1636, experienced rapid territorial expansion southward, conquering Karnataka and beyond.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage explicitly states that Jahangir and Shah Jahan followed Akbar's administrative model, preserved Rajput alliances (emphasizing continuity and stability), and expanded their political influence by allying with Afghans and Marathas (demonstrating strategic flexibility and inclusivity). This showcases the consistent elements of Mughal rule alongside its adaptive strategies.  The mention of specific groups like Afghans and Marathas emphasizes the diverse nature of Mughal alliances and their importance in consolidating power.


Statement 2 is also correct. The passage directly describes the post-1636 expansion of Bijapur and Golconda into Karnataka, extending their control significantly southward.  This expansion, facilitated by peace with the Mughals, illustrates the impact of Mughal policy on regional power dynamics. The description of the expansion's geographical reach and the details of the division of spoils between Bijapur and Golconda further highlight the scope and consequences of this period's events. The eventual internal weaknesses arising from this rapid expansion are also noted, providing a balanced perspective on the period's significance.



**4. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah of Bengal (1493-1519), consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule is considered a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, with many renowned Bengali writers flourishing during his reign.  His wazir was a Hindu.
2.  Alauddin Hussain Shah successfully conquered the Ahom kingdom in Assam, annexing it to Bengal and appointing one of his sons as governor of the newly acquired territory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly identifies Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign as a golden age for Bengali literature. The flourishing of Bengali writers under his rule, coupled with his appointment of a Hindu wazir, indicates a period of relative religious tolerance and cultural advancement. The mention of the wazir's religious background further emphasizes the inclusive nature of his administration.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Alauddin Hussain Shah did conquer Kamata (Kamrup) in modern-day Cooch Bihar, he did not conquer the Ahom kingdom in eastern Assam.  The text explicitly states that a subsequent attack on the Ahom kingdom by his son was unsuccessful, highlighting the limits of his territorial expansion in that region.  Confusing Kamata with the Ahom kingdom demonstrates a common misunderstanding of the geography and political landscape of northeastern India during this period. The unsuccessful campaign against the Ahoms showcases the resilience of the Ahom kingdom and the challenges faced by Bengal in extending its control eastward.


**5.  With reference to the architectural styles of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur, built in 1660, is renowned for its harmonious proportions, large dome, and remarkable acoustics, allowing whispers to be heard across the main room.
2.  The Charminar in Hyderabad, completed in 1591-92, features four lofty arches facing the four cardinal directions and four four-storied minarets, showcasing the architectural achievements of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage accurately describes the Gol Gumbaz's architectural features: its large dome (the largest single dome ever constructed), harmonious proportions, and unique acoustic properties. These aspects are hallmarks of Bijapuri architecture and its sophisticated engineering.  The mention of the acoustics adds a detail that distinguishes this structure from other large domes.


Statement 2 is also correct. The description of the Charminar's design—four arches, four minarets, and its location in Hyderabad—matches the information provided in the text. The attribution to Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah correctly identifies the ruler responsible for commissioning this iconic structure.  The architectural details given accurately reflect the Charminar's distinctive style and its importance in Hyderabad's cityscape.  The precision in the description of both structures demonstrates a good understanding of Deccan architecture.

**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's reign witnessed tributary relationships with kingdoms as far as Pegu and Tenasserim, indicating a powerful Vijayanagara navy capable of controlling extensive sea routes.
2.  The accounts of Nicolo Conti and Abdur Razzaq, while praising Vijayanagara's wealth and size, provide conflicting details regarding the city's fortifications and military strength.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Deva Raya II's reign saw contact with Pegu and Tenasserim,  the text itself casts doubt on the assertion of regular tribute extraction and a powerful navy capable of enforcing this across such vast distances. The description suggests diplomatic relations and exchange of gifts were more likely than consistent tribute collection, which necessitates naval dominance.  The text only mentions Sri Lanka being invaded multiple times, implying some naval capacity, but not dominance over the entire Indian Ocean region.

Statement 2 is correct.  Nicolo Conti and Abdur Razzaq both describe Vijayanagara's magnificence and power. However, their accounts differ. Conti emphasizes the vast size of the city (60 miles circumference) and a large army (90,000 men), while Abdur Razzaq focuses on the city's elaborate fortifications (seven citadels and walls) and vast territory ("three months journey"). These differences highlight the difficulty of obtaining completely accurate and consistent information from contemporary accounts.  Discrepancies in the descriptions of the city and its military strength reveal the limitations of relying solely on traveler's accounts for precise historical information.  Multiple sources are needed for a complete understanding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign witnessed a rise in the influence of Deccani Brahmins, especially in revenue administration. This was a deliberate policy to balance the influx of foreigners and foster a more inclusive administration.  This reflects a nuanced approach to governance, incorporating elements of the existing social structure. This demonstrates a pragmatic approach to ruling a diverse population.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Firuz Shah Bahmani did focus on Chaul and Dabhol, the text does not attribute a decline in Vijayanagara's overseas trade directly to this.  The text primarily focuses on the Bahmani kingdom's expansion and its impact on the balance of power in the Deccan. There is no explicit mention of a significant decline in Vijayanagara's trade due to Bahmani's port development. To definitively conclude a causal relationship between Bahmani port development and Vijayanagara's trade requires more evidence.  The text focuses on the political and territorial aspects of Firuz Shah's reign.


**3. With reference to Mahmud Gawan's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  His military campaigns resulted in the annexation of significant territories in the east, reaching as far as Kanchi, and the control of crucial western coastal ports like Dabhol and Goa, severely impacting Vijayanagara's power.

Furthermore, his control over Dabhol and Goa dealt a heavy blow to Vijayanagara's maritime trade and overall power. This showcases his strategic military acumen and its direct impact on the political landscape of the Deccan.  The capture of these ports significantly altered the regional power balance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms are detailed in the text. He implemented a system where nobles' salaries were fixed, payable either in cash or through jagirs, a system that aimed for greater efficiency and control over revenue collection. This reform aimed at streamlining the administration and strengthening the central authority.  The specific details of the salary structure (1,00,000 Azns for 500 horses) and the allocation of *khalisa* lands for the sultan's expenses illustrate the meticulous nature of his reforms.


**4. With reference to the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

This internal strife paved the way for the rise of powerful ministers who exploited the weakened central authority, exacerbating the empire's decline.  The description of ministers extorting heavy taxes and the eventual usurpation of the throne by Saluva, a minister, illustrates this process.  This highlights the fragility of empires during periods of succession crises.

Statement 2 is also correct. Krishna Deva Raya, despite his military successes, is criticized for neglecting naval development, a weakness that left the empire vulnerable to the growing influence of the Portuguese. This oversight is presented as a significant factor contributing to the long-term vulnerability of the empire. The text points out that unlike earlier Vijayanagara rulers, Krishna Deva Raya did not focus on naval power, highlighting a crucial strategic error in the face of emerging European maritime might. This omission demonstrates a failure to adapt to changing geopolitical dynamics.


**5. With reference to Firuz Shah Tughlaq's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  While maintaining a facade of religious tolerance, he implemented policies that targeted certain Muslim sects deemed heretical by orthodox theologians and enforced strict interpretations of Islamic law, including the jizya tax on Brahmins.
2.  Despite his orthodox religious views, he initiated the translation of Hindu religious texts into Persian, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to understanding the diverse population of his empire and undertaking humanitarian measures for the poor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

This highlights the tension between religious orthodoxy and pragmatic governance.  His actions reveal a complex approach to religious policy, balancing adherence to orthodox Islam with the practicalities of ruling a diverse empire.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Despite his orthodox leanings, Firuz Shah Tughlaq commissioned the translation of Hindu religious texts into Persian, indicating an effort to understand the beliefs and practices of his Hindu subjects.  His humanitarian initiatives, such as establishing hospitals for the poor and providing dowries, further reveal a pragmatic approach that went beyond mere religious considerations. This showcases a more nuanced understanding of his governance than simply labelling him as religiously orthodox. The translation initiative demonstrates an attempt at cultural exchange and understanding, while the humanitarian measures indicate a concern for the welfare of his subjects irrespective of religious affiliation.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of social and economic life in medieval South India as described in the provided text. Statement 1 correctly highlights the contrast between the kings' simple daily attire and their opulent adornment during official ceremonies, using accounts from foreign travelers like Chau Ju Kua and Marco Polo to support the claim. This showcases the importance of symbolic display of power and wealth in the context of royal authority.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that there was *no* idea of mass education in medieval India. Learning was largely confined to those who needed it for their livelihood, primarily Brahmins and sections of the upper classes. Statement 2 accurately describes a facet of the higher education system.  The text details how some temples offered advanced education, often requiring students to reside with their teachers or provide payment, which sometimes included personal service, especially for poorer students. This highlights the personalized and often reciprocal nature of the guru-shishya relationship within the educational framework of the time.


**3. With reference to scientific advancements and religious beliefs in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of surgery was attributed to the association of body dissection with lower castes, while astrology overshadowed astronomy.
2.  The Nath-Panthis, followers of Gorakhnath, embraced a caste-based system, upholding Brahmanical privileges.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies two aspects of the stagnation of science during the period. The text explains that the decline in surgery resulted from the societal stigma associated with body dissection, relegating it to lower castes.  It further notes the rise of astrology at the expense of astronomy. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Nath-Panthis, a group associated with Gorakhnath, are explicitly mentioned in the text as *denouncing* the caste system and challenging Brahmanical privileges. Their tantric path was open to all, regardless of caste.  This highlights a significant counter-narrative within the religious landscape of the time.


**4. With reference to the religious movements and beliefs during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pandya king in Madurai, influenced by a Saivite preacher, executed numerous Jain monks and seized their temples.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a historical event detailed in the text.  The persecution of Jains under the Pandya king in Madurai, instigated by a Saivite preacher, is described, demonstrating religious conflict and the suppression of one faith in favor of another. Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the Pala rulers were *patrons* of Buddhism, and it was their decline after the 10th century that significantly impacted Buddhism in the region. The decline was also attributed to internal developments within Buddhism itself, not direct suppression by the Pala rulers. This indicates a more nuanced understanding of the factors contributing to the decline of Buddhism.


**5.  With reference to the economic and social life during the Tughlaq period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sultan and nobles enjoyed a lavish lifestyle comparable to the ruling classes in the Islamic world, marked by opulent palaces, costly attire, and extravagant feasts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately depict contrasting aspects of economic and social life during the Tughlaq period. Statement 1 correctly portrays the extravagant lifestyle of the Sultan and nobility, comparing their standard of living to that of the wealthiest in the contemporary Islamic world. This illustrates the vast wealth concentrated within the ruling elite and their patronage of arts and crafts.

While he ostensibly followed the sharia's guidelines regarding existing temples, his actions and pronouncements often led to their destruction, particularly during times of conflict. This reflects the complex interplay between religious policy, political expediency, and personal biases. Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the re-imposition of jizya was not primarily an economic measure. While it did generate revenue, it served more significant political and ideological purposes, including rallying Muslim support and reinforcing the supremacy of Islam.  The allocation of funds to the theological class further underlines the ideological aspect.

Their mutual antagonism prevented them from effectively addressing larger political challenges. Statement 2 accurately reflects Mahmud Begarha's reign. He significantly expanded the Gujarat kingdom through military conquests of strategically important forts like Girnar and Champaner.  The text details his military strategies and administrative consolidation, showcasing his capabilities as a ruler.  The description of the Jauhar ceremony at Champaner further underscores the intensity of the conflict.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the text mentions Sikandar Lodi's re-imposition of jizya and the execution of a Brahmin, it also highlights his significant patronage of Hindu scholars and his promotion of cultural exchange. This suggests a more complex reality than simple suppression of Hindu culture. Statement 2 accurately reflects a significant aspect of Sikandar Lodi’s reign. He actively promoted cultural exchange and understanding between Hindus and Muslims, showcasing his patronage of scholars and translators, and encouraging the learning of Persian.  The translation of Sanskrit works into Persian further illustrates this policy.  This demonstrates the possibilities of cultural synthesis during a period marked by political and religious tensions.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text directly attributes the weakening of the Pratihara Empire, in part, to the loss of Gujarat to the Rashtrakutas.  The loss of this major trade center severely impacted the Pratihara's economic resources and their ability to maintain their power. The statement correctly reflects this historical development.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage describes Govinda III's extensive military campaigns, which expanded Rashtrakuta power and influence significantly in southern India.

It also notes that the village administration largely continued its existing structure, relying on the muqaddam and chaudhuris.  This demonstrates a pragmatic approach to integrating existing systems into the Sultanate's administration.  The statement accurately reflects this aspect of the administrative system.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage describes the muqti system, where revenue balances were remitted to the central authority. It explicitly mentions that the auditing process sometimes involved harsh measures, including torture and imprisonment of muqtis.  This highlights a potentially brutal aspect of the revenue collection system. The statement accurately reflects this aspect of the muqti system.

1.  The war of succession during Shah Jahan's later years was influenced by the lack of a clear tradition of succession, both within Muslim and Timurid traditions, leading to conflict among his sons.
2. Aurangzeb's victory in the war of succession was partly due to Dara Shikoh's strategic miscalculations, such as diverting key troops to the eastern campaign against Shuja, leaving Agra vulnerable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Mughal war of succession lacked clear established traditions, both within the Muslim and Timurid systems. This ambiguity contributed to the conflict among Shah Jahan's sons, highlighting the inherent instability in the absence of a defined succession process. The statement accurately reflects this historical context.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage points to Dara Shikoh's strategic errors as a contributing factor to Aurangzeb's success.  Dara's decision to deploy significant forces to the east against Shuja left Agra vulnerable, a critical miscalculation that allowed Aurangzeb to gain an advantage.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect historical facts regarding the patronage of Jainism and the resulting architectural achievements.  The Chalukyas of Gujarat were indeed known for their significant support of Jainism, and the Dilwara Temple at Mount Abu stands as a testament to their patronage. This temple complex is renowned for its intricate marble carvings and architectural grandeur, showcasing the high point of Jain artistry during that period.  Similarly, the Paramara dynasty of Malwa also actively supported Jainism. Their patronage resulted in the creation of numerous large-scale sculptures depicting Jain Tirthankaras and Mahavira, who gradually transitioned into a figure of worship within the Jain faith. These colossal statues represent a significant aspect of Jain religious art and the religious landscape of Malwa. Therefore, both statements are historically accurate and reflect the significant role played by these dynasties in the flourishing of Jainism and its art.


**2. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its social impact, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Shiva and Vishnu, utilizing Tamil as a medium to reach wider audiences.
2.  The Bhakti movement, spearheaded by the Nayanmars and Alvars, actively challenged and dismantled the caste system in South India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhakti movement in South India prominently featured the worship of Shiva and Vishnu.  The saints of the Bhakti movement, including the Nayanmars (devotees of Shiva) and the Alvars (devotees of Vishnu), effectively utilized the widely understood Tamil language to spread their message of devotion and love for God. This linguistic accessibility played a crucial role in the movement's widespread appeal and success in reaching diverse communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement emphasized a more egalitarian approach to faith, openly welcoming devotees from all castes, it didn't actively dismantle the caste system.  The Bhakti saints, though often originating from lower castes themselves, did not directly challenge the hierarchical structure of the caste system. Instead, they offered a path to salvation accessible to all, irrespective of caste, fostering a more inclusive religious experience within the existing societal framework.  The movement's impact was more about inclusivity within the framework of Hinduism rather than a complete overthrow of the caste system.


**3. With reference to the religious and political landscape of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lingayat or Virashaiva movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, vehemently opposed the caste system and advocated for social reforms such as allowing widow remarriage.
2.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy posed a significant intellectual challenge to Buddhism and Jainism, leading to their decline in certain regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate reflections of significant religious and social movements in medieval India.  The Lingayat movement, established by Basava and his nephew Channabasava in Karnataka, was indeed a powerful force for social reform.  It directly challenged the rigid caste system prevalent in society, advocating for a more egalitarian society.  The Lingayats rejected traditional Hindu practices like fasting, pilgrimages, and sacrifices, and importantly, they permitted widow remarriage, a significant step towards empowering women. Their emphasis on social equality and reform made them a distinct and influential sect within the broader religious landscape.


Statement 2 is also accurate.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy, with its emphasis on non-dualism (Advaita) and the unity of Brahman (ultimate reality) and Atman (individual self), posed a potent intellectual challenge to the philosophical underpinnings of Buddhism and Jainism.  While not directly leading to the violent suppression of these faiths, Sankara's influential philosophical system provided a powerful counter-narrative, contributing to the relative decline of Buddhism and Jainism in several parts of India.  His articulation of a comprehensive and systematic Hindu philosophy provided a strong intellectual framework that many found more compelling than the doctrines of Buddhism and Jainism.


**4. With reference to the economic and social life during the period of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed a flourishing urban economy, with cities like Delhi and Daulatabad emerging as significant centers of trade and commerce.
2.  Despite the growth of trade, the majority of the population, particularly peasants, continued to live in conditions of subsistence, facing hardships due to recurring famines and wars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements provide a balanced and accurate picture of the economic and social realities during the Delhi Sultanate.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the growth of urban centers and a flourishing urban economy.  The establishment of a sound currency system, improved communication networks, and increased trade led to the growth of major cities like Delhi and Daulatabad.  These cities became significant hubs for commerce, attracting merchants and artisans from various parts of the country and beyond. This economic growth is evidenced by accounts from travelers like Ibn Battuta, who described the scale and diversity of economic activity in these cities.

Statement 2 is also accurate. While urban centers experienced economic growth, the vast majority of the population, namely the peasantry, remained largely in conditions of subsistence.  Famines and wars were recurrent occurrences, exacerbating the hardships faced by the rural population.  The economic benefits of the flourishing urban economy did not reach the majority of the population, leading to a significant disparity between the urban elite and the rural masses. This highlights the unequal distribution of wealth and resources characteristic of the period.  Therefore, both statements correctly reflect the contrasting realities of the Delhi Sultanate’s economic and social landscape.


**5.  With reference to the Mughal nobility and its composition, consider the following statements:**

1. Under Akbar, Hindus constituted a significant portion of the Mughal nobility, with Rajputs forming the largest group, although their overall percentage remained relatively low.
2.  The Mughal nobility, while exhibiting diversity in terms of ethnic and religious backgrounds, largely maintained its aristocratic character, with hereditary titles and positions playing a significant role.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of the Mughal nobility. Statement 1 correctly points out the inclusion of Hindus, particularly Rajputs, within the Mughal nobility under Akbar's reign.  While Rajputs formed the most significant Hindu group within the nobility, their overall percentage compared to other groups remained relatively modest.  Akbar’s policy of incorporating Rajputs into the nobility was a strategic move to consolidate his power and gain their loyalty, though the process was gradual and selective.


Statement 2 is equally accurate in highlighting the aristocratic nature of the Mughal nobility.  Despite the increasing diversity, with Afghans, Indian Muslims, and Hindus gaining prominence, hereditary titles and positions continued to be important factors determining social standing and political influence.  The mansabdari system, though designed to provide avenues for advancement based on merit, still heavily favored those from aristocratic backgrounds.  Thus, the nobility, while becoming more diverse, maintained its fundamentally aristocratic character.  The combination of strategic inclusion and the persistence of aristocratic privilege accurately characterizes the Mughal nobility under Akbar and his successors.


**1. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline in the prestige of Sanskrit contributed to the rise of regional languages, facilitated by the use of vernaculars by Bhakti saints.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate exclusively used Persian for administrative purposes, hindering the growth of regional languages in its domains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the decline of Sanskrit's prestige as a contributing factor to the rise of regional languages. The Bhakti movement's adoption of vernaculars for religious expression played a crucial role in popularizing and developing these languages.  This demonstrates a shift in cultural and linguistic power dynamics, moving away from elite Sanskrit towards more accessible and widely spoken tongues. The use of regional languages by early saints for literary purposes further solidified their prominence.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Persian was indeed an important language of administration in the Delhi Sultanate, the passage indicates that regional languages were also used.  The mention of Hindi-knowing revenue accountants appointed in the Sultanate directly contradicts the claim of exclusive Persian usage.  Furthermore, the development of Telugu literature under the Vijayanagara rulers and Marathi in the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms underscores the co-existence and use of regional languages alongside Persian in various administrative contexts across the medieval period. The Sultanate's fragmentation further led to increased use of local languages for administration in successor states.


**2. With reference to the impact of the Turkish conquest on Indian music, consider the following statements:**

1.  Amir Khusrau's contributions primarily involved the introduction of new musical instruments, like the sitar and tabla, into Indian musical traditions.
2.  The integration of Perso-Arabic musical modes and ragas significantly influenced the development of North Indian classical music.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Amir Khusrau is credited with introducing several Perso-Arabic airs (ragas) and is associated with the invention of the sitar, the passage states that evidence for the sitar's invention is lacking.  The tabla's development is also placed in the late 17th or early 18th century, significantly later than Khusrau's time.  His primary contribution to Indian music lay in the introduction of Perso-Arabic musical elements, not necessarily new instruments.


Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly highlights the significant impact of Perso-Arabic musical modes and airs on the evolution of North Indian classical music. This cultural exchange, facilitated by the Turkish presence, resulted in the incorporation of new scales and styles, leading to a distinctive musical style influenced by Persian music, particularly noticeable in Kashmir. The translation of the Ragadarpan into Persian and the patronage of music by various rulers further demonstrate this integration process. The eventual differentiation between North and South Indian musical modes is attributed, in part, to this incorporation of Perso-Arabic elements.


**3. With reference to the cultural exchange during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal court under Akbar actively promoted the translation of Sanskrit works into Persian, fostering cultural exchange between Hindu and Muslim scholars.
2.  The Bhakti movement remained largely unaffected by Sufi traditions, maintaining distinct religious identities and practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage describes Akbar's court as a hub of cultural exchange, where significant efforts were made to translate Sanskrit works into Persian.  This initiative involved both Hindu and Muslim scholars, demonstrating a deliberate policy to bridge the cultural gap between the two communities.  The translation of the Mahabharata is specifically cited as an example of this active promotion of intercultural understanding.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly points to a significant degree of interaction and mutual influence between the Bhakti and Sufi traditions.  Sufi saints wrote in Hindi, incorporating Bhakti themes into their work, and utilized Bhakti poetry in their musical gatherings (samas). The synthesis of ideas is evident in the works of Malik Muhammad Jaisi's Padmavat, which uses Sufi and Hindu concepts. The common platform created by Bhakti and Sufi traditions formed the background for Akbar's concept of *tawhid*.  This demonstrates a considerable degree of cultural and religious exchange, rather than a complete separation of identities.


**4. With reference to the religious and intellectual climate of 15th and 16th century India, consider the following statements:**

1. Kabir and Nanak, while advocating monotheism, actively promoted the dismantling of the caste system and religious persecution.
2.  The orthodox elements within both Hinduism and Islam wholeheartedly embraced the liberal religious ideas of Kabir and Nanak, leading to widespread social reform.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Kabir and Nanak are presented as strong critics of the existing social order, advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity and strongly denouncing the caste system, particularly untouchability. They emphasized the fundamental unity of humankind, rejecting discrimination based on caste, religion, or wealth.  Their teachings promoted a monotheistic belief system while challenging established religious hierarchies and social inequalities.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage makes it clear that the liberal ideas of Kabir and Nanak were not universally accepted.  The orthodox elements within both Hinduism and Islam resisted these ideas.  The actions of Raghunandan in Bengal, asserting Brahmanical privileges, and Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's opposition to *tawhid* and advocacy for a stricter interpretation of Islam illustrate this resistance.  While Kabir and Nanak's ideas had a lasting impact, they did not lead to immediate and widespread social reform due to the strong opposition from orthodox factions.  The ongoing struggle between liberal and orthodox viewpoints is highlighted as a central theme of the era.


**5. With reference to the architectural styles prevalent in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sher Shah Suri's architectural style represents a culmination of pre-Mughal styles and forms a bridge to the later Mughal architectural traditions.
2.  Mughal architecture exclusively drew inspiration from Persian and Central Asian architectural styles, exhibiting little to no influence from pre-existing Indian styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly identifies Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram and mosque in Delhi as architectural marvels representing the peak of pre-Mughal architecture.  It further states that his style serves as a transition point to the subsequent Mughal architectural style, highlighting a clear lineage and influence.  This demonstrates a continuity in architectural development, with Mughal architects building upon established Indian traditions.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage directly contradicts this claim. It emphasizes that Mughal architecture drew upon the pre-existing Indian tradition of fort-building, citing examples like the forts of Gwalior and Jodhpur as influences.  While Persian and Central Asian influences are acknowledged (e.g., glazed blue tiles, the half-dome portal), the passage clearly indicates a fusion of styles, with Mughal architecture incorporating both foreign and indigenous elements.  The use of various temple pillar styles in Fatehpur Sikri's Panch Mahal further underscores the integration of Indian architectural features into Mughal structures.


**1. With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *amil* headed the *pargana*, a unit below the province.
2.  Villages were grouped into units of 100 to 84, traditionally called *chaurasi*, forming the basis of *parganas*.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the *pargana* was headed by the *amil* and that villages were grouped into units of 100 to 84, termed *chaurasi*, which served as the foundation for the *parganas*.  This directly supports both statements. Option (a) and (b) are incorrect because they exclude one of the factually correct statements. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements accurately reflect the administrative structure described in the text.  Understanding the hierarchical structure of the Delhi Sultanate's administration, from provinces down to villages, is crucial for comprehending its control over the vast territory. The *pargana* system demonstrates a decentralized approach, with local officials responsible for revenue collection and maintaining order within their designated areas. The grouping of villages into units like *chaurasi* indicates an attempt to organize and manage the rural population effectively for taxation and administrative purposes.


**2. With reference to the economic conditions during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. Ibn Battuta's account details the prevalence of two harvests annually in fertile areas, with rice being sown thrice a year.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate's economy primarily relied on a subsistence-level agricultural system with limited urban development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ibn Battuta's detailed account, as mentioned in the passage, confirms the high agricultural productivity of certain regions, capable of yielding two harvests annually, with rice cultivation reaching three harvests in some areas. This directly validates statement 1. However, statement 2 is incorrect. While the passage acknowledges the subsistence level of many peasants, it also highlights the significant growth of urban centers like Delhi and Daulatabad, indicating a flourishing urban economy and extensive trade networks.  Ibn Battuta's observations of diverse products, thriving towns, and robust trade routes contradict the claim of a primarily subsistence-level economy with limited urban development. The Delhi Sultanate's economic system was far more complex, encompassing both rural agriculture and a significant urban commercial sector.  The contrast between the reality and the statement serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between general observations and specific details from primary sources.


**3. With reference to the social structure during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *muqaddam* was a village servant employed by individual peasant families.
2.  The *muqaddam*, along with the *muzari* (landowners), held significant power within the village administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text describes the *muqaddam* as the village headman, a position of authority within the village structure, alongside the *muzari* (landowners). This directly supports statement 2. Statement 1 is incorrect because the passage doesn't portray the *muqaddam* as a servant employed by individual families; instead, it depicts the *muqaddam* as a leading figure in village administration, alongside the landowners. This question tests the candidate's ability to discern the roles and influence of different social groups within the village structure of the Delhi Sultanate.  The contrast between the actual role of the *muqaddam* and the presented misconception in statement 1 is a significant distractor, requiring careful reading and comprehension of the text. The presence of both *muqaddam* and *muzari* within the village governance highlights a complex power dynamic, illustrating the interplay between local leaders and landowning elites.


**4. With reference to the revenue system under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *muqti* was responsible for remitting all revenue collected to the central government, regardless of local expenses.
2.  Firuz Tughlaq implemented reforms that lessened the harshness associated with revenue auditing, including torture and imprisonment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions that Firuz Tughlaq eased the harsh practices during revenue auditing, which included torture and imprisonment of the *muqti*. This directly supports statement 2.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the *muqti* was required to remit the *balance* of income after meeting local expenses. The passage emphasizes that the *muqti* was responsible for managing local expenditures before sending the remaining revenue to the center.  This question tests understanding of the Sultanate's revenue system and the reforms introduced by Firuz Tughlaq. The difference between the actual system and the misrepresented version in statement 1 is a crucial distractor.  The reforms under Firuz Tughlaq represent a significant administrative shift, demonstrating an attempt to improve the relationship between the central government and its local officials, thereby reducing the potential for conflict and rebellion.


**5. With reference to the economic activities during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The introduction of the spinning wheel significantly improved textile production, while the cotton carder's bow remained largely unchanged.
2.  India primarily imported high-grade textiles, glassware, and horses, while exporting raw silk and porcelain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions the improvement in textile production due to the introduction of the spinning wheel, alongside the enhanced use of the cotton carder's bow (*dhunia*). This directly validates statement 1.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage states that India exported fine textiles, while importing high-grade textiles (like satin), glassware, and horses.  The export of raw silk and the import of porcelain are also mentioned, but the framing of statement 2 presents a misleading inversion of the actual trade patterns. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the economic activities and trade during the Delhi Sultanate. The subtle inaccuracies and reversals in statement 2 act as effective distractors. The passage emphasizes the importance of Indian textiles in international trade, highlighting India's role as a major exporter of high-quality goods.  The details regarding the introduction of new technologies and the nature of India's trade relationships require close attention to the text.


**6. With reference to the lifestyle of the Sultan and nobility during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Muhammad Tughlaq's palace, as described by Ibn Battuta, featured a "court of thousand pillars," a large hall with polished wooden pillars and costly furnishings.
2.  The nobility emulated the Sultan's lavish lifestyle, but generally avoided patronage of arts and letters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ibn Battuta's description of Muhammad Tughlaq's palace, including the "court of thousand pillars," directly supports statement 1.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage indicates that while the nobility imitated the Sultan's opulent lifestyle, some nobles also patronized arts and letters. The passage explicitly states that some nobles did support artists and intellectuals. This question tests the candidate's ability to recall details from historical accounts and to differentiate between general trends and specific exceptions. The contrast between the actual behavior of some nobles and the misconception presented in statement 2 forms a significant distractor. The description of Muhammad Tughlaq's palace provides insight into the grandeur and opulence associated with the Sultanate's ruling class. The mention of noble patronage of arts and letters highlights the cultural aspects of the era.


**7. With reference to the urban population during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Slavery was a widespread practice, with slaves being employed in various capacities, including domestic service, handicrafts, and the Sultan's personal bodyguard.
2.  The majority of historians during the Delhi Sultanate were drawn from the ranks of the urban poor and marginalized communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage describes the prevalence of slavery, with slaves employed in diverse roles, including domestic service, handicrafts, and the Sultan's bodyguard. This directly validates statement 1.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage suggests that most historians during the Delhi Sultanate were from the ranks of the *ulama* (Muslim theologians) and lower government officials, not the urban poor.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the social composition of urban areas during the Delhi Sultanate. The contrasting background of historians mentioned in the passage and the statement presented in statement 2 creates a key distractor. The description of slavery highlights the social realities and economic functions of this institution within the urban context.  The passage also subtly points towards the social biases present in historical accounts, indicating that the perspectives of the *ulama* and officials dominated historical writings.


**8. With reference to the agricultural practices during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *rahat* (Persian wheel) was a new irrigation technology introduced by the Turks, significantly improving water access for agriculture.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's land revenue reforms established a direct and equitable relationship between the state and the rural populace, eliminating all forms of exploitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage mentions the *improvement* of the *rahat* (Persian wheel), not its introduction. The text implies that the *rahat* pre-existed but was enhanced for deeper water access. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Although Alauddin Khalji's reforms aimed at a closer state-peasant relationship, the passage doesn't claim that they eliminated all forms of exploitation.  The passage mentions conflicts and peasant rebellions following the reforms, indicating that exploitation wasn't completely eradicated. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the agricultural context and the limitations of specific reforms. The nuanced differences between the actual developments and the overly simplistic claims in both statements serve as crucial distractors.  The passage highlights the importance of irrigation technologies and the complexities of land revenue systems within the Sultanate.


**9. With reference to the military organization of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *iqta* system allowed for the maintenance of large standing armies, but lacked the centralized control seen in other contemporary empires.
2.  The Rajput armies were smaller in number than the Turkish armies due to the caste system's restrictions on participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage describes the *iqta* system as enabling the maintenance of large standing armies, a key factor in the Sultanate's military strength. However, it doesn't explicitly claim that this system lacked centralized control compared to other empires, although it implicitly suggests higher centralization in other contemporary empires. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage actually states that Rajput armies were *larger* in number due to the participation of non-Rajputs, contradicting the statement.  This question tests understanding of the Delhi Sultanate's military organization and its comparison with other contemporary armies. The subtle difference between the implicit and explicit information regarding the *iqta* system's centralization and the direct contradiction in statement 2 are key distractors.  The passage's analysis of Rajput military strengths and weaknesses provides valuable insights into the factors that contributed to the Sultanate's success in military campaigns.


**10. With reference to the impact of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The establishment of the Delhi Sultanate led to immediate and widespread changes across all aspects of Indian society, administration, and cultural life within a century.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate's expansion into South India was primarily driven by religious motives, leading to widespread destruction of Hindu temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Delhi Sultanate had a profound and long-lasting impact, the passage indicates that the effects of its establishment were felt gradually over a longer period, not immediately and across all aspects of life within a single century. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Although some temple destruction occurred, the passage doesn't claim that religious motives were the primary driver of the Sultanate's expansion into South India. Political and strategic considerations, including control over trade routes and resources, played a more significant role. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the long-term consequences of the Delhi Sultanate and its expansionist policies.  The exaggerated claims and misrepresentation of motives in both statements are effective distractors.  The passage highlights the complex interplay of political, economic, and social factors that shaped the Sultanate's impact on India.


**1. With reference to the social and economic life in Medieval South India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kings, despite minimal personal attire, adorned themselves lavishly with gold and precious stones during public processions.
2.  While vegetarianism was prevalent, the consumption of peacock, horse, wild ass, wild cock, and wild pig was considered permissible according to some Smriti writers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that even though the kings of South India wore simple cotton loincloths in their daily lives, they wore elaborate gold jewelry, including hats, armlets, and anklets studded with pearls and gems, during official processions. This directly supports statement 1.  The text also mentions that while vegetarianism was common, certain Smriti writers detailed occasions where the consumption of specific animals (peacock, horse, wild ass, wild cock, and wild pig) was deemed acceptable. This directly supports statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of social and economic life in Medieval South India as described in the text.  The contrast between simple daily attire and opulent ceremonial dress highlights the social hierarchy and the importance of public display of power and wealth. The information regarding dietary practices sheds light on the complexities of social norms and religious interpretations.


**2. With reference to entertainment and pastimes in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Animal fights (rams, cocks) and wrestling were popular among the masses, while the upper classes favored dicing and hunting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly indicates that animal fights (rams and cocks) and wrestling were popular forms of entertainment among the common people.  This directly supports statement 1.  The text further states that the upper classes enjoyed dicing and hunting, reinforcing the class-based difference in leisure activities.  The mention of a "kind of Indian polo" specifically identified as a royal pastime further supports statement 2, demonstrating the exclusive nature of certain forms of entertainment.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the diversity and class distinctions in recreational activities during the medieval period. The contrast emphasizes the social stratification and the different ways in which various segments of society spent their leisure time.


**3. With reference to education in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The education system largely focused on vocational training, with guilds and families responsible for teaching crafts and professions.
2.  Higher education, mainly in Vedic branches, grammar, logic, philosophy, and politics, was often imparted through gurukuls, requiring fees or personal service from students.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the responsibility for training in crafts and professions rested primarily with guilds and individual families, indicating a predominantly vocational focus to education.  This directly corroborates statement 1. The text also describes the system of higher education, emphasizing the role of gurukuls where students would reside with their teachers and pay fees or offer personal service, especially if they were impoverished. The subjects taught, such as Vedic branches, grammar, logic, philosophy, and politics, are also mentioned, supporting statement 2. Thus, both statements accurately depict the structure and focus of the medieval Indian education system, highlighting the blend of vocational and academic training and the social dynamics within the gurukul system.


**4. With reference to the state of science and learning in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline in surgery was attributed to the association of dissection with lower castes, leading to barbers taking over the profession.
2.  While advancements were made in mathematics (Lilavati), astronomy was overshadowed by astrology, hindering scientific progress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text directly explains the decline in surgery by linking it to the social stigma of dissection being associated with lower castes. This resulted in the profession being largely taken over by barbers, supporting statement 1. The passage also notes advancements in mathematics, specifically mentioning Bhaskara II's Lilavati, while simultaneously highlighting the dominance of astrology over astronomy, which hampered the overall progress of scientific inquiry.  This supports statement 2.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the complex interplay of social factors and scientific developments during the medieval period. The decline in surgery exemplifies the impact of social norms on scientific practices, while the comparison between mathematics and astronomy illustrates the selective nature of scientific progress.


**5. With reference to religious movements and beliefs in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of Buddhism and Jainism was accompanied by persecution of monks and the takeover of their temples, indicating religious conflict.
2.  The rise of tantric practices within Buddhism, involving magical words and gestures, contributed to its assimilation into Hinduism.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text describes instances of persecution of Buddhist and Jain monks and the appropriation of their temples, suggesting religious conflict and the decline of these faiths. This directly supports statement 1. The passage also details the emergence of tantric practices within Buddhism, characterized by magical words, gestures, and austerities, leading to its gradual indistinguishability from Hinduism. This supports statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the religious dynamics of the medieval period, showcasing the decline of some faiths and the transformation and blending of others. The account highlights the complex interplay of religious beliefs, practices, and political power in shaping the religious landscape of medieval India.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text describes Namadeva's Marathi poetry as expressing intense love and devotion to God, and mentions his interactions with Sufi saints in Delhi. This directly supports statement 1. The passage also explains how the saint-poets utilized the Radha-Krishna love story as an allegory to depict the bond between the individual soul and the supreme soul, supporting statement 2.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the literary contributions of the Bhakti movement, highlighting its use of vernacular languages and allegorical storytelling to convey profound spiritual messages. The combination of intense devotion and allegorical narratives showcases the movement's unique literary style and its impact on religious expression.


**8. With reference to the impact of the Bhakti and Sufi movements, consider the following statements:**

1.  While the movements softened the rigidity of the caste system, they did not fully dismantle it.

This supports statement 1.  The text further emphasizes that the teachings of Kabir and Nanak created an atmosphere of religious tolerance that significantly influenced later rulers, particularly Akbar, whose policies reflected their ideals. This supports statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the multifaceted impact of these movements, highlighting their limitations and their lasting influence on religious and political thought.

The passage also highlights the flourishing of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi, noting the creation of high-quality literature often based on themes from Hindu epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata. This supports statement 2.  Therefore, both statements accurately depict the rich cultural landscape of the Medieval period, emphasizing the interaction between different linguistic and religious traditions and the growth of vernacular literature.  The confluence of Persian and Indian cultural elements showcases the dynamism and complexity of the era.

The contrast emphasizes the complexity of social and economic structures and the need for a nuanced understanding of the period.


**1. With reference to the administration of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *wazir*, initially primarily a military leader, evolved into a revenue expert by the 14th century, overseeing both income and expenditure.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's army, while exceptionally large according to some accounts, was notably efficient due to his implementation of cash salaries and a horse-branding system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly details the *wazir*'s evolution from a primarily military role in earlier periods to a more prominent role in revenue administration by the 14th century under rulers like Muhammad Tughlaq.  The establishment of an Auditor General and an Accountant General under the *wazir* further underscores this shift in responsibilities. This reflects a growing complexity and sophistication in the Sultanate's financial management.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text highlights Alauddin Khalji's significant contributions to military organization. While the figure of 300,000 soldiers might be an exaggeration, the text emphasizes the efficiency brought about by his reforms, including the switch to cash salaries (ending the hereditary village assignments) and the introduction of the horse-branding system (*dagh*) to maintain army quality.  These reforms directly contributed to his success in containing Mongol invasions and expanding the Sultanate's power. The shift from hereditary land assignments to cash payments was a crucial administrative and economic reform that improved the Sultanate's control over its military and eliminated inefficiency.


**2. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajendra I's naval expeditions against the Srivijaya Empire were primarily motivated by a desire to control the spice trade routes to China.
2.  The Chola administration, while centralized, significantly encouraged local self-government in villages through assemblies like the *ur* and *sabha* or *mahasabha*.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text indicates that while the Cholas had cordial relations with Srivijaya initially, the Chola's naval expeditions against Srivijaya were driven by a desire to remove obstacles to Indian trade and expand trade with China.  This suggests a strong economic motivation behind Rajendra I's military actions, demonstrating the importance of controlling trade routes in the Chola Empire's foreign policy. The control of sea routes was vital for the Chola economy and power projection.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Chola administration, while having a centralized structure with the king at its apex, is described as having a significant emphasis on local self-government. The text specifically mentions the *ur* and the *sabha* or *mahasabha* as village assemblies, particularly highlighting the autonomy enjoyed by Brahman villages (*agraharams*) and their involvement in land management, revenue collection, and even loan raising. This showcases a sophisticated balance between centralized authority and decentralized governance, a hallmark of the Chola administrative system.  The *mahasabha*'s power to distribute lands demonstrates significant local control.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's reign witnessed the payment of tribute to Vijayanagara by kingdoms as far as Pegu and Tenasserim, signifying Vijayanagara's extensive influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct, but ultimately misleading. The text mentions that kingdoms like Pegu and Tenasserim sent tribute to Deva Raya II, however, it also qualifies this by stating that it's doubtful whether Vijayanagara had the naval strength to enforce regular tribute from these distant locations.  The "tribute" might instead represent diplomatic gifts or exchanges, implying a less absolute control than the statement suggests.  UPSC questions often test nuanced understanding of historical claims.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly outlines the structure of the Vijayanagara Empire, showing a clear centralized system headed by the king, but also highlighting the significant power and autonomy of the provincial governors, the *nayaks*. These *nayaks*, often from vassal families or nobles, held considerable power, including maintaining their own armies and issuing their own coins.  Their potential to challenge central authority is explicitly mentioned, underscoring a key aspect of Vijayanagara's internal dynamics and eventual decline. The significant autonomy of the *nayaks* contributed to the empire's internal weaknesses.


**4.  With reference to the Bengal Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign is notable for its religious tolerance, evident in the appointment of Hindus to high administrative positions.
2.  The Bengal Sultanate's attempts to conquer the Brahmaputra Valley met with consistent resistance from the Ahom kingdom, ultimately leading to the establishment of a clear border along the Karatoya River.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Alauddin Hussain Shah's liberal policies, including the appointment of Hindus to key positions such as wazir, chief physician, and commander of the bodyguard.  This demonstrates a notable departure from stricter religious policies of previous rulers and reflects a pragmatic approach to governance in a predominantly Hindu population.  This aspect showcases the Sultanate's adaptability and political strategy.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text details the Bengal Sultanate's repeated, yet unsuccessful, attempts to control the Brahmaputra Valley.  The Ahom kingdom's consistent resistance is highlighted, culminating in the acceptance of the Karatoya River as the northeastern boundary of Bengal. This underscores the limitations of the Sultanate's power and the significant military strength of the Ahom kingdom. The unsuccessful campaigns against the Ahoms highlight the geopolitical realities of the region.


**5. With reference to the Pala Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Dharmapala's extensive empire, reaching the northwestern limits of India, included areas like Malwa and Berar under his suzerainty.
2. The Pala rulers, while primarily patrons of Buddhism, also extended patronage to Saivism and Vaishnavism, fostering religious pluralism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an overstatement. While the text mentions Dharmapala's empire extending to the northwestern limits and possibly including Malwa and Berar, it also states that he could not consolidate his power and eventually faced setbacks. The claim of complete control over these regions is not fully substantiated.  It's important to distinguish between claimed suzerainty and actual effective control in evaluating historical claims.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that despite being strong supporters of Buddhism, the Pala rulers also extended their patronage to Saivism and Vaishnavism.  This demonstrates a policy of religious tolerance and pluralism, indicating a pragmatic approach to governance within a diverse religious landscape.  This religious tolerance contributed to the stability and prosperity of the empire.  The invitation of Buddhist scholars from Tibet further highlights the empire's cosmopolitan character.


**6. With reference to the Pratihara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bhoja, the greatest Pratihara ruler, successfully extended his empire's reach to the western side of the Sutlej River, as evidenced by inscriptions.
2.  The Pratihara Empire's vastness, as described by Al-Masudi, included an enormous number of villages and cities, along with a massive army organized into four distinct divisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that Bhoja's territories extended to the western side of the Sutlej River, as indicated by inscriptions.  This demonstrates the geographical extent of his reign and the empire's significant reach into the northwest.  The mention of inscriptions provides verifiable evidence for this claim.

Statement 2 is also correct. Al-Masudi's account, as cited in the text, describes the Pratihara Empire's immense size, encompassing a vast number of villages and cities.  The text also notes Al-Masudi's description of the Pratihara army's organization into four divisions, each with a substantial number of soldiers (though the exact figures may be exaggerated). This illustrates the empire's military might and organizational capacity.  While the numbers provided by Al-Masudi may be inflated, the underlying point about the size and structure of the army is valid.


**7. With reference to the military organization of the three major empires (Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta), consider the following statements:**

1. All three empires utilized war chariots as a significant component of their military strategies.
2. The Pala infantry included soldiers from diverse regions across India, such as Malwa, Assam, Gujarat, and Karnataka.

This requires the candidate to recall specific military campaigns and their geographic scope.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur stands as a testament to the Chola rulers' patronage of temple architecture.  Built during the reign of Rajaraja I (completed in 1010), it is a significant example of Chola architectural prowess and a reflection of the empire's wealth and power. The temple's construction is associated with the commemoration of victories. This tests the candidate's knowledge of Chola art and architecture, requiring the ability to link specific monuments to rulers and periods.  The precision in mentioning the completion date adds a layer of difficulty.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is followed by a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to Akbar's land revenue system, consider the following statements:**

1. The *zabti* system, also known as Todar Mal's *bardobast*, involved measuring the land under cultivation and assessing revenue based on average produce and prices over the past ten years.
2. The *bazai* or *ghalia-bakiishi* system involved a fixed proportion of the produce being divided between the peasants and the state, requiring a large number of officials present during harvest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's land revenue system.  Statement 1 correctly describes the *zabti* system, emphasizing its meticulous measurement of land and calculation of revenue based on a ten-year average.  The association with Raja Todar Mal is also historically accurate, though he was part of a team that developed the system.  Statement 2 accurately portrays the *bazai* system's reliance on a fixed proportion of the produce shared between peasants and the state.  The inherent challenge of this system, requiring a large, honest official presence during harvest, is also correctly highlighted.  The contrast between the two systems—*zabti*'s systematic assessment and *bazai*'s more direct, share-based approach—demonstrates Akbar's attempts to refine revenue collection.  The option (c) "Both 1 and 2" is thus the most appropriate answer.


**2. With reference to the Mansabdari system under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *mansab* rank was initially a single numerical designation but later divided into *zat* (personal status and salary) and *sawar* (number of cavalrymen to be maintained).
2.  The *dagh* system involved branding horses with imperial marks and maintaining a descriptive roll of each soldier to ensure the quality of the cavalry force.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct and reflect key components of Akbar's Mansabdari system.  Statement 1 correctly explains the evolution of the *mansab* system from a single rank to a dual system of *zat* and *sawar*, which clarified the responsibilities and compensation of each officer.  This demonstrates Akbar’s administrative sophistication in managing his military and nobility.  Statement 2 accurately describes the *dagh* system, highlighting its role in maintaining the quality and efficiency of the cavalry.  The system of branding horses and detailed soldier records served as a crucial check against fraud and ensured a well-maintained military.  The combined accuracy of both statements makes option (c) the correct choice.


**3. With reference to Alauddin Khalji's economic policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's market control measures extended to fixing the prices of all commodities, from food grains to slaves, establishing designated markets in Delhi under the supervision of *shahnas*.
2. Alauddin Khalji's agrarian reforms included the direct collection of land revenue in the Doab region, raising the state's share to half the produce and enforcing land measurement to prevent tax evasion by the wealthy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Alauddin Khalji's economic policies. Statement 1 correctly describes his comprehensive market control, extending to a wide range of goods and employing strict oversight to maintain fixed prices. The establishment of specific markets and the appointment of *shahnas* highlight the centralized and authoritarian nature of his approach.  Statement 2 correctly outlines his agrarian reforms, including the direct collection of land revenue in the Doab, increased state share, and land measurement to curb tax evasion by powerful landowners. This demonstrates his attempt to consolidate state power and ensure a stable supply of resources for the army and the state.  The comprehensive and interconnected nature of his policies makes (c) the correct answer.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the economic and social conditions in Medieval India:**

1.  European accounts consistently highlight the stark contrast between the wealth and ostentatious lifestyles of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty among peasants, artisans, and laborers.
2. The staple diet of the common people consisted primarily of rice, millet, pulses, and in some regions, fish and meat, with wheat-based chapatis prevalent in North India.

Statement 1 correctly notes the observations of European travelers regarding the vast disparity in wealth between the elite and the common populace. This observation highlights the social stratification and economic inequalities that characterized the period. Statement 2 correctly describes the dietary habits of the common people, outlining the staple foods that constituted their sustenance. The regional variations in food consumption are also accurately represented, reflecting the diverse agricultural practices of the time.  The combined accuracy of both statements makes (c) the correct answer.


**5. With reference to the Chola Empire (900-1200 CE), consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's military campaigns resulted in the conquest of parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, and the weakening of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms.
2.  Rajendra I expanded the Chola empire further by conquering the remaining Pandya and Chera territories, completely subjugating Sri Lanka, and expanding into Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe aspects of the Chola Empire's expansion under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I. Statement 1 accurately reflects Rajaraja I's military achievements, including his conquests in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, and his weakening of rival kingdoms in South India. These conquests were driven by strategic and economic considerations, aiming to control trade routes and consolidate power. Statement 2 correctly describes Rajendra I's continuation of the expansionist policy, completing the conquest of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms and achieving full control over Sri Lanka.  While the extent of Chola influence in Southeast Asia is debated, the statement does not claim outright conquest of those territories, making it factually accurate in this context. The combined accuracy of both statements makes (c) the correct option.


**1. With reference to medieval Indian society and economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajputs, a powerful class of landed chiefs, primarily traced their ancestry to the solar and lunar families of the Kshatriyas mentioned in the Mahabharata, solidifying their claim to Kshatriya status.
2.  The growing power of Samantas, who were often initially government officials granted revenue-bearing villages, led to a hierarchical system where some dominated entire regions while others remained village chiefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the decentralized political structure of medieval India.  Samantas, a diverse group encompassing former officials, defeated rulers, and local chiefs, held varying degrees of power.  While some controlled vast territories, others remained influential only within a single village. This hierarchical structure, marked by constant competition and shifting alliances, is a crucial aspect of understanding medieval Indian politics and the evolution of power dynamics.

Statement 1 presents a partially inaccurate portrayal of Rajput origins. While many Rajput clans did indeed trace their lineage to the solar and lunar Kshatriya families of the Mahabharata, this was largely a legitimizing strategy.  Modern scholarship emphasizes the complex process of social mobility and the merging of various social groups into the Rajput identity.  Rajputs were not solely descended from these ancient Kshatriya lineages; their origins were often mixed, incorporating elements of foreign groups (like the Shakas and Hunas) and indigenous tribes. The claim of descent from the Mahabharata's Kshatriya families served a political and social purpose, strengthening their position in the hierarchical caste system.


**2. With reference to the economic conditions of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers consistently reported widespread prosperity throughout India, with only minor pockets of poverty existing in larger cities.
2.  The staple diet of the common people consisted primarily of rice, millet, pulses, and occasionally fish or meat, depending on regional availability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 reflects the accurate depiction of the dietary habits of the common population in medieval India.  Rice, millet, and pulses formed the foundation of their meals, with regional variations including fish (coastal areas and Bengal) and meat (southern peninsula). This simple diet, reflecting the economic realities of the time, underscores the prevalent poverty experienced by the majority.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While certain sections of society, particularly the ruling classes and wealthy merchants, enjoyed opulent lifestyles, accounts from European travelers consistently highlight the stark contrast: widespread poverty among peasants, artisans, and laborers.  The descriptions of scanty clothing, simple housing, and limited access to resources paint a picture of widespread economic hardship, contradicting the notion of uniform prosperity. The accounts emphasize the disparity between the wealthy elite and the impoverished masses.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's empire extended its influence to include regular tributary payments from kingdoms as far as Pegu and Tenasserim, demonstrating significant naval power.
2.  Abdur Razzaq, a Persian traveler, described Vijayanagara as having seven concentric citadels and walls, with four extensive bazaars categorized by caste or profession.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes Abdur Razzaq's account of Vijayanagara's impressive urban design.  His detailed description of the concentric citadels, extensive bazaars organized by occupation and caste, and the presence of numerous canals showcases the city's scale, sophistication, and adherence to traditional urban planning principles. This account provides valuable insights into the city's infrastructure and social organization.

Statement 1 presents a misleading interpretation of the extent of Vijayanagara's power. While Deva Raya II maintained contact with rulers in Sri Lanka, Pulicat, and possibly Pegu and Tenasserim, the claim of regular tribute is debatable.  The nature of these relationships was likely more complex, involving diplomatic exchanges and gifts rather than consistent tributary payments.  Vijayanagara did possess naval capabilities, but their capacity to enforce tribute across such vast distances is questionable, making the statement hyperbolic.  


**4. With reference to the religious and social movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement, primarily led by Nayanmars and Alvars in South India, strongly opposed the caste system, actively working to dismantle its hierarchical structure.
2.  The Lingayat or Virashaiva movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, rejected traditional Hindu practices like elaborate rituals, pilgrimages, and sacrifices, while advocating social reforms such as widow remarriage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the core tenets and social reforms championed by the Lingayat movement.  Basava and Channabasava's rejection of traditional Hindu rituals, emphasis on direct devotion to Shiva, and advocacy for social reforms like widow remarriage and opposition to child marriage are well-documented aspects of this transformative movement.  Their challenge to the established social order was a significant aspect of their religious and social reform agenda.

Statement 1 presents an oversimplification of the Bhakti movement's stance on the caste system. While the Bhakti saints emphasized devotion and love for God, making the path to salvation accessible to all regardless of caste, they did not actively seek to dismantle the caste system itself.  Many Bhakti saints came from lower castes, and their teachings promoted social inclusion and challenged the Brahmanical hegemony, but they didn't directly aim to abolish the caste system. The movement's impact on caste was indirect, promoting social harmony through shared religious experiences.


**5. With reference to the economic and social life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate's economy witnessed a significant expansion of agricultural production due to improvements in irrigation techniques, such as the rahat (Persian wheel), leading to relative affluence.
2.  Despite the Sultanate's formal adherence to Islamic law, the Sultans often prioritized practical considerations over strict religious adherence in governance, as evidenced by Alauddin Khalji's pragmatic approach to lawmaking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Delhi Sultanate's economic and political landscape. Statement 1 correctly points to the advancements in irrigation technology (like the improved rahat) that boosted agricultural output, contributing to a period of relative prosperity during the Sultanate. This agricultural growth was a significant factor in the overall economic development of the period.

Statement 2 highlights the pragmatic approach adopted by the Sultans in governance. While the Sultanate was formally Islamic, rulers like Alauddin Khalji prioritized practical concerns and state needs over strict adherence to religious law. Alauddin's pragmatic approach to lawmaking, prioritizing the stability and functioning of the state, exemplifies this blend of religious and secular considerations in governance.  This pragmatic approach was necessary to manage a diverse population with varying religious and social backgrounds.



**1. With reference to the Ghaznavid Empire and its impact on India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's raids were primarily motivated by a desire to acquire wealth from India's rich temples and towns, supplementing his resources for ongoing conflicts in Central Asia.
2.  The Hindushahi rulers, despite initial setbacks, offered prolonged and significant resistance to Mahmud of Ghazni's incursions into the Punjab region, receiving little support from Rajput rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Mahmud of Ghazni's raids into the Indo-Gangetic plains aimed at plundering wealthy temples and towns. This wealth was crucial in funding his ongoing battles in Central Asia.  His actions weren't solely focused on religious zealotry; economic gain was a significant motivator.  This highlights the complex interplay of religious fervor and pragmatic resource acquisition in medieval warfare.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage details the protracted struggle between the Hindushahi rulers and Mahmud of Ghazni.  Despite initial defeats and the annexation of Kabul and Jalalabad, the Shahis continued to resist Ghazni's attempts to penetrate deeper into the Punjab. The text emphasizes their largely solitary fight, noting the lack of substantial Rajput support, despite some historical claims to the contrary which are deemed dubious by the text. This demonstrates the limitations of alliances and the internal dynamics of power within India at the time.  The absence of widespread Rajput aid underscores the fragmented political landscape of northern India before the establishment of centralized power.


**2. With reference to the economic and social conditions of India during the early medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of long-distance trade within India during this period led to the decline of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs) in North India, with some older guilds eventually transforming into sub-castes.
2.  While the ruling classes enjoyed ostentatious lifestyles, European accounts consistently highlight the widespread poverty among ordinary Indian people, including peasants, artisans, and laborers, characterized by limited clothing and basic housing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a significant economic shift. The passage describes how the reduction in long-distance trade within India impacted trade guilds.  These guilds, often multi-caste organizations with legal frameworks and financial functions, lost prominence. The transformation of some into sub-castes illustrates the social and economic ramifications of this change, showing how economic structures influenced caste dynamics.  This showcases the interconnectedness of economic and social structures in shaping early medieval Indian society.


Statement 2 is supported by the text's analysis of European travelers' accounts. These accounts consistently portray a stark contrast between the opulence of the ruling class and the grinding poverty faced by the majority of the population.  Descriptions of limited clothing, basic mud houses with minimal furniture, and a staple diet of rice, millet, and pulses paint a picture of widespread hardship. The accounts of Babur, Ralph Fitch, and De Laet provide corroborating evidence, demonstrating the reliability of these observations about the disparity in living standards. This underscores the importance of using multiple sources and perspectives to understand historical realities, and the complexities of economic inequality.


**3. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate's administration and economic life, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate's administration at the local level initially saw minimal changes, with land revenue collection largely continuing through existing systems and personnel, facilitating the quick establishment of Turkish authority in the countryside.
2.  The flourishing urban economy of the Delhi Sultanate, marked by the growth of major cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, Lahore, and Multan, stimulated large-scale commerce and the production of high-quality textiles and handicrafts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies a key factor in the early success of the Delhi Sultanate. The text points out that the initial establishment of Turkish rule in the countryside involved minimal disruption of existing administrative structures.  The continuity in land revenue collection methods and personnel helped ensure a smooth transition of power and prevented widespread resistance. This highlights the pragmatic approach of the early Delhi Sultans in consolidating their authority.  This strategy minimized immediate conflicts and allowed for gradual implementation of changes.


Statement 2 accurately describes the economic prosperity associated with the Delhi Sultanate. The growth of major cities, as noted in the text, points towards a thriving urban economy.  The production of high-quality textiles and handicrafts, particularly in Bengal and Gujarat, fueled significant commerce, both domestically and internationally. Ibn Battuta's account of Delhi as a major city in the Islamic world further corroborates this economic dynamism.  This demonstrates the economic impact of political stability and the development of trade routes.  The mention of specific cities and products adds credibility to this assessment.


**4. With reference to the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1. Muhammad Tughlaq's decision to shift the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad, while intended to improve control over South India, ultimately failed due to the difficulties of relocation and widespread discontent among the population.
2. The introduction of token currency during Muhammad Tughlaq's reign, though based on successful experiments in other regions, proved unsuccessful in India due to widespread counterfeiting and the inability of the government to effectively control it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the outcome of Muhammad Tughlaq's ambitious capital relocation. The text explains that the transfer of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad, while motivated by strategic considerations of better control over the south, proved disastrous. The immense logistical challenges, the hardships faced by those who migrated, and the widespread homesickness among those relocated led to significant discontent.  The sultan's eventual abandonment of Daulatabad demonstrates the failure of this policy. This highlights the importance of considering practical challenges alongside strategic goals in governance.


Statement 2 correctly assesses the failure of Muhammad Tughlaq's token currency experiment.  While the concept was not entirely novel, having been tried elsewhere, its implementation in India failed due to widespread counterfeiting. The government's inability to prevent forgery undermined the value of the new currency, ultimately leading to its withdrawal. The story of the heaps of worthless coins outside the fort illustrates the scale of this failure. This demonstrates the risk of implementing untested economic policies and the importance of robust mechanisms to prevent fraud.  The contrast between the theoretical basis and the practical failure highlights the limitations of applying successful foreign models without considering local contexts.


**5. With reference to the social and religious dynamics of early medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kayastha caste, emerging prominently during this period, comprised individuals from various castes who worked in royal establishments, illustrating the fluidity and evolution of the caste system.
2. While the position of Shudras improved gradually, with increased access to certain rituals, the social position of Dalits deteriorated during this period, facing increased social exclusion and restrictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the formation of the Kayastha caste. The text explains that this caste emerged from a heterogeneous group of individuals from different castes who served in royal administrations.  This illustrates the dynamic nature of the caste system, where social mobility and the creation of new caste groups were possible, albeit often through occupation and service to the ruling class. This shows the caste system wasn't static but rather evolved and adapted to changing circumstances. The origins of this caste are presented as an example of the flexibility within the seeming rigidity of the caste system.


Statement 2 accurately reflects the contrasting social trajectories of Shudras and Dalits. The passage notes a gradual improvement in the social standing of Shudras, who gained access to certain smarta rituals.  However, it simultaneously points to a decline in the status of Dalits (untouchables), who faced increased social exclusion and restrictions, including limitations on land ownership and enforced segregation. This highlights the complex and often contradictory social dynamics within the caste system, where some groups experienced upward mobility while others experienced further marginalization.  The description of the treatment of Dalits underscores the persistence of social inequality despite some changes within the system.


**1. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah in Bengal (1493-1519), consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule is considered a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, marked by the flourishing of several prominent Bengali writers.
2.  Despite his efforts to maintain law and order and adopt a liberal policy, Alauddin Hussain Shah's attempts to conquer the Brahmaputra valley were consistently unsuccessful, ultimately leading to the destruction of the Kamata kingdom.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) was a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, with many famous Bengali writers flourishing under his rule. This highlights his patronage of literature and arts, contributing to the development of Bengali language and literature.  This is a key aspect of understanding the cultural and linguistic developments during the medieval period in Bengal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Alauddin Hussain Shah did attempt to conquer the Brahmaputra valley and faced resistance from Kamata and the Ahom kingdom, the statement misrepresents the outcome.  The passage indicates that his campaign, *supported by the Ahoms*, successfully led to the destruction of Kamatapur and its annexation to Bengal.  The Ahoms were not consistently opposing him; rather, they allied with him against Kamata.  His subsequent attack on the Ahom kingdom itself was unsuccessful, but this does not invalidate the success of his campaign against Kamata.  This demonstrates the complexities of regional power dynamics in medieval India and the importance of understanding alliances and shifting power balances.


**2. With reference to the economic and social life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate saw a flourishing urban economy, evidenced by the growth of major cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, and Cambay, known for their production of textiles, gold and silver work, and other handicrafts.
2.  Despite the overall growth of trade and commerce, the economic conditions of ordinary peasants remained largely unchanged, characterized by subsistence living, recurring famines, and exploitation by local landlords and officials.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage details the growth of major cities under the Delhi Sultanate, highlighting their economic significance.  Cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, Lahore, Multan, Cambay, and Sonargaon are mentioned, with specific examples of their trade and production (textiles, gold and silver work, etc.). This illustrates the development of urban centers as hubs of economic activity during this period. The mention of a "flourishing urban economy" directly supports this statement.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The passage contrasts the prosperity of urban centers with the harsh realities faced by the majority of the population—the peasants. It describes their subsistence living, the recurring famines and wars, and the exploitation by landlords (muqtis, zamindars) and officials.  This paints a picture of social inequality and economic hardship for a significant portion of the population, despite the overall economic growth experienced by the Sultanate.  This is crucial for understanding the complexities of economic development during the period and the uneven distribution of its benefits.


**3. With reference to the Rajput states and their relationship with the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajput rulers actively resisted the initial Turkish raids into the Gangetic Valley and Rajputana, achieving several victories against the Ghaznavids before the Ghurid conquests.
2.  While initially resisting Turkish incursions, the Rajput states also engaged in trade relations with Muslim merchants and welcomed Sufi preachers, leading to a degree of interaction between Hindu and Muslim societies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage describes the Rajput resistance against the Ghaznavids, highlighting their military victories against the early Turkish incursions.  This resistance is presented as a significant aspect of the early interactions between the Rajput states and the invading forces.  The description of spirited resistance and specific victories clearly supports this statement.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage clearly describes the coexistence of military conflict and trade relations between the Rajput states and the Muslims. The passage specifically mentions that Muslim traders were "allowed, even welcomed" in Rajput territories, and that Sufi preachers influenced both Muslim settlers and some Hindus. This points to a complex relationship characterized by both conflict and interaction, illustrating the nuanced dynamics of cultural exchange during this historical period.


**4.  With reference to the cultural and religious landscape during the period of the Delhi Sultanate and regional kingdoms, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi during this period is partly attributed to the decline in Sanskrit's prestige, the use of vernacular languages by Bhakti saints, and the adoption of regional languages for administrative purposes in some kingdoms.
2.  While the Delhi Sultanate and regional kingdoms exhibited some degree of religious tolerance,  the integration of Persian and Arabic musical influences into Indian classical music was a significant example of cultural fusion.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly mentions the rise of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi. It attributes this development to several factors: the decline of Sanskrit's prestige, the Bhakti movement's use of vernacular languages, and the adoption of these languages for administrative purposes in various kingdoms. This showcases the linguistic shifts and the emergence of new literary traditions during this period.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage discusses the integration of Persian and Arabic musical influences into Indian classical music.  Amir Khusrau's contributions and the patronage of music by various rulers are cited as examples of this cultural fusion.  This highlights the cross-cultural exchange and the creation of a unique musical style that blended different traditions.  The mention of new musical instruments, ragas, and the translation of musical texts further strengthens this point.


**5. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and its relationship with neighboring powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's reign saw Vijayanagara at its zenith, controlling extensive territories and receiving tribute from various kingdoms, including Sri Lanka, but the empire's later history was marked by internal conflicts and struggles for succession.
2.  The Bahmani kingdom, under Mahmud Gawan's leadership, expanded its territory, particularly along the western coast, posing a significant challenge to Vijayanagara's dominance and impacting its trade routes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage highlights Deva Raya II's reign as a period of significant power and influence for the Vijayanagara empire.  The description of its vast territories and the receipt of tribute from various kingdoms support this. However, the passage also notes the subsequent internal conflicts and struggles for succession that weakened the empire, leading to its eventual decline.  This shows the cyclical nature of empire building and the challenges of maintaining power.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage details Mahmud Gawan's role in expanding the Bahmani kingdom, particularly along the western coast, including the capture of important ports like Goa and Dabhol. This expansion directly challenged Vijayanagara's dominance and significantly impacted its trade routes and economic strength.  The description of the Bahmani kingdom's expansion and its impact on Vijayanagara's trade directly supports this.  The mention of the struggles between the two empires over strategic territories further underscores their complex relationship.


**6. With reference to the Chola Empire and its administration, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola administration was characterized by a strong centralized authority vested in the king, but it also incorporated a significant degree of local self-government, particularly in Brahman villages (agraharams), through assemblies like the Sabha and Ur.
2.  The Chola military strength was based on a large army comprising elephants, cavalry, and infantry, supported by a powerful navy that dominated the Bay of Bengal and facilitated the empire's overseas trade and expansion.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage describes the Chola administration as having a centralized authority in the king, but it also highlights the importance of local self-government, especially in Brahman villages (agraharams).  The Sabha and Ur assemblies are presented as key institutions of this local self-governance, illustrating a decentralized aspect of the Chola administrative system.  This demonstrates a balanced approach to governance, combining centralized control with local autonomy.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Chola military is described as possessing a strong army with elephants, cavalry, and infantry.  The passage also emphasizes the strength of the Chola navy, its dominance in the Bay of Bengal, and its crucial role in the empire's overseas trade and expansion. This highlights the empire's military might and its ability to project power both on land and sea, crucial elements in understanding its success and reach.  The mention of naval expeditions and control over sea routes further supports this.


**7.  With reference to the economic and social conditions in India during the post-Gupta period, consider the following statements:**

1. The growth of a system akin to feudalism, with the rise of powerful regional chiefs (samantas, etc.), increased the burden on the common people through additional taxes, forced labor, and the exploitation of peasants.
2. While the caste system continued, there were changes within it, including the strengthening of the Brahmanical position and the emergence of new castes and sub-castes, often through a process of social mobility and integration of various groups.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the text's description of the socio-economic conditions. The rise of regional chiefs, their accumulation of power, and the consequent increase in taxes and forced labor on peasants are clearly mentioned. The text also describes the hardships faced by the common people due to famines and wars, further substantiating the statement.  This highlights the social and economic changes that shaped the post-Gupta period.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the changes within the caste system. The text explicitly mentions the strengthening of the Brahmanical position and the emergence of new castes and sub-castes, often through social mobility. The text also discusses the Rajputs and their complex relationship with Brahmins, illustrating the fluidity and adaptation within the caste structure.  This demonstrates the evolving nature of social hierarchies and the adaptation of the caste system to changing circumstances.


**8. With reference to the cultural developments during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The patronage extended by Rajput rulers to Sanskrit literature, along with the contributions of Jain scholars like Hemachandra, contributed to the ongoing development of Sanskrit and other regional languages like Apabhramsha and Prakrit.
2.  The integration of Persian and Arabic influences into various art forms, particularly music, is evident in the introduction of new musical instruments, ragas, and the patronage of music by rulers like Sultan Husain Sharqi of Jaunpur and Raja Man Singh of Gwalior.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the text's discussion on the cultural scene.  The patronage of Sanskrit literature by Rajput rulers and the significant contributions of Jain scholars like Hemachandra in Sanskrit and Apabhramsha are explicitly mentioned.  This illustrates the continued importance of Sanskrit and the evolution of other regional languages.  The mention of Vastupala's patronage and the literary output of the period strengthens this.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text highlights the fusion of Persian and Arabic influences in Indian art forms, particularly music.  The introduction of new instruments, ragas (musical modes), and the patronage of music by various rulers are discussed.  The examples of Sultan Husain Sharqi and Raja Man Singh illustrate the extent of this cultural exchange and its impact on the development of Indian music.  This demonstrates the cross-cultural interaction and the creation of a unique artistic style.


**1. With reference to the economic conditions of the common people during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The staple diet of the ordinary people primarily consisted of rice, millet, pulses, and occasionally fish or meat, depending on the region.
2.  While food grains were relatively cheap, items like salt, sugar, and footwear were considered expensive, leading to a disparity in consumption patterns.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the economic realities faced by the common people in medieval India.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the staple diet as consisting primarily of readily available and affordable grains like rice, millet, and pulses. The inclusion of fish in coastal and Bengal regions and meat in the south showcases regional variations but doesn't contradict the overall affordability of the basic diet.  The text explicitly states that rice, millet, and pulses formed the staple diet, supplemented by regionally available protein sources.  This aligns with historical understanding of agrarian societies where grains formed the bulk of the diet.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text highlights the disparity in affordability. While food grains were relatively cheap, other necessities such as salt, sugar, and footwear were more expensive. This indicates a basic level of subsistence for the majority, where the focus was on calorie intake rather than a varied or luxurious diet.  The high cost of leather, as noted in the text by Moreland, further exemplifies the relative expense of footwear compared to food. This highlights the economic stratification within the society, where access to certain goods was limited by affordability, not just availability.  The contrast between cheap food and expensive non-food items is a crucial aspect of understanding the economic challenges faced by the common people.


**2. With reference to the housing and lifestyle of the rural population in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Villagers primarily resided in mud houses with minimal furniture, primarily consisting of cots and bamboo mats.
2.  The use of copper and bell-metal utensils was widespread amongst the poor, reflecting their economic prosperity.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the living conditions of the majority of the rural population.  The text explicitly mentions that villagers lived in mud houses with limited furniture, primarily cots and bamboo mats. This aligns with historical evidence suggesting that simple, basic housing was the norm for the rural poor across many historical periods.  The description of rudimentary furniture further reinforces the image of a simple, agrarian lifestyle.  The lack of elaborate furnishings underscores the prevalent poverty.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that copper and bell-metal plates and utensils were expensive and generally not used by the poor.  This directly contradicts the statement's assertion of widespread use amongst the poor.  The fact that these items were considered luxury goods highlights the economic disparities within the village society. The use of earthenware, being cheaper and readily available, was more common among the poorer segments of the population. The contrast between the expensive metal utensils and the commonly used earthenware is significant in understanding the economic stratification within the rural community.


**3. With reference to the social structure and inequalities in medieval Indian villages, consider the following statements:**

1.  The village society was characterized by significant inequality, with khudkashts (landowning peasants) often belonging to dominant castes who exploited weaker sections.
2.  Landless peasants and laborers, often belonging to “untouchable” castes, were the least affected by famines, demonstrating a degree of social resilience.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately captures the social hierarchy and inequalities prevalent in medieval Indian villages.  The text clearly describes a system where khudkashts, often belonging to dominant castes, owned and cultivated land, while exploiting landless peasants and laborers, many of whom belonged to lower or “untouchable” castes. This unequal distribution of resources and power is a well-documented feature of the social structure. The text explicitly mentions the exploitation of weaker sections by the dominant castes, highlighting the inherent inequalities within the village system.  This reinforces the understanding of a hierarchical society where social status directly correlated with economic and political power.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that it was the landless peasants and village artisans who suffered the most during famines. This directly contradicts the claim of social resilience and suggests that the most vulnerable sections of society were disproportionately impacted by such crises. The vulnerability of landless peasants and laborers to famines underscores their precarious economic position and lack of social safety nets.  The statement's assertion of resilience directly contradicts the reality of their suffering during famines.


**4. With reference to the agricultural practices and economic conditions during the 17th century in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian cultivator was resistant to change and adopted new crops only reluctantly, hindering agricultural progress.
2.  India possessed a diversified economy, cultivating a variety of crops including wheat, rice, and cash crops like cotton and indigo, and successfully exporting food grains.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly refutes the idea of the Indian cultivator being resistant to change. It highlights the willingness of cultivators to adopt new and profitable crops, citing the examples of tobacco and maize in the 17th century and later the potato and red chillies. This demonstrates adaptability and a response to market incentives, contradicting the statement's assertion of resistance to change. The adoption of new crops demonstrates the dynamism of Indian agriculture and the cultivator's responsiveness to economic opportunities.  The statement misrepresents the cultivator's attitude towards innovation.

Statement 2 is correct. The text describes India's economy as well-diversified, with the cultivation of a wide range of crops, including food grains (wheat, rice, gram, barley, pulses, bajra) and cash crops (cotton, indigo, sugarcane, oilseeds).  The ability to export food grains, particularly rice and sugar, further underscores the economic strength and efficiency of the agricultural sector. The diversification of crops and the capacity for export demonstrate the robustness and productivity of the Indian agricultural system during that period.  The text supports the statement's description of the economy's diversity and export capabilities.


**5. With reference to the Mughal nobility and their lifestyle, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal nobility lived in modest palaces and avoided ostentatious displays of wealth, reflecting a sense of social responsibility.
2.  The royal karkhanas (workshops) produced luxurious goods, including clothing and other articles of royal use, often made of imported materials like velvet and damask.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly indicates that the Mughal nobility, along with the sultans, enjoyed a lavish lifestyle marked by opulent palaces, costly apparel, and a large retinue of servants and slaves.  This contradicts the statement's assertion of modesty and social responsibility. The description of lavish feasts and festivals further underscores the ostentatious nature of their lifestyle.  The statement misrepresents the reality of the nobility's extravagant lifestyle.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions the existence of royal karkhanas that manufactured luxurious goods for the sultan and the nobility. These goods often incorporated imported materials such as velvet and damask, highlighting the access to and use of high-quality, often foreign, materials. The mention of a single pair of shoes costing 70,000 rankas illustrates the opulence and expense involved in producing these goods.  The statement accurately reflects the production of luxury goods within the royal workshops.


**6. With reference to the town life during the Sultanate period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Medieval towns had a homogeneous population consisting primarily of nobles and government officials.
2.  Slavery existed, with slaves acquired through various means, including war captives, and they were employed in various capacities, including domestic service and skilled labor.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text describes medieval towns as having a diverse population, including not only nobles and government officials but also a large number of artisans, shopkeepers, clerks, beggars, and slaves.  This diversity reflects the complex social and economic structure of the towns.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate picture of the town population.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly discusses the existence of slavery in medieval towns, outlining how slaves were acquired (war captives, purchase, inheritance) and how they were employed (domestic service, skilled labor).  This reflects the historical reality of slavery in many societies, including medieval India.  The detailed description of the different types of slaves and their roles supports the statement's accuracy.


**7. With reference to the agricultural reforms undertaken by Muhammad Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1.  Muhammad Tughlaq aimed to increase the state's share of land revenue by arbitrarily fixing it, leading to peasant rebellions and widespread hardship.
2.  The "diwan-i-amir-i-kohi" department, established to promote agricultural development, was highly successful in its goals, leading to significant improvements in cultivation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes one aspect of Muhammad Tughlaq's agricultural policies.  The text mentions that while the state's share remained at half the produce, it was fixed arbitrarily, without considering actual yields. This led to over-assessment, peasant unrest, and a severe crisis exacerbated by famine. The peasant rebellion and the sultan's harsh response to it are documented historical events. The text provides a detailed account of the flawed implementation and its consequences.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the "diwan-i-amir-i-kohi" department's scheme to improve cultivation failed primarily due to the inexperience and dishonesty of the officials involved, who misappropriated funds.  The scheme's failure, rather than success, is highlighted.  The text clearly indicates the failure of the department's initiatives, directly contradicting the statement's claim of success.


**8. With reference to the decline and disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate under Firuz Tughlaq and his successors, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Tughlaq successfully reasserted the Sultanate's authority over all previously lost territories, including south India and Bengal.
2.  Firuz's policy of making offices and iqtas hereditary, while initially appeasing the nobles, ultimately weakened the Sultanate by limiting the recruitment of competent individuals.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that Firuz Tughlaq did not attempt to regain control over south India and the Deccan, accepting their independence.  Furthermore, despite campaigns in Bengal, he failed to re-establish the Sultanate's rule there.  The text highlights the Sultanate's inability to reclaim lost territories under Firuz Tughlaq's reign.  The statement misrepresents Firuz's approach to territorial control.

Statement 2 accurately reflects a consequence of Firuz's policies.  The text describes how his policy of making offices and iqtas hereditary, while initially maintaining peace, ultimately led to a decline in the quality of governance and the recruitment of competent individuals outside a narrow circle of established families. This contributed to the weakening of the Sultanate in the long term. The text explains the long-term negative consequences of Firuz's policy, highlighting the limited pool of talent and the increased dependence on a select oligarchy.


**9. With reference to the changes in Indian society during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Brahman's position significantly weakened during this period, resulting in a decline in their influence and prestige.
2.  The rise of the Rajputs involved a complex process of social growth, including the legitimization of newly acquired power through genealogical claims and alliances with Brahmans.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text actually describes a considerable *strengthening* of the Brahman's position during this period, highlighting their increased influence in various fields like administration, education, and religious affairs.  The text mentions the granting of large revenue-free lands to Brahmans and their growing importance in various aspects of society.  The statement misrepresents the trajectory of Brahmanical influence.

Statement 2 correctly describes the multifaceted nature of Rajput emergence. The text explains how Rajputs legitimized their power through genealogical claims, often linking themselves to ancient Kshatriya families with the help of Brahmanical scholarship.  The text also discusses the "Rajputization" process, involving the colonization of tribal lands and the integration of various social groups.  The statement accurately reflects the complexities involved in the rise of the Rajput class.


**10. With reference to the overseas trade of India during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of long-distance trade within India led to a decline in the importance of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs) in north India.
2.  India's overseas trade focused primarily on the western areas, neglecting trade with Southeast Asia and China.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explains that the decline of long-distance trade within India, particularly in the north, led to a decline in the importance of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs).  These guilds, often inter-caste organizations, lost their significance as the volume of long-distance trade diminished.  The text specifically mentions the decline of guilds and their eventual transformation into sub-castes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text emphasizes the significant growth of India's overseas trade with Southeast Asia and China, highlighting the active participation of Indian traders from various regions (south India, Bengal, Gujarat) in these trade routes.  The text provides detailed accounts of the trade with both regions, including the commodities traded, the routes used, and the roles played by Indian traders and ships. The statement contradicts the text's description of extensive and thriving trade with Southeast Asia and China.


**1. With reference to the Pala Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dharmapala's rule extended to the furthest limits of India in the northwest, possibly encompassing Malwa and Berar.
2.  Devapala, Dharmapala's son, expanded Pala control over Pragjyotishpur (Assam), parts of Orissa, and possibly parts of modern Nepal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Pala Empire's expansion under Dharmapala and Devapala.  Statement 1 correctly notes the significant territorial reach achieved by Dharmapala, extending his influence far into northwest India.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of the Bhakti movement's rise and the philosophies of its key figures. Statement 1 correctly identifies the decline of Brahmanical authority after the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate as a contributing factor to the Bhakti movement's increasing popularity. This created a social and religious vacuum that the Bhakti movement effectively filled. Statement 2 correctly describes the focus of Kabir and Nanak, emphasizing their emphasis on individual spiritual transformation through devotion to a single God and their condemnation of caste discrimination. While their teachings had broader social implications, their primary focus remained on individual spiritual reform.

This showcases the movement's inclusivity and its adaptation of traditional elements. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while option (d) is incorrect as both statements are supported by historical accounts.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Vaisnavite branch of the Bhakti movement, its key figures, and its central themes.


**1. With reference to the Rajput period's literary landscape, consider the following statements:**

1.  Apabhramsha and Prakrit literature flourished alongside Sanskrit, reflecting the regional linguistic diversity.
2.  The famous Jain scholar Hemachandra primarily wrote in Sanskrit, contributing significantly to the period's Sanskrit literary output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajput period witnessed a vibrant literary scene where Sanskrit, Apabhramsha, and Prakrit coexisted.  While Sanskrit remained the language of the elite and courtly circles, Apabhramsha and Prakrit, closer to the spoken languages of the regions, allowed for wider literary expression and captured the cultural nuances of the populace. This linguistic diversity reflects a rich tapestry of cultural influences and the evolving literary traditions of the time.  The emergence of modern North Indian languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi from these popular languages further underscores the significance of this period's linguistic dynamism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Hemachandra, a prominent Jain scholar of the Rajput period, is known for his significant contributions to both Sanskrit and Apabhramsha literature. His works encompassed various fields, demonstrating his mastery over both the classical language (Sanskrit) and a vernacular language (Apabhramsha) that enabled him to reach a broader audience.  Therefore, the statement that he *primarily* wrote in Sanskrit is inaccurate; his contributions to Apabhramsha were equally, if not more, substantial.


**2. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in North India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghaznavids' initial interactions with the Rajputs were characterized solely by violent raids and plunder, resulting in continuous warfare.
2.  The Sufi preachers, arriving alongside Muslim traders, played a crucial role in initiating cultural and religious interaction between the Muslim and Hindu communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ghaznavids under Mahmud of Ghazni are infamous for their plundering raids, their interactions with the Rajputs weren't exclusively violent.  The text highlights a duality in their relations: alongside the raids, there was also a degree of peaceful coexistence, particularly with Muslim traders who were welcomed for their contributions to India's trade with Central and West Asia. This suggests a more nuanced relationship than simply continuous warfare.  The Rajput rulers, while resisting raids, also engaged in diplomacy and trade, indicating a complex interplay of conflict and cooperation.

Statement 2 is correct. The arrival of Sufi preachers alongside Muslim traders marks a significant turning point in the early interactions between the Muslim and Hindu communities. The Sufis, known for their emphasis on love, faith, and devotion to God, fostered a more peaceful and inclusive approach. While their primary audience was the Muslim settlers, their teachings influenced some Hindus as well, initiating a process of religious and cultural exchange that laid the groundwork for future interactions between the two communities.  This peaceful interaction contrasts with the primarily violent image often associated with the early Turkish conquests.


**3. With reference to the social structure of the post-Gupta period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The caste system remained rigidly fixed, with minimal social mobility or changes in caste hierarchies.
2.  The position of Dalits (untouchables) deteriorated during this period, characterized by increased social exclusion and discrimination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate portrayal of the caste system during the post-Gupta period. While the varna system provided a framework, the reality was far more fluid and complex.  The text explicitly states that caste was not as rigid as often believed; individuals and groups experienced social mobility, both upward and downward.  The emergence of new castes, like the Kayasthas, exemplifies this fluidity.  The integration of various groups, including Buddhists, Jains, and indigenous tribes, into the existing social structure further demonstrates the dynamic and evolving nature of the caste system.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly indicates a deterioration in the position of Dalits during this period.  They faced increased social exclusion, discrimination, and were subjected to degrading practices.  The descriptions of their forced segregation, restrictions on land ownership, and the symbolic acts meant to avoid contact with them clearly illustrate the worsening of their social standing.  This contrasts with the more nuanced picture of social mobility within other caste groups.


**4. With reference to the Rajput states and their political organization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajput system was characterized by a strong centralized authority, with the ruler possessing absolute control over his vassals.
2.  Internal feuds and rivalries among Rajput clans significantly hampered their ability to unite against external threats like the Ghaznavids.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Rajput rulers held considerable authority, the political structure wasn't one of absolute centralized control.  The system was based on clans, with each clan often dominating a specific territory.  The relationship between the ruler and his chiefs (often blood relatives) was complex, and while the ruler technically held ultimate authority, the sanctity of land and the power of the chiefs limited the ruler's ability to exert complete control.  The text highlights that while fiefs were technically held at the ruler's pleasure, their resumption was uncommon except under specific circumstances.  This points to a decentralized system with considerable autonomy for local chiefs.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text directly addresses the internal divisions and weaknesses within the Rajput states.  The emphasis on clan-based organization, along with frequent feuds and rivalries, significantly hindered their ability to present a unified front against external threats like the Ghaznavids.  These internal conflicts created opportunities for the Ghaznavids to exploit, preventing the Rajputs from effectively resisting the invasions.  The lack of a cohesive political structure among the Rajput states is a key factor in explaining their vulnerability.


**5. With reference to the cultural and religious developments during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's reign was characterized by strict religious orthodoxy and suppression of other faiths.
2.  The Bhakti movement and the rise of regional languages significantly influenced the literary output during this period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar's reign is renowned for its religious tolerance and syncretic policies, not for religious orthodoxy and suppression.  He actively promoted religious harmony and engaged in dialogues with scholars from various faiths.  The statement contradicts the well-established historical understanding of Akbar's religious policies, which were characterized by inclusivity and a conscious effort to bridge religious divides. This liberal approach is a stark contrast to the image of religious suppression presented in the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bhakti movement and the rise of regional languages profoundly impacted the literary landscape of the Mughal period.  The Bhakti poets' use of vernacular languages to express their devotional sentiments contributed to the growth and acceptance of these languages in literature.  The translation of religious texts like the Mahabharata and Ramayana into regional languages further expanded their reach and influence.  The flourishing of various literary traditions in languages like Bengali, Oriya, Hindi, Rajasthani, and Gujarati, showcasing themes from the Bhagavata Purana and devotional hymns, reflects the significant influence of both the Bhakti movement and the increasing prominence of regional languages.


**6. With reference to the economic and social life of the post-Gupta period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Long-distance trade within India flourished, leading to the growth and prosperity of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs).
2.  The condition of women remained largely unchanged, with continued social subordination and limited opportunities for education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates a decline in long-distance trade within India during the post-Gupta period. This decline led to the weakening of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs), which were previously important economic and social institutions.  The growth of local self-sufficiency and smaller towns catering to local trade overshadowed the importance of long-distance trade routes and the guilds associated with them.  The statement presents a direct contradiction to the described economic shifts.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text details the continued social subordination of women in the post-Gupta period.  Despite some evidence of skilled women in the arts and courts, their overall position was marked by limited educational opportunities and a patriarchal social structure.  The lowering of the marriageable age for girls and the lack of women teachers reflect this persistent inequality.  The description of women's duties and social expectations underscores the continuation of traditional gender roles and limitations on women's autonomy.  The statement accurately reflects the social reality depicted in the text.


**7. With reference to the overseas trade of India during the post-Gupta period, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's overseas trade was primarily confined to the west coast, with minimal interaction with Southeast Asia and China.
2.  Indian merchants played a crucial role in facilitating trade between China and countries in West Asia and Africa.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly details the extensive overseas trade network that India maintained during the post-Gupta period, encompassing not only the west coast but also significant interactions with Southeast Asia and China.  The descriptions of trade routes, port cities, and the involvement of Indian merchants in these far-reaching networks demonstrate the inaccuracy of the statement.  The statement ignores the crucial role of ports like Tamralipti in Bengal and the extensive maritime connections with Southeast Asia and China.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text highlights the crucial role played by Indian merchants in facilitating trade between China and countries in West Asia and Africa.  India's strategic location, coupled with its strong maritime traditions and skilled traders, made it a crucial intermediary in this extensive trade network.  The description of India's role as a staging center for trade, the involvement of Indian ships, and the mention of Indian traders' presence in far-flung ports like Canton (Kanfu) all underscore the accuracy of the statement.  The statement reflects the well-documented historical significance of Indian merchants in this global trade.


**8. With reference to the political situation in North India following the disintegration of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of Rajput states filled the power vacuum, leading to immediate political stability and a unified front against external threats.
2.  The weakening of the Pratihara empire allowed for the emergence of aggressive Turkish states on India's northwestern border.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The disintegration of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire did not lead to immediate political stability. Instead, it created a power vacuum that resulted in the rise of several Rajput states, each vying for dominance.  This fragmentation, rather than fostering unity, created internal conflicts and rivalries among the Rajput states, hindering their ability to effectively resist external threats.  The statement ignores the internal conflicts and power struggles that characterized this period.

Statement 2 is correct. The decline of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire, a significant power in North India, created an opportunity for the emergence of aggressive Turkish states on India's northwestern border.  The weakening of a major regional power left a strategic void that these ambitious Turkish states were able to exploit.  The text directly links the political instability resulting from the Pratihara empire's decline to the rise of these Turkish powers.  The statement accurately reflects the historical context and the causal relationship between the decline of a major power and the rise of new, aggressive forces.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. With reference to the socio-economic transformations in early medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The decline of long-distance trade led to the decline of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs) in North India, with some eventually evolving into sub-castes.
2.  Dharmashastras of the period encouraged extensive travel across India and overseas, reflecting the flourishing state of long-distance trade and cultural exchange.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that the decline of long-distance internal trade in North India resulted in the decline of trade guilds.  These guilds, often comprising members from different castes, lost their significance as their economic base eroded. Some of these guilds subsequently transformed into sub-castes, illustrating the complex interplay between economic and social structures. This demonstrates a key aspect of socio-economic change in early medieval India, where economic shifts directly impacted social organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text directly contradicts this statement.  It mentions a ban on travel beyond certain geographical limits in some Dharmashastras, suggesting a restriction on movement rather than encouragement. While Indian merchants, philosophers, and craftsmen did travel abroad, the Dharmashastras themselves did not advocate for widespread travel, especially for Brahmins, due to concerns about exposure to heretical religious ideas. This highlights the conservative undercurrents within the social structures of the time, even amidst overseas trade.  The existence of overseas trade does not negate the restrictive aspects of the Dharmashastras regarding travel.


**2. With reference to India's overseas trade in the early medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Manigraman and Nandesi guilds were primarily involved in inland trade within India, contributing significantly to the growth of small towns.
2. Tamralipti (Tamluk) served as a major port for trade with Southeast Asia, with merchants frequently embarking from there for destinations like Suvarnadvipa (modern Indonesia) and Kataha (Kedah in Malaya).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the Manigraman and Nandesi guilds were active in overseas trade with Southeast Asia, not primarily focused on inland trade. Their involvement in both wholesale and retail trade in foreign countries, along with their endowments to temples, indicates a broader economic reach than just internal trade.  The growth of small towns is mentioned as a separate development linked to increased local self-sufficiency, not directly attributed to these guilds.

Statement 2 is correct. The text specifically names Tamralipti (Tamluk) as the chief Indian port for voyages to Java, Sumatra, and other Southeast Asian destinations. It cites numerous accounts of merchants setting sail from this port to Suvarnadvipa and Kataha, underscoring its importance as a hub for overseas trade. This highlights the geographical reach of Indian trade networks and their connectivity with Southeast Asia during the early medieval period. The detailed description of the trade routes and the specific port's role makes this a strong and verifiable statement.


**3. With reference to the political landscape of North India in the early medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gurjara-Pratihara Empire's disintegration led to a period of political stability, allowing for the peaceful rise of various Rajput states.
2.  The Ghaznavid raids, while devastating in their immediate impact, ultimately strengthened the Rajput states by fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose against a common enemy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the break-up of the Gurjara-Pratihara Empire led to a phase of *political uncertainty* and struggle for domination in North India. The rise of Rajput states occurred amidst this instability, not in a period of peace. This highlights the chaotic nature of the post-Gurjara-Pratihara period and the competitive dynamics among emerging powers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Rajput states did resist the Ghaznavid raids, the text doesn't support the claim that these raids fostered unity among them.  Instead, the text emphasizes the internal rivalries and conflicts among the various Rajput states (Gahadavalas, Paramaras, Chauhans, etc.), which prevented them from effectively uniting against the Ghaznavids. This illustrates the limitations of the Rajput political structure and its inability to consolidate against external threats due to internal divisions. The Ghaznavid raids, therefore, did not result in a strengthened sense of Rajput unity, but rather exposed their internal weaknesses.


**4. With reference to the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud's seventeen raids into India were primarily aimed at annexing territory and establishing a lasting political presence in the Indo-Gangetic plain.
2.  The Somnath temple raid in 1025, while yielding immense wealth, ultimately proved to be a strategic blunder that weakened Mahmud's position and exposed his vulnerability to Rajput retaliation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text portrays Mahmud's raids as primarily aimed at plundering wealth from rich temples and towns, not at territorial annexation.  While he did expand Ghaznavid territory to the Jhelum River, his focus remained on the acquisition of wealth, which financed his campaigns against Central Asian adversaries.  The absence of any sustained effort to establish a lasting political presence in the Indo-Gangetic plain contradicts the assertion of territorial annexation as the primary objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text describes the Somnath raid as a highly successful plundering expedition that resulted in immense wealth for Mahmud. There is no mention of it being a strategic blunder that weakened his position.  While he faced some resistance and had to deal with Jats on his return, the raid itself is not depicted as a setback. The text doesn't suggest that the raid led to significant Rajput retaliation that impacted Mahmud's power. The emphasis is on the massive wealth acquired, not on any strategic miscalculation or lasting negative consequences.


**5. With reference to the cultural interactions during the early medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ban on sea travel mentioned in some Dharmashastras effectively halted India's flourishing overseas trade with Southeast Asia and China.
2. The spread of Indian culture to Southeast Asia was primarily facilitated by the activities of organized merchant guilds like the Manigraman and Nandesi, who also played a crucial role in disseminating religious ideas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly refutes this. While some Dharmashastras mentioned bans on sea travel, possibly targeted at Brahmins, the text points out that these bans did not impede the growth of India's overseas trade.  The continued flourishing of trade with Southeast Asia and China, involving Indian merchants and ships, demonstrates the ineffectiveness of these religious restrictions on economic activities.  The existence of the bans does not equal their success.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage highlights the significant role of the Manigraman and Nandesi guilds in facilitating the spread of Indian culture and religion to Southeast Asia. Their extensive trade activities, coupled with their financial support for temples and settlements of Indian traders in the region, led to the dissemination of both Hindu and Buddhist religious ideas. The mention of specific temples like Borobudur and Angkor Wat as evidence of this cultural exchange further supports this statement.  The direct link between merchant guilds and cultural diffusion makes this a strong and verifiable point.


**6. With reference to the economic conditions in early medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The high standard of Indian handicrafts, including textiles, gold and silver work, and metallurgy, experienced a sharp decline during the period.
2. While the ruling classes lived in opulence, a significant portion of the urban and rural populations faced widespread poverty and food insecurity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that there was *no decline* in the high standard of Indian handicrafts during this period.  Arab travelers' accounts corroborate the continued excellence of Indian craftsmanship. This underscores the resilience of traditional industries and their ability to maintain high standards of production despite political changes.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage contrasts the opulent lifestyles of the ruling classes (ministers, officials, feudal chiefs, and wealthy merchants) with the widespread poverty among the ordinary people – peasants, artisans, and laborers. The text details the hardships faced by these groups, including inadequate clothing, limited food options, and vulnerability to famines and wars.  This contrast highlights the significant economic inequality prevalent during this era.  The description of the stark difference in living standards between the elite and the masses makes this statement accurate.


**7. With reference to the Rajput political system, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajput society was characterized by a strict hierarchical structure with minimal internal conflict and strong centralized control under the ruler.
2. The Rajput clan system, while providing a sense of brotherhood, also contributed to internal feuds and hindered effective political unity against external threats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text portrays Rajput society as being based on a clan system, which, while fostering a sense of brotherhood, also led to significant internal conflicts and feuds.  The decentralized nature of power, with various clans and chiefs vying for influence, contrasts sharply with the idea of a strict hierarchical structure with strong centralized control. The description of the clan system and the resulting internal conflicts directly contradicts the assertion of a unified and hierarchical system.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage highlights the dual nature of the Rajput clan system. It provided a sense of brotherhood and egalitarianism among the Rajputs, but this same characteristic contributed to their internal feuds and conflicts.  This internal disunity significantly hampered their ability to present a united front against external threats like the Ghaznavids. The text specifically points out this inability to unite against a common enemy as a major weakness.  The acknowledgement of both the positive and negative aspects of the Rajput clan system makes this a nuanced and accurate statement.


**8. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate under Muhammad bin Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1. The transfer of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (Deogir) was a resounding success, effectively strengthening the Sultanate's control over South India.
2. The introduction of the token currency, although initially intended to address a silver shortage, ultimately failed due to widespread forgery and devaluation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes the transfer of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad as a major failure.  While initially intended to improve control over South India, the move caused widespread discontent, hardship, and ultimately, did not achieve its intended purpose. The Sultan's decision to return to Delhi after a short period underscores the failure of this ambitious undertaking. The text provides a detailed account of the negative consequences of this policy, making it clear that it was not a success.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explains that Muhammad bin Tughlaq's introduction of the token currency was an attempt to address a shortage of silver. However, the experiment failed due to the inability of the government to prevent widespread forgery of the new coins. This led to a rapid devaluation of the token currency, ultimately necessitating its withdrawal. The failure of the token currency is presented as a significant event with lasting repercussions, illustrating the Sultan's flawed economic policies.


**9. With reference to the agricultural policies of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's policies aimed at reducing the power of village headmen (khets and muqaddams) by directly involving them in cultivation.
2. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's agricultural reforms, while ambitious, ultimately failed due to poor planning, faulty implementation, and the impact of widespread famine.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that Muhammad Tughlaq *did not* believe in Alauddin Khalji's policy of reducing village headmen to the position of ordinary cultivators.  Alauddin's policies aimed to control the revenue system, not to directly involve the headmen in cultivation.  The description of Muhammad Tughlaq's contrasting approach clarifies the difference in their policies.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage attributes the failure of Muhammad bin Tughlaq's agricultural reforms to a combination of factors: poor planning, faulty implementation by inexperienced and dishonest officials, and the devastating impact of a prolonged famine.  These factors led to the failure of his attempts to improve and expand cultivation in the doab region. The detailed analysis of the reasons behind the failure of the reforms makes this statement accurate.  The mention of the famine and the misappropriation of funds are key factors to consider.


**10. With reference to the later Delhi Sultanate and its interaction with regional powers, consider the following statements:**

1. Firuz Tughlaq successfully reasserted Delhi's control over Bengal and South India after the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq.
2. The Gajapati dynasty of Orissa, known for its military prowess and building activities, engaged in conflicts with the Delhi Sultanate and other regional powers like the Vijayanagara Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that Firuz Tughlaq made *no attempt* to reassert Delhi's control over South India after the disintegration under Muhammad Tughlaq.  He also failed in his attempts to regain control over Bengal.  This indicates a shift in the Delhi Sultanate's power and influence, reflecting the weakening of its central authority.  The description of Firuz's inability to regain lost territories makes this statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage describes the Gajapati dynasty as a powerful force in Orissa, known for its military strength and significant building projects.  It also notes that the Gajapati rulers engaged in conflicts with the Delhi Sultanate and other regional powers like the Vijayanagara Empire.  This indicates the complex power dynamics of the region and the Gajapati dynasty's role in these conflicts. The mention of specific conflicts and the description of the Gajapati dynasty's capabilities makes this statement accurate.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and depends on the examinee's prior knowledge.  I have aimed for a challenging level by incorporating subtle distractors and requiring precise recall of details.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily focused on austere practices and formal worship, emphasizing ritualistic adherence to Vedic scriptures.
2.  The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, actively opposed the caste system and certain traditional Hindu practices like pilgrimages and sacrifices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement, in contrast to its characterization in the statement, actively rejected austere practices and formal, cold worship.  It emphasized a loving, personal bond between the devotee and God (Siva and Vishnu primarily), making it accessible to all castes. The movement's emphasis was on devotion and love, not rigid adherence to Vedic rituals.  The saints of the Bhakti movement actively used vernacular languages to spread their message, further demonstrating a departure from strict Vedic orthodoxy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lingayat or Virashaiva movement, founded by Basava and his nephew Channabasava, directly challenged the rigid caste system prevalent in society.  They rejected traditional Hindu practices such as elaborate pilgrimages, fasts, and sacrifices, advocating for a more egalitarian and simpler form of worship centered on Shiva.  Their social reforms included opposition to child marriage and allowance of widow remarriage, further highlighting their progressive stance.


**2. With reference to the religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dilwara Temple at Mount Abu is a prime example of the architectural grandeur achieved during the period of declining patronage of Jainism.
2.  The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola, depicting a Jain saint in rigid austerity, exemplifies the high watermark of Jainism in South India during the 9th and 10th centuries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dilwara Temple at Mount Abu stands as a testament to the flourishing patronage of Jainism, particularly by the Chalukyan rulers of Gujarat, *not* a period of decline.  Its magnificent architecture is a clear indication of the substantial resources and support available to Jain religious construction during that era.  The statement wrongly connects the temple's existence with a period of decline in Jain influence.

Statement 2 is correct. The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola, approximately 18 meters high, is indeed a remarkable example of Jain art and religious devotion. Its creation during the 9th and 10th centuries accurately reflects the peak of Jain influence in South India, where the Ganga rulers actively patronized the faith. The statue's depiction of the saint's unwavering austerity underscores the core tenets of Jain philosophy.


**3. With reference to the political developments in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghaznavid conquests of the Punjab initiated a consistent pattern of peaceful coexistence and cultural exchange between the Muslim and Hindu populations.
2.  The Ghurid conquest, culminating in the Second Battle of Tarain (1192), marked a significant turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ghaznavid raids under Mahmud of Ghazni, while involving some limited trade interactions, were primarily characterized by plunder and destruction of Hindu temples.  This created a pattern of conflict and animosity, not peaceful coexistence. The statement incorrectly presents a harmonious relationship between the two communities during this period of intense conflict. While some Muslim traders were present, the overall context was one of violent conflict and religious tension.

Statement 2 is correct. The Second Battle of Tarain (1192) is indeed a watershed moment in Indian history.  The decisive victory of the Ghurids under Muizzuddin Muhammad bin Sam over Prithviraj Chauhan paved the way for the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and the beginning of sustained Muslim rule in North India. This battle significantly altered the political landscape of the region and marked the beginning of a new era.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the reign of Sher Shah Suri:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's land revenue reforms were based on accurate land measurement and a fair assessment of agricultural productivity, laying the foundation for later reforms under Akbar.
2. Sher Shah Suri's religious policy was characterized by extreme religious intolerance and persecution of Hindus, reflected in the widespread destruction of Hindu temples.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sher Shah Suri's administration, particularly his land revenue reforms, was indeed a significant milestone in Indian history.  His reforms were based on precise land measurement (using standardized units) and a realistic assessment of agricultural yield, resulting in a more equitable and efficient revenue collection system. These reforms served as a model for later rulers like Akbar, who acknowledged and built upon Suri's achievements.  The statement accurately reflects the progressive nature of Suri's land reforms and their long-term impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Sher Shah Suri's reign wasn't marked by extreme religious tolerance,  the statement overstates his policy of religious intolerance.  While the *jizya* tax was continued,  and there were some instances of temple destruction, his overall policy wasn't one of systematic persecution.  The statement presents a distorted picture of his religious policy, which was more nuanced than portrayed.  He did patronize some Hindu officials and scholars, showcasing a more pragmatic approach than extreme bigotry.


**5. With reference to the socio-religious environment during the reign of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's policy of *sulh-i-kul* aimed at establishing religious harmony and tolerance by suppressing all religious practices except Islam.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, established by Akbar, was initially a space for discussions among Muslim theologians but later expanded to include representatives of various faiths.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar's policy of *sulh-i-kul*, meaning "peace to all," was precisely aimed at fostering religious harmony and tolerance, *not* suppressing other religions in favor of Islam.  While Akbar remained a Muslim, he actively promoted religious pluralism and refrained from imposing his faith on his subjects. The statement misrepresents the essence of *sulh-i-kul* by wrongly implying the suppression of other religious practices.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's Ibadat Khana, initially intended as a meeting place for Muslim scholars and theologians, evolved into a forum for interfaith dialogue.  Akbar's intention was to promote understanding and tolerance among different religious communities, reflecting his broader policy of religious harmony. The statement accurately captures the evolution of the Ibadat Khana from a purely Muslim space to an inclusive platform for religious discussions.


**6. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan, a prominent minister of the Bahmani kingdom, implemented significant administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs).
2.  The Bahmani kingdom's disintegration into five successor states was primarily caused by Mahmud Gawan's policies of religious intolerance and persecution of Hindus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms were indeed crucial in structuring the Bahmani kingdom.  His division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), with each under a tarafdar, and his efforts towards standardized revenue collection, significantly strengthened the kingdom's administrative framework.  The statement accurately highlights Gawan's contribution to the kingdom's administrative efficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bahmani kingdom's disintegration was primarily due to internal strife and power struggles among the nobility, particularly the conflict between the Deccanis and the foreigners (afrans or gharibs). While Mahmud Gawan's execution contributed to the instability, it wasn't the primary cause of the kingdom's fragmentation.  The statement incorrectly attributes the disintegration to Gawan's religious policies, neglecting the more significant factor of internal political conflicts.  The statement misrepresents the cause of the kingdom's decline.


**7.  Consider the following statements concerning the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Battle of Talikota (1565) marked the beginning of the Vijayanagara Empire's dominance in South India.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign is considered a golden age for Telugu literature, characterized by a shift from imitating Sanskrit works to producing independent Telugu works.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Battle of Talikota (1565) actually marked a catastrophic defeat for the Vijayanagara Empire, leading to its decline and eventual disintegration. It did not mark the *beginning* of its dominance but rather its devastating end. The statement misrepresents the historical significance of the battle.

Statement 2 is correct. Krishna Deva Raya's reign was indeed a golden age for Telugu literature. His patronage fostered a significant shift in Telugu literary production, moving away from mere imitation of Sanskrit works towards the creation of original and independent Telugu works. The statement accurately reflects this significant development in Telugu literature during his rule.


**8. With reference to the early Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's early reign was characterized by prolonged conflicts with the Uzbek nobles, who held significant power in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Malwa.
2.  The battle of Panipat (1556) resulted in a decisive victory for Hemu, solidifying Afghan control over North India and delaying Akbar's consolidation of power.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's early reign was indeed marked by significant challenges, notably the rebellions of the powerful Uzbek nobles. These nobles, who held considerable influence in key regions like eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Malwa, posed a serious threat to Akbar's authority.  The statement accurately reflects the difficulties faced by Akbar in consolidating his power during his early years.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The battle of Panipat (1556) actually resulted in a decisive Mughal victory under Bairam Khan, leading to the defeat and execution of Hemu. This victory was crucial in establishing Akbar's claim to the throne and beginning the process of consolidating Mughal power in North India. The statement misrepresents the outcome of the battle.  The statement gives the opposite outcome of the battle.


**9. With reference to the cultural developments in medieval Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah (1493-1519) is considered a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language and literature.
2.  The Muslim rulers of Bengal consistently succeeded in bringing the Brahmaputra valley under their control without facing major resistance from the Ahom kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign is indeed recognized as a golden age for Bengali literature.  His patronage of Bengali language and the flourishing of many notable Bengali writers during this period significantly contributed to the development of the language. The statement accurately reflects the linguistic and literary achievements of this era.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Muslim rulers of Bengal faced considerable resistance in their attempts to conquer the Brahmaputra valley. The Ahom kingdom, a powerful force in the region, repeatedly repelled the invasions from Bengal, preventing the complete subjugation of the Brahmaputra valley.  The statement incorrectly portrays the Muslim rulers' success in conquering the Ahoms.  The statement gives the opposite picture of the events.


**10.  Consider the following statements about the fifteenth-century political scenario in North India:**

1. The Rajput kingdoms of the fifteenth century maintained a consistent policy of complete isolation from the political events in South India.
2. The rise of powerful regional kingdoms in North India during the fifteenth century led to a period of both political instability and significant cultural contributions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The political dynamics of the fifteenth century show that the regional kingdoms of North India were not entirely isolated from the events in South India.  There were instances of interaction and even conflict between the kingdoms of North and South India, suggesting a degree of interconnectedness rather than complete isolation. The statement incorrectly portrays the complete isolation of North Indian kingdoms from South India.

Statement 2 is correct. The rise of several powerful regional kingdoms in North India during the fifteenth century did indeed create a scenario of political instability due to conflicts between these kingdoms. However, this period also saw significant cultural contributions in the form of local architectural styles, patronage of local languages and literature, and other cultural expressions. The statement accurately captures both the political instability and the cultural achievements of this era.


**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya I's attempts to regain territories lost to the Bahmani Sultans south of the Krishna River resulted in a stalemate, with existing frontiers remaining unchanged.
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire's naval power was substantial enough to consistently extract tribute from distant kingdoms like Pegu and Tenasserim.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Deva Raya I's military campaigns to recover Mudkal, Bankapur, and other territories south of the Krishna River, though involving fierce battles, ultimately concluded with an agreement to maintain the existing boundaries. This indicates a failure to achieve complete territorial reconquest, resulting in a status quo.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions that kings of Quilon, Sri Lanka, Pulicat, Pegu, and Tenasserim paid tribute to Deva Raya II, it immediately casts doubt on the regularity and extent of this tribute, particularly from Pegu and Tenasserim.  The suggestion is that these tributes might have been occasional gifts or diplomatic gestures rather than consistent payments enforced by significant naval dominance. The text highlights Sri Lanka's repeated invasions as evidence of naval strength, but doesn't support the claim of consistent tribute extraction from all mentioned kingdoms. The phrasing "It is doubtful whether the Vijayanagara rulers were powerful enough on thesea to extract regular tribute from Pegu and Tenasserim" directly contradicts this statement.  Therefore, the assertion of substantial and consistent naval power used for widespread tribute extraction is unfounded based on the provided text.


**2. With reference to the accounts of foreign travellers about Vijayanagara, consider the following statements:**

1. Nicolo Conti, in his account of Vijayanagara in 1420, described the city as having a circumference of sixty miles, a substantial army, and a king more powerful than any other in India.
2. Abdur Razzaq, visiting during Deva Raya II's reign, described Vijayanagara as possessing 300 ports equal to Calicut and vast territories requiring three months to traverse.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the accounts of foreign travellers as described in the text.  Statement 1 correctly summarizes Nicolo Conti's description of Vijayanagara's size, military strength, and the king's power.  The text explicitly supports these claims.

Statement 2 accurately reflects Abdur Razzaq's account, emphasizing the extensive number of ports and the vastness of Vijayanagara's land territories.  The text provides direct quotes corroborating these descriptions.  The hyperbole in the descriptions (60 miles circumference, 300 ports) does not invalidate their presence in the historical accounts. These accounts illustrate the immense scale and prosperity of the Vijayanagara Empire as perceived by contemporary foreign observers.


**3. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom under Firuz Shah Bahmani, consider the following statements:**

1. Firuz Shah Bahmani's administration saw a significant increase in the influence of Deccani Brahmins, especially within the revenue administration.
2. Firuz Shah Bahmani's primary focus was military expansion, neglecting cultural pursuits and administrative reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text clearly states that Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign witnessed a substantial rise in the participation of Deccani Brahmins in the administration, particularly in revenue matters. This was a deliberate policy of the Sultan to balance the influence of foreign elements within his kingdom.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text portrays Firuz Shah Bahmani as a ruler with diverse interests beyond military expansion.  He is described as knowledgeable in religious and natural sciences, a calligrapher, a poet, and a multilingual individual.  Furthermore, he actively encouraged learned individuals from various parts of the world, showcasing a commitment to cultural development. His establishment of an observatory near Daulatabad also demonstrates his interest in scientific pursuits, contradicting the statement's claim of neglect in these areas.  His administrative reforms are also mentioned, including his promotion of Hindus in his administration.  The statement misrepresents Firuz Shah's multifaceted reign.


**4. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the Chola Empire maintaining control over the island for over fifty years.
2. The Chola naval expeditions under Rajendra I primarily aimed at establishing cordial relations with the Srivijaya Empire, leading to the construction of a Buddhist monastery at Nagapatnam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the island remaining under Chola control for another 50 years. This demonstrates the lasting impact of Chola military success and their ability to maintain control over conquered territories.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions the existence of a Buddhist monastery at Nagapatnam and Rajendra I's involvement in its upkeep at the request of a Sailendra ruler, it also highlights that the Chola naval expeditions against the Srivijaya Empire were motivated by a desire to expand trade with China and remove obstacles for Indian traders, not primarily to foster friendly relations. The expeditions led to the conquest of Kadaram and other places, indicating a military rather than purely diplomatic objective. Therefore, the statement misrepresents the primary motives and outcomes of the Chola naval campaigns.


**5. With reference to the political dynamics of South India during the Chola period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola-Chalukya conflicts primarily revolved around control over Vengi, the Tungabhadra doab, and the Ganga-ruled region, without either side achieving a decisive victory.
2. The Chola rulers, despite their military conquests, implemented a system of local self-government in villages throughout their empire, promoting administrative efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text clearly describes prolonged conflicts between the Cholas and later Chalukyas centered on Vengi, the Tungabhadra doab, and northwestern Karnataka.  It explicitly states that neither side achieved a decisive victory, highlighting the protracted and indecisive nature of these conflicts.

Statement 2 is also correct. While acknowledging the brutality of some Chola conquests, the text emphasizes their efforts to establish sound administration in conquered territories.  A significant aspect of this administration was the encouragement of local self-government in villages through assemblies like the *ur* and the *sabha* or *mahasabha*.  This demonstrates a nuanced approach to governance, combining military might with a degree of decentralized administration.  The existence of these village assemblies is presented as a positive aspect of Chola rule, despite their harsh military actions elsewhere.


**6. With reference to the Rashtrakuta Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Govinda III's military campaigns extended Chola influence into the Ganga valley, resulting in the annexation of significant territories.
2.  Amoghavarsha I, though a ruler known for his patronage of literature and religious pursuits, faced numerous rebellions within his vast empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the text describes Govinda III's military successes against various southern kingdoms, including the Pallavas, Pandyas, and Cholas, it does *not* state that he extended Rashtrakuta (not Chola) influence into the Ganga valley or annexed territories there.  The text focuses on his southern campaigns. The statement confuses the Rashtrakutas with the Cholas.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that Amoghavarsha I's long reign, while marked by his patronage of arts and literature, was also characterized by numerous rebellions within his empire.  These rebellions highlight the challenges of maintaining control over a large and diverse territory, even for a ruler known for his cultural achievements.


**7. With reference to the Pratihara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pratihara Empire's loss of Gujarat significantly weakened its economic position, given Gujarat's role as a hub of overseas trade.
2.  Bhoja's military campaigns successfully expanded the Pratihara Empire's control over the entire Deccan plateau.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the loss of Gujarat, a major center for overseas trade, dealt a significant blow to the Pratihara Empire's economic strength. This highlights the crucial role of coastal trade in the empire's prosperity and the negative consequences of losing access to this trade route.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Bhoja is credited with significant territorial gains and the recovery of Kanauj, the text does *not* claim that he extended Pratihara control over the entire Deccan plateau.  His campaigns primarily focused on the north and central India, with some success in Malwa and parts of Gujarat, but the Deccan remained largely beyond his reach as he was checkmated by the Rashtrakutas.


**8. With reference to the cultural aspects of the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chola rulers extensively used temple inscriptions to record historical narratives of their victories, contributing significantly to our understanding of their history.
2.  The Dravida style of temple architecture, primarily associated with the Cholas, featured single-story structures with modest gopurams.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that Chola rulers inscribed their victories on temple walls, providing valuable historical information not readily available for their predecessors. This practice significantly enhances our understanding of Chola history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The description of Dravida architecture in the text clearly indicates that it involved multi-storied *vimanas* (towers above the sanctum), multiple courtyards, and elaborate *gopurams* (tower gateways).  The statement misrepresents the scale and complexity of Dravida temple architecture.  It presents a simplified and inaccurate picture of the architectural style.


**9. With reference to Mahmud of Ghazni's raids into India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's initial raids targeted the Hindushahi rulers of Peshawar and the Punjab, leading to a prolonged conflict.
2.  Mahmud of Ghazni's conquest of Somnath was primarily motivated by a desire to expand his empire eastward, leading to the establishment of a Ghaznavid province in Gujarat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly outlines Mahmud of Ghazni's initial focus on the Hindushahi rulers in Peshawar and the Punjab.  The ensuing conflicts are described as prolonged and involved multiple battles before the Hindushahi kingdom was effectively broken.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Mahmud of Ghazni's raid on Somnath was a significant event involving plunder of the temple's riches, the text does *not* support the claim that his primary motive was eastward territorial expansion or the establishment of a Ghaznavid province in Gujarat.  His raids were primarily focused on plunder and were not aimed at annexing territory. He did not establish any long-term administrative control in any of the regions he raided.  The statement misinterprets the nature and objectives of Mahmud's campaigns.


**10. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The administrative system under the Delhi Sultanate retained many aspects of the pre-existing local administrative structures, facilitating a relatively smooth transition of power.
2.  The economic condition of the peasantry during the Delhi Sultanate was uniformly poor, marked by widespread poverty and little variation in living standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly points out that the initial phase of the Delhi Sultanate saw minimal changes in local-level administration, with land revenue collection continuing largely as before.  This continuity helped the new rulers establish their authority more easily in the countryside.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text acknowledges the hardships faced by many peasants, including famines and wars. However, it also points to a more prosperous section of owner-cultivators,  smaller landlords, and Hindu rais who enjoyed higher living standards compared to ordinary peasants.  This highlights the economic stratification within the peasant class, contradicting the statement’s assertion of uniform poverty.  The statement oversimplifies the complex economic realities of the period.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Rajput rulers and their patronage of arts and letters, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vastupala, a minister under the Chalukya ruler Bhima in Gujarat, is renowned for his literary contributions and the construction of a significant Jain temple at Mount Abu.
2.  The Paramara capitals, Ujjain and Dhara, were prominent centers for Sanskrit learning, witnessing the creation of numerous literary works in Apabhramsha and Prakrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the historical record.  Vastupala, a prominent minister in Gujarat, was indeed a patron of learning and a significant figure in the construction of the Dilwara Jain temples at Mount Abu. His contributions extended beyond administration to include literary patronage.  Similarly, Ujjain and Dhara, under Paramara rule, were well-known centers for Sanskrit scholarship, fostering the creation of literary works in both Sanskrit and regional languages like Apabhramsha and Prakrit.  The flourishing of these languages reflects the cultural diversity and literary richness of the period.  There is substantial historical evidence supporting these facts, making both statements undeniably correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the documented historical roles of Vastupala and the importance of Ujjain and Dhara as centers of learning.


**2. With reference to the early interactions between Muslim and Hindu societies in North India after the Ghaznavid conquest, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initial interactions were primarily characterized by raids into the Gangetic valley and Rajputana, met with spirited resistance from Rajput rulers who achieved several victories against the Turks.
2.  Simultaneously, Muslim traders were welcomed, contributing to increased trade with Central and West Asia, and Sufi preachers fostered religious interaction, leading to the emergence of Lahore as a center for Arabic and Persian languages and literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly outlines two distinct, yet concurrent, patterns in the early Muslim-Hindu interactions.  Statement 1 accurately describes the initial wave of Ghaznavid raids, which, while destructive, also faced significant Rajput resistance, resulting in notable Rajput victories. This highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of the early interactions, characterized by both conflict and limited cooperation.  Statement 2 equally reflects the historical reality of the period.  The arrival of Muslim traders fostered economic ties with Central Asia, contributing to the prosperity of the region. The introduction of Sufi preachers, with their emphasis on tolerance, facilitated religious interaction and contributed to the cultural exchange that transformed Lahore into a hub for Arabic and Persian scholarship.  The coexistence of these two contrasting trends – conflict and cooperation – is crucial to understanding the early stages of the relationship between the two communities. Options (a), (b), and (d) provide an incomplete and inaccurate picture of this intricate historical period.


**3. With reference to the Battle of Tarain (1192), consider the following statements:**

1.  The battle is considered a turning point in Indian history, marking the beginning of large-scale Turkish conquest of North India, with Muizzuddin Muhammad employing a superior organized army against Prithviraj Chauhan's forces.
2.  Prithviraj Chauhan's failure to secure support from all North Indian rulers, particularly Jaichandra of Kanauj, significantly contributed to his defeat, despite commanding a numerically larger army.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Battle of Tarain (1192) is widely acknowledged as a pivotal moment in Indian history, representing a major shift in the political landscape. Statement 1 correctly highlights the strategic significance of this battle, emphasizing Muizzuddin Muhammad's superior military organization and tactics compared to Prithviraj Chauhan’s forces. The superior organization and the use of heavy cavalry and mounted archers proved decisive.  Statement 2 correctly points out the crucial role of inter-state politics. Prithviraj's failure to garner widespread support from other North Indian rulers, especially Jaichandra of Kanauj, weakened his position considerably, despite his numerical advantage.  The lack of a united front against the Ghurids allowed Muizzuddin to exploit the divisions within the Indian polity, contributing to his victory.  The combined effect of superior military strategy and political fragmentation underscores the importance of both statements in understanding the outcome of the battle. Options (a), (b), and (d) present incomplete and thus inaccurate interpretations of this significant historical event.


**4. With reference to the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1.  His controversial transfer of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (Deogir) aimed to better control South India, but ultimately failed due to the impractical distance and resulting discontent.
2.  The introduction of token currency, while innovative, was hampered by widespread forgery, leading to its devaluation and eventual withdrawal, negatively impacting the Sultan's prestige.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect significant aspects of Muhammad bin Tughlaq's reign, highlighting his ambitious yet ultimately flawed policies. Statement 1 correctly identifies the primary motivation behind the capital shift to Daulatabad – to improve control over South India. However, the vast distance between Delhi and Daulatabad proved insurmountable, causing significant administrative difficulties and widespread discontent among the populace.  The impracticality of the move ultimately led to its reversal.  Statement 2 accurately describes the disastrous implementation of the token currency. While conceptually advanced for its time, the inability of the government to curb widespread forgery rendered the new currency worthless, severely damaging the Sultan's credibility and highlighting the challenges of economic reform in a complex political environment. The failure of both policies highlights the complexities of governance and the limitations of even the most innovative policies without proper implementation and consideration of the practical realities.  Options (a), (b), and (d) offer incomplete and, therefore, incorrect interpretations of Muhammad bin Tughlaq's reign.


**5. With reference to the social and economic conditions during the reign of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  While food prices were generally low, significant poverty existed in urban areas, with disparities between the affluent and the impoverished segments of society clearly evident.
2.  The peasantry faced multiple burdens, including land revenue, additional cesses, forced labor, and the impact of frequent famines and wars, leading to a growth of what some historians term a feudal society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text paints a picture of contrasting realities within the Delhi Sultanate. Statement 1 correctly points out the existence of significant socioeconomic disparities. Despite the general availability of cheap food, urban poverty was a persistent issue, reflecting the unequal distribution of wealth and resources. This highlights the limitations of economic prosperity in reaching all sections of society.  Statement 2 accurately describes the plight of the peasantry.  The peasantry endured various forms of exploitation, including land revenue, multiple cesses, and forced labor.  The recurring famines and wars further exacerbated their suffering.  The rise of powerful regional lords who extracted surplus from the peasantry led some historians to describe this as a feudal system, though the exact parallels with European feudalism remain debated.  The combined effects of these factors created a complex social and economic landscape. Options (a), (b), and (d) fail to capture the full extent of the social and economic complexities of the period.


**6. With reference to the Rajput clans and their rise to power, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajputs are considered to have a mixed origin, with some scholars suggesting descent from various groups including foreigners like Shakas and Hunas, indigenous tribes, and even Brahmins.
2.  The process of "Rajputization" involved the growth of an agrarian economy, the acquisition of political power by certain sections, and the active role played by Brahmins in legitimizing their status through genealogical links to ancient Kshatriya families.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of Rajput origins and their rise to prominence.  Statement 1 accurately reflects the scholarly debate surrounding Rajput origins.  The lack of a single, clear lineage has led to multiple interpretations, with some historians pointing to a mixed ancestry encompassing various groups, including foreign invaders and indigenous populations.  This reflects the dynamic nature of social and ethnic formations in medieval India.  Statement 2 correctly describes the process of "Rajputization" as a complex social and political phenomenon.  The growth of agrarian economies, the acquisition of political power, and the significant role of Brahmins in legitimizing Rajput claims through genealogical connections to ancient Kshatriya lineages are all well-documented aspects of this process.  The interaction between different social groups and the resulting shifts in power dynamics are crucial to understanding the social transformations of the era. Options (a), (b), and (d) offer incomplete and inaccurate interpretations of the historical complexities surrounding the Rajput clans.


**7. With reference to the agricultural reforms undertaken by Muhammad Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1. Muhammad Tughlaq, unlike Alauddin Khalji, did not aim to reduce village headmen to the status of ordinary cultivators, but he sought to ensure an adequate share of land revenue for the state.
2. His schemes to extend and improve cultivation, while ultimately failing due to mismanagement and dishonesty, laid the groundwork for later agricultural reforms under rulers like Firuz Shah Tughlaq and Akbar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Muhammad Tughlaq's agricultural policies are notable for their ambition and ultimately, their failure.  Statement 1 accurately highlights a key difference between his approach and that of Alauddin Khalji.  While both aimed for increased state revenue, Tughlaq's methods did not involve the forceful demotion of village headmen.  His focus was on improving agricultural practices and increasing productivity to generate more revenue, a more nuanced approach than Khalji's.  Statement 2 correctly points to the long-term impact of Tughlaq's policies, despite their immediate failure.  Although plagued by corruption and mismanagement, his efforts to improve cultivation and introduce new crops laid the groundwork for future agricultural reforms undertaken by later rulers like Firuz Shah Tughlaq and Akbar.  His vision, even if poorly executed, influenced subsequent rulers' approaches to agriculture. Options (a), (b), and (d) present an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of the complexities of Tughlaq's agricultural policies and their lasting influence.



**8. With reference to the decline and disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reign of Muhammad Tughlaq, while representing the zenith of the Sultanate's power, also witnessed the beginning of its disintegration due to widespread rebellions and the weakening of central authority.
2.  Firuz Tughlaq, while aiming to prevent the Sultanate's collapse, adopted a policy of appeasement that ultimately strengthened the nobility and weakened the central administration, contributing to further decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The decline and fall of the Delhi Sultanate was a gradual process with multiple contributing factors. Statement 1 accurately reflects the contradictory nature of Muhammad Tughlaq's reign.  His reign marked the Sultanate's peak territorial expansion, yet his policies, particularly his ambitious but ill-conceived reforms, fueled widespread rebellions and significantly weakened the central government's authority. This laid the groundwork for the Sultanate's subsequent disintegration.  Statement 2 accurately describes Firuz Tughlaq's attempts at stabilization and their unintended consequences. His policy of appeasement, while maintaining a degree of peace, ultimately strengthened regional power bases and weakened the central government, accelerating the Sultanate's decline. His policies, while intended to consolidate power, inadvertently contributed to the further fragmentation of the empire.  Options (a), (b), and (d) provide an incomplete and, therefore, inaccurate understanding of the complex factors that led to the decline and eventual disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate.


**9.  With reference to Aurangzeb's reign and the various movements challenging Mughal authority, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jat uprisings, initially peasant rebellions, evolved into a movement for regional independence, culminating in the establishment of a separate Jat principality.
2.  The Afghan uprisings, driven by a combination of economic hardship, tribal sentiments, and religious revivalism, repeatedly challenged Mughal control in the northwest, significantly impacting Mughal strategy in the Deccan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aurangzeb's reign witnessed several significant challenges to Mughal authority, highlighting the complexities of governance in a vast and diverse empire. Statement 1 accurately traces the evolution of Jat uprisings.  What began as peasant revolts against economic hardship and Mughal policies gradually transformed into a movement for regional autonomy, ultimately leading to the establishment of an independent Jat state. This demonstrates the potential for localized resistance to evolve into larger political movements.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the multifaceted nature of Afghan uprisings.  Economic pressures, tribal loyalties, and the influence of religious revivalism all contributed to these repeated challenges to Mughal power in the northwest.  These uprisings not only disrupted Mughal control in a strategically important region but also significantly impacted Mughal military strategy in the Deccan, diverting resources and attention. Options (a), (b), and (d) offer incomplete and, therefore, inaccurate interpretations of the complex challenges posed by the Jats and Afghans to Aurangzeb's rule.


**10. With reference to Akbar's policies of integration and religious tolerance, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar abolished the jizya tax and pilgrim tax, demonstrating his commitment to religious equality and fostering a sense of inclusivity within his empire.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, while initially aimed at fostering interfaith dialogue, ultimately led to conflicts with orthodox theologians due to Akbar's perceived deviation from orthodox Islamic beliefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Akbar's reign is marked by his significant efforts towards religious tolerance and the integration of diverse communities. Statement 1 accurately reflects his commitment to religious equality.  The abolition of the jizya tax (poll tax on non-Muslims) and the pilgrim tax signaled a departure from traditional discriminatory practices and created a more inclusive environment within the empire.  This policy was a significant step towards promoting religious harmony and reducing social divisions. Statement 2 accurately describes the complexities of Akbar's religious policies and their unintended consequences.  The Ibadat Khana, although intended as a platform for interfaith dialogue and intellectual exchange, also led to significant friction with orthodox theologians who viewed Akbar's evolving religious views as heretical.  This highlights the inherent tensions between religious tolerance and maintaining the support of powerful religious establishments. Options (a), (b), and (d) offer an incomplete and, therefore, inaccurate understanding of Akbar's complex and nuanced religious policies.


**1. With reference to the reign of Sikandar Lodi, consider the following statements:**

1.  He executed a Brahman for asserting the equal sanctity of Hindu and Muslim scriptures.
2.  He initiated the translation of several Sanskrit works on music into Persian.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Sikandar Lodi's reign is marked by a complex religious policy. While he patronized scholars and fostered cultural exchange, he also displayed intolerance. The execution of a Brahman for claiming the equal sacredness of Hindu and Muslim scriptures highlights this aspect of his rule, reflecting the tensions and power dynamics between religious communities during his time. This act underscores the challenges in achieving religious harmony even amidst efforts towards cultural rapprochement.

Statement 2 is also correct. Sikandar Lodi's interest in music and culture led him to commission the translation of several Sanskrit works on music into Persian. This initiative reflects his patronage of learning and his attempts to bridge the cultural gap between Hindus and Muslims.  The translation of Sanskrit texts into Persian facilitated cultural exchange and the dissemination of knowledge across religious boundaries.  This reflects a broader trend of cultural interaction and exchange during the medieval period in India.  The translation efforts promoted mutual understanding and integration, although it coexisted with instances of religious intolerance.


**2. With reference to the cultural impact of the Mongol invasion of Kashmir in 1320, consider the following statements:**

1.  The invasion led to the widespread conversion of the lower-class population to Islam, partly through forceful means and partly through the influence of Sufi saints.
2.  The invasion resulted in the destruction of numerous Hindu temples and the melting down of idols to be used as currency under Sikandar Shah's rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Mongol invasion of Kashmir in 1320, led by Dalucha, significantly altered the religious landscape of the region.  The ensuing chaos and instability facilitated the influx of Muslim saints and refugees from Central Asia, furthering the spread of Islam.  The lower classes, already vulnerable, experienced conversions, a process accelerated by both missionary activities and coercion. The rise of Sufi Rishis, who blended aspects of Hinduism and Islam, also contributed to this religious transformation.  This highlights the complex interplay between political upheaval and religious change in medieval India.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The period following the Mongol invasion saw a drastic shift in religious policies under Sikandar Shah (1389-1413).  He implemented a policy of forced conversions targeting Brahmans and learned Hindus, demanding they either convert to Islam or leave Kashmir. The destruction of Hindu temples and the melting down of idols into currency were integral parts of this aggressive religious policy. This demonstrates the intense religious persecution experienced by the Hindu population and underscores the drastic impact of political changes on religious practices.


**3. With reference to the reign of Zainul Abidin of Kashmir, consider the following statements:**

1.  He ordered the restoration of Hindu temples and libraries, reversing the policies of religious persecution implemented by his predecessors.
2.  He commissioned the translation of Sanskrit works, including the Mahabharata and Kalhana's Rajatarangini, into Persian.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Zainul Abidin's reign marked a significant shift in Kashmir's religious policy. Unlike his predecessors, who had engaged in widespread persecution of Hindus, Zainul Abidin implemented a policy of religious tolerance.  He actively worked to reverse the damage caused by previous rulers, ordering the restoration of Hindu temples and libraries. This act of restoring religious institutions and cultural heritage demonstrates his commitment to religious reconciliation and the rebuilding of a more inclusive society. This stands in stark contrast to the religious intolerance of earlier rulers.

Statement 2 is also correct. Zainul Abidin's patronage of learning extended to both Sanskrit and Persian scholars. He actively supported the translation of significant Sanskrit works into Persian. This initiative included the translation of the epic Mahabharata and Kalhana's Rajatarangini, a crucial historical chronicle of Kashmir. This underscores his commitment to fostering intellectual and cultural exchange between different communities, promoting a more harmonious and unified kingdom.  This contrasts sharply with the destructive religious policies of previous rulers.


**4.  With reference to the cultural developments in India between 1300 and 1500, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque in Delhi was initially a temple that was converted into a mosque, while the Arhai Din ka Jhopra in Ajmer was initially a monastery.
2.  The Nagara style of temple architecture, characterized by tall, curved, spiral roofs over the garbhagriha, flourished primarily in north India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The early phase of the Delhi Sultanate witnessed the conversion of pre-existing structures into mosques.  The Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, a prominent example, was initially a Hindu temple, and its construction involved the repurposing of existing materials. Similarly, the Arhai Din ka Jhopra in Ajmer was originally a Jain monastery before being converted into a mosque. This illustrates the early interaction between Islamic and pre-existing religious structures in India.  The conversion of existing structures highlights the power dynamics and religious transitions of the era.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Nagara style of temple architecture, with its distinctive tall, curved, and spiral roofs over the sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha), is a significant feature of North Indian temple architecture.  This architectural style flourished between the 10th and 12th centuries, with prominent examples found in Khajuraho and Bhubaneshwar.  The Nagara style represents a high point of craftsmanship and artistic expression in Hindu temple building.  The prevalence of this style in North India underscores the region's rich artistic and architectural heritage.


**5. With reference to the Rajput states in the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chauhans of Ajmer, under Prithviraj III, successfully resisted the Ghurid invasion and maintained their dominance in the region.
2.  Rajput society was characterized by a clan-based structure, with each clan tracing its descent from a common ancestor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Prithviraj III, while a powerful ruler, ultimately failed to prevent the Ghurid conquest.  The Second Battle of Tarain (1192) resulted in a decisive Ghurid victory, marking a turning point in Indian history and leading to the decline of Chauhan power. The Ghurids subsequently expanded their influence over the Delhi area and beyond.  This shows the limitations of Rajput power in the face of the invading Turkish forces.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajput society was fundamentally organized around clans, with each clan tracing its lineage back to a common ancestor, real or mythical. This clan structure played a significant role in Rajput social and political organization.  The clan system influenced land distribution, power dynamics, and social hierarchies within Rajput states.  The strong emphasis on lineage and kinship ties shaped Rajput identity and social structures.


**6. With reference to the economic and social life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Khalji implemented price controls on essential commodities, resulting in relatively low prices for food grains during his reign.
2.  The introduction of token currency under Muhammad bin Tughlaq was a successful attempt to address the shortage of silver and improve the economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Alauddin Khalji's economic policies included price controls on essential commodities, notably food grains.  These measures, although controversial, did result in relatively low and stable prices for food during his reign.  These policies aimed to control inflation and ensure the availability of basic necessities to the population.  This reflects the Sultan's attempts to manage the economy and address social issues.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's introduction of token currency proved to be a major economic failure. The experiment, while intended to alleviate the shortage of precious metals, was plagued by widespread forgery and ultimately led to economic instability. The token currency's devaluation caused significant disruption to the economy and damaged the Sultan's credibility. This experiment highlights the challenges of implementing unconventional economic policies and the importance of considering practical implications.


**7. With reference to the Bahmani kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan, a prominent minister, implemented significant administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs).
2.  Following Mahmud Gawan's execution, the Bahmani kingdom disintegrated into five independent sultanates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mahmud Gawan, a highly influential minister in the Bahmani kingdom, implemented significant administrative reforms.  A key aspect of his reforms was the reorganization of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each governed by a tarafdar.  This administrative restructuring aimed to improve governance, enhance revenue collection, and strengthen central control.  This shows his focus on efficient administration.

Statement 2 is also correct. The execution of Mahmud Gawan, a key figure in maintaining stability, triggered a period of intense internal strife and factionalism within the Bahmani kingdom.  This ultimately led to its disintegration into five independent sultanates: Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Bidar.  The fragmentation of the Bahmani kingdom had significant long-term consequences for the political landscape of the Deccan.  This illustrates the fragility of centralized power in the face of internal conflicts.


**8. With reference to the Chola empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajendra I's naval expeditions extended Chola influence over parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
2.  The Chola administration included a system of village self-government, notably the sabha and ur assemblies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajendra Chola I significantly expanded Chola naval power and influence. His expeditions reached across the Bay of Bengal, extending Chola control and influence over parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  This demonstrates the Chola empire's maritime strength and its reach into Southeast Asia.  This expansion had a significant impact on trade routes and regional power dynamics.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Chola empire is known for its sophisticated administrative system, which included a considerable degree of local self-governance. Village assemblies, particularly the sabha (in Brahman villages) and the ur (in other villages), played a crucial role in managing local affairs.  These assemblies were responsible for various functions, including land management, tax collection, and maintaining law and order. This decentralized system of governance ensured efficiency and stability at the local level.  This system contrasts with more centralized administrative systems prevalent in other contemporary empires.


**9. With reference to the Vijayanagara empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign is considered a golden age, marked by military successes, administrative efficiency, and cultural flourishing.
2.  The Battle of Talikota (1565) marked the beginning of the decline of the Vijayanagara empire, although the kingdom continued for another century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Krishna Deva Raya's reign (1509-1530) is widely regarded as a high point in the Vijayanagara empire's history.  His rule was characterized by significant military victories, efficient administration, and a flourishing of Telugu literature and art.  His reign represents a period of stability, prosperity, and cultural achievements.  His military successes expanded the empire's territorial control and strengthened its position in South India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Battle of Talikota (1565) dealt a devastating blow to the Vijayanagara empire. While the kingdom did not immediately collapse, the battle marked a significant turning point, leading to a gradual decline in power and territorial control. Although the kingdom continued to exist for some time, it never regained its former strength or influence. The battle reflects the culmination of internal weaknesses and external pressures that ultimately led to the empire's downfall.


**1. With reference to the social dynamics of the early medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kayastha caste emerged as a distinct group, initially comprising individuals from various castes employed in royal establishments.
2.  The varna system remained rigidly fixed, with minimal social mobility between different varna groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The text explicitly states that the Kayastha caste originated from individuals across different varnas who served in royal administrations. Over time, they solidified into a distinct caste group, demonstrating a degree of social fluidity within the broader caste system. This highlights the complexities and dynamic nature of caste formation in early medieval India, challenging simplistic notions of a static hierarchy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text directly refutes this claim. It asserts that the caste system, while hierarchical, wasn't entirely rigid. Individuals and groups could experience upward or downward mobility within the varna system. The example of the Kayasthas further underscores this fluidity.  Moreover, the absorption of Buddhists, Jains, and various tribal groups into the Hindu fold led to the creation of new castes and sub-castes, further demonstrating the adaptable and evolving nature of the varna structure.  The text emphasizes the complexities of classifying new groups within the varna scale.


**2. With reference to the social status of different groups during the early medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Shudras experienced a gradual elevation in social standing, gaining eligibility for smarta rituals, despite restrictions on Vedic study.
2.  The Dalits (untouchables) saw an improvement in their social position, with reduced social discrimination and increased land ownership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions a "gradual elevation of the social position of the Shudras." Although barred from Vedic studies, they gained access to smarta rituals, signifying a degree of social advancement. This is significant because it shows a nuanced understanding of social mobility within the rigid caste structure.  The expansion of agriculture further contributed to this upward mobility, as many tribals were assimilated into the Shudra varna.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text presents a contrasting picture of the Dalits' situation. It states that their position "seems to have deteriorated" during this period. They faced continued social ostracism, were often restricted from land ownership, and endured practices like being forced to announce their presence to avoid contact with upper castes.  This points to a significant difference in social trajectory between the Shudras and the Dalits, highlighting the persistent inequalities and discrimination within the society.


**3. With reference to the practice of Sati during the early medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Smriti writers universally condemned the practice of Sati, emphasizing its incompatibility with righteous conduct.
2.  The practice of Sati was widespread, with some accounts even requiring the Sultan's permission for its performance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage indicates that Smriti writers held differing views on Sati. While some strongly approved of it, others allowed it under specific conditions. This demonstrates the lack of a unified stance within the religious texts themselves on the practice. The absence of a universal condemnation adds to the complexity of understanding its prevalence and acceptance in early medieval society.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text cites Ibn Battuta's account describing the practice of Sati and mentioning the need for the Sultan's permission, indicating its prevalence and integration, to some extent, within the existing socio-political framework.  This highlights the social and political aspects of the practice, extending beyond purely religious considerations. The fact that a foreign observer noted the need for official sanction indicates that Sati was not a purely private matter but had broader implications.


**4. With reference to the economic and social life of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed a flourishing urban economy, with significant growth in trade and the emergence of large cities like Delhi and Daulatabad.
2.  The majority of the population consisted of landowning peasant cultivators who enjoyed a high standard of living comparable to the urban elite.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text supports the assertion of a "flourishing urban economy" under the Delhi Sultanate, citing the growth of major cities like Delhi and Daulatabad as evidence.  The improvement in communication, a sound currency system, and the expansion of trade contributed to this urban prosperity.  The accounts of travelers further corroborate the existence of a vibrant commercial activity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clarifies that while some peasants were owner-cultivators and enjoyed a relatively better life, the vast majority lived at a subsistence level, facing hardships due to famines and wars.  The text contrasts the lives of prosperous owner-cultivators and village headmen with the struggles of ordinary peasants, highlighting the significant economic inequalities within rural society. The statement misrepresents the overall economic condition of the peasant population.


**5. With reference to the religious and cultural developments during the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah implemented a policy of religious tolerance, appointing Hindus to high positions in his administration, including his wazir.
2.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's military campaigns successfully extended the Sultanate's control over the entire Brahmaputra valley.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage describes Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign as a "brilliant period" characterized by a liberal policy towards Hindus.  It explicitly mentions the appointment of Hindus to key administrative positions, including the wazir (chief minister), physician, bodyguard chief, and mint master. This demonstrates a degree of religious tolerance and integration within the administration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that while previous rulers had attempted to conquer the Brahmaputra valley, they faced repeated defeats. Although Alauddin Hussain Shah did expand Bengal's territory by annexing Kamata, his campaigns against the Ahom kingdom in the eastern Brahmaputra valley were unsuccessful.  The text explicitly notes that an attack on the Ahoms was repulsed, indicating that the Sultanate's control did not extend to the entire valley.


**6. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire during the reign of Krishna Deva Raya, consider the following statements:**

1.  Krishna Deva Raya's military campaigns resulted in the complete subjugation of the Bahmani Sultanate and its successor states.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign witnessed a flourishing of Telugu literature, with a shift from Sanskrit imitation to independent works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Krishna Deva Raya significantly strengthened the Vijayanagara Empire through military victories against Bijapur and Orissa, he did not completely subjugate the Bahmani Sultanate or its successor states. The text mentions the continued existence and power of these states, highlighting the ongoing conflicts and power struggles in the Deccan region.  The statement overstates the extent of Krishna Deva Raya's military success.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage specifically credits Krishna Deva Raya's reign with ushering in a new era in Telugu literature, marked by a transition from imitating Sanskrit works to the creation of original Telugu literary pieces. This highlights the cultural flourishing under his patronage and the development of regional languages. The statement accurately reflects a key aspect of the cultural landscape during his rule.


**7. With reference to the political situation in the Deccan during the early 15th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bahmani kingdom under Firuz Shah Bahmani reached its zenith in terms of territorial extent and power, surpassing the Vijayanagara Empire.
2.  Firuz Shah Bahmani implemented a policy of religious tolerance, appointing Hindus to high positions within his administration and patronizing various faiths.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign was a period of significant expansion and consolidation for the Bahmani kingdom, the text explicitly states that the Vijayanagara Empire greatly exceeded the Bahmani kingdom in terms of power, wealth, and territorial extent. The statement incorrectly compares the relative strength of the two empires during this period.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage highlights Firuz Shah Bahmani's policy of religious tolerance, noting his appointment of Hindus to high administrative posts and his respect for various faiths. This demonstrates a significant aspect of his rule and its impact on the socio-political dynamics of the Deccan. The statement accurately reflects a key characteristic of his administration.


**8. With reference to the Rajput kingdoms and their interactions with the Turkish invaders, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajput rulers consistently defeated the Turkish invaders, preventing the establishment of Turkish rule in North India.
2.  The Ghaznavid conquests and subsequent raids into the Gangetic valley and Rajputana led to a pattern of both plunder and interaction between the Muslims and Hindus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rajput rulers offered spirited resistance and achieved victories against the Turkish invaders, particularly the Ghaznavids, they ultimately failed to prevent the establishment of Turkish rule in North India. The text clearly outlines the eventual success of the Ghurid conquests, marking a significant turning point in Indian history.  The statement misrepresents the overall outcome of the conflicts.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the dual nature of the early interactions between the Muslims and Hindus. The Ghaznavids engaged in both large-scale plunder and raids, alongside the development of trade relations and the establishment of Muslim trading communities and Sufi preachers in North India.  This demonstrates the complex and multifaceted nature of the early encounters between the two groups, encompassing both conflict and interaction.


**9. With reference to the administrative structure of the early medieval empires in India (Pala, Pratihara, Rashtrakuta), consider the following statements:**

1.  The position of the king was always strictly hereditary, with the eldest son automatically succeeding to the throne without any challenge.
2.  The empires maintained large and well-organized armies, with significant reliance on cavalry and war elephants, but without the use of war chariots.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the kingship was generally hereditary, the text notes instances where the eldest son faced challenges and was even deposed by younger brothers. This demonstrates that succession wasn't always automatic or uncontested, highlighting the dynamic nature of power struggles within these empires.  The statement presents an oversimplified view of the succession process.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage cites Arab travelers' accounts to support the existence of large and well-organized armies within the Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta empires.  These armies relied heavily on cavalry and war elephants, with no mention of war chariots, indicating a shift in military technology and tactics. The statement accurately reflects a key aspect of the military organization of these empires.


**10. With reference to the later Vijayanagara Empire and its disintegration, consider the following statements:**

1.  After the death of Krishna Deva Raya, the empire experienced a period of internal stability and continued military dominance in South India.
2.  The Battle of Talikota (1565) marked the effective end of the Vijayanagara Empire's political power, although the kingdom itself persisted for some time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Krishna Deva Raya's death led to a succession struggle and a period of internal conflict and weakening of the empire's power.  The statement ignores the significant internal strife and loss of authority that followed his death.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage identifies the Battle of Talikota as a pivotal event that marked the end of Vijayanagara's political dominance. While the kingdom continued to exist for a century after this battle, its power and territorial control significantly diminished, highlighting the battle's lasting impact on the political landscape of South India. The statement accurately reflects the historical significance of the battle.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule marked a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, with many famous Bengali writers flourishing during his reign.
2.  His liberal policies included appointing Hindus to high offices, such as wazir, chief physician, and master of the mint.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) was a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, fostering the work of several notable Bengali writers.  This directly supports statement 1.  Furthermore, the text highlights his liberal policies, citing the appointment of Hindus to key administrative and professional positions within his government. This confirms statement 2.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule in Bengal. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements, which are demonstrably true based on the provided historical account.


**2. With reference to the Ahom kingdom and its interactions with Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ahom kingdom, originally a Mongoloid tribe from North Burma, successfully resisted multiple attempts by Bengal's Muslim rulers to conquer them.
2.  The destruction of Kamata (Kamrup) and its annexation to Bengal occurred due to a joint attack by Alauddin Hussain Shah and the Ahoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage details the Ahom kingdom's successful resistance against the repeated attempts by Bengal's Muslim rulers, including those under Ilyas Shah and his successors, to expand their control into the Brahmaputra Valley.  The Ahoms, despite their initial non-Hindu origins, had become Hinduized by the time of this conflict, adding another layer of complexity to their interactions with the Muslim rulers of Bengal. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Alauddin Hussain Shah's attack did lead to the destruction of Kamata, it was *supported* by the Ahoms, not a joint attack.  The Ahoms were not attacking Kamata alongside Alauddin Hussain Shah; instead, their support facilitated the conquest.  This subtle but crucial difference makes statement 2 inaccurate.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to their misrepresentation of the historical events.


**3.  With reference to the architectural style prevalent during Ahmad Shah I's reign in Gujarat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahmad Shah I's reign saw the development of a unique architectural style in Gujarat, significantly influenced by the architectural traditions of the Jain community.
2.  The Jama Masjid in Ahmedabad and the Tin Darwaza exemplify the distinct features of this architectural style, characterized by slender turrets and intricate stone carvings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly describes Ahmad Shah I's significant contribution to Gujarat's architectural landscape.  He drew upon the rich architectural heritage of the Jains in Gujarat to create a distinctive style, separate from the architectural norms of Delhi. This directly supports statement 1. Statement 2 is also correct; the passage specifically names the Jama Masjid in Ahmedabad and the Tin Darwaza as prime examples showcasing the features of this unique architectural style, including slender turrets and highly ornate stone carvings.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the historical record concerning the architectural achievements of Ahmad Shah I's reign. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they don't fully capture the accuracy of both statements.


**4. With reference to the economic and social conditions in India during the early 17th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers consistently described a stark contrast between the opulence of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty among ordinary peasants and artisans.
2.  The staple diet of the common people primarily consisted of rice, wheat, millets, pulses, and vegetables, with regional variations in the inclusion of fish or meat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text directly supports both statements.  European accounts repeatedly highlighted the significant disparity between the lavish lifestyles of the ruling elites and the dire poverty experienced by the majority of the population, including peasants and artisans. This validates statement 1.  The passage also describes the common diet as consisting of rice, millets, pulses, and vegetables, with the addition of fish in coastal and Bengal regions and meat in the South. This accurately reflects statement 2. Thus, both statements accurately reflect aspects of the economic and social realities of early 17th-century India as described in the passage.  The remaining options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the validity of both statements.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Bhakti movement in South India:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Shiva and Vishnu, rejecting austere practices and emphasizing a loving bond between the devotee and God.
2.  The movement's saints, including both men and women, hailed from diverse social backgrounds, actively challenging caste inequalities and making the path of bhakti accessible to all.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly describes the Bhakti movement's focus on Shiva and Vishnu worship, its rejection of stringent ascetic practices, and its emphasis on a loving, personal relationship with the divine. This directly supports statement 1.  Moreover, the text highlights the participation of saints from various social strata, including lower castes and even women like Andal.  These saints actively challenged the rigid caste system, making the path of bhakti accessible to all, regardless of social standing. This confirms statement 2.  Therefore, both statements accurately represent key aspects of the South Indian Bhakti movement. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.


**6. With reference to the early Ghaznavid raids into India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's raids were primarily motivated by the desire to plunder wealth from rich temples and towns, rather than a sustained effort to establish permanent political control.
2. The Hindushahi rulers, who initially controlled Peshawar and the Punjab, received significant support from Rajput rulers in their resistance against Mahmud of Ghazni.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the historical record. Mahmud of Ghazni's seventeen raids into India were primarily focused on plundering the immense wealth accumulated in temples and prosperous cities.  While he certainly expanded his territory, his primary objective was acquiring riches rather than establishing a long-term, comprehensive political dominion over India.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the Hindushahi rulers fought virtually alone against Mahmud of Ghazni, receiving little to no support from Rajput rulers despite the later embellishments of some historical accounts.  The lack of significant Rajput support is a crucial detail that distinguishes this conflict.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are, therefore, incorrect because they misrepresent the historical context of the Ghaznavid raids.


**7. With reference to the administrative reforms undertaken during the reign of Mahmud Gawan in the Bahmani kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Gawan implemented a system of dividing the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each governed by a tarafdar, with fixed salaries and responsibilities for nobles.
2. He established a large madrasa in Bidar, which housed a significant number of scholars and students, attracting renowned scholars from Iran and Iraq.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly outlines Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms, including the division of the Bahmani kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each under the governance of a tarafdar.  He implemented a system of fixed salaries and responsibilities for nobles, aiming to streamline administration and enhance efficiency. This substantiates statement 1.  The passage also mentions the construction of a magnificent madrasa in Bidar, designed to accommodate a thousand teachers and students.  This madrasa attracted prominent scholars from Iran and Iraq, contributing to the intellectual and cultural development of the region.  This confirms statement 2. Therefore, both statements are accurate representations of Mahmud Gawan's administrative and cultural initiatives.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they only partially represent the historical information.


**8. With reference to the  Vijayanagara Empire during the reign of Krishna Deva Raya, consider the following statements:**

1. Krishna Deva Raya's military successes included reclaiming territories lost to Orissa and decisively defeating the Bijapur Sultanate in battle.
2.  Despite his military achievements, Krishna Deva Raya's reign witnessed a significant decline in Vijayanagara's naval power, leaving it vulnerable to the growing influence of the Portuguese.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage details Krishna Deva Raya's significant military victories.  He successfully regained territories previously seized by Orissa and achieved a decisive triumph over the Bijapur Sultanate, strengthening Vijayanagara's position in the south. This supports statement 1. However, the passage also notes that Krishna Deva Raya, unlike his predecessors, paid little attention to naval development, resulting in a weakening of Vijayanagara's naval capabilities and increased vulnerability to Portuguese influence. This validates statement 2. Thus, both statements accurately represent aspects of Krishna Deva Raya's reign. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.


**9. With reference to the social structure and caste system in India during the period circa 1000-1200 CE, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kayastha caste emerged during this period, encompassing individuals from diverse caste backgrounds who served in royal establishments.
2.  The position of Dalits, or untouchables, significantly improved during this period, with increased access to land ownership and participation in mainstream social life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the passage describes the emergence of the Kayastha caste during this period, comprising individuals from various caste backgrounds who worked within royal administrations. Over time, they consolidated into a distinct caste group.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage indicates that the position of Dalits, or untouchables, actually deteriorated, not improved, during this period.  They faced increased social exclusion, restrictions on land ownership, and other forms of discrimination. The contrast between the relative improvement in the Shudra caste's position and the worsening conditions for Dalits is a key aspect to understand the social dynamics of the time.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to their misrepresentation of the social dynamics of the time.


**10. With reference to Akbar's land revenue system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Zabt system, introduced by Akbar, involved a detailed measurement of land and assessment of revenue based on average produce and prices over the previous ten years.
2.  Akbar's land revenue system completely replaced all pre-existing local methods of assessment, establishing a uniform system throughout his empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Zabt system, a crucial element of Akbar's land revenue reforms.  It involved meticulous land measurement and revenue assessment based on average produce and prices calculated over a ten-year period (dahsala).  This system aimed for greater fairness and efficiency in revenue collection. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Zabt system was widely implemented, Akbar's land revenue system did *not* entirely replace all pre-existing local methods.  The passage mentions that other systems, such as batai and rasag, continued to be used in various regions.  The coexistence of different assessment methods highlights the complexity of implementing a uniform system across a vast and diverse empire. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to their misrepresentation of the historical facts.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the development of regional languages in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The decline in the prestige of Sanskrit contributed significantly to the rise of regional languages.
2. The Bhakti movement played a negligible role in the popularization of regional languages for literary purposes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that the loss of prestige by Brahmans led to a corresponding decline in Sanskrit's prestige, creating an environment conducive to the rise of regional languages.  This is a key factor in the shift towards vernacular literature. The weakening of the Brahmanical authority and the consequent decline in Sanskrit's dominance as a language of scholarship and administration opened up space for the growth of regional languages. This created a vacuum which was filled by the vernacular languages.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that the use of the common language by Bhakti saints was a crucial factor in the rise of regional languages.  These saints actively fashioned these languages for literary and religious purposes, significantly contributing to their development and wider acceptance.  The Bhakti movement's impact on the linguistic landscape was profound and far-reaching, making the statement factually inaccurate.  The use of vernacular languages by Bhakti saints enabled them to connect with a wider audience, thereby accelerating the growth and acceptance of these languages.  This made the regional languages more accessible to the masses and facilitated the development of a rich vernacular literature.


**2. With reference to the integration of musical traditions in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Amir Khusrau is credited with introducing several Perso-Arabic musical airs (ragas) but not the invention of the sitar.
2.  The tabla, often attributed to Amir Khusrau,  developed significantly during the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage acknowledges Amir Khusrau's introduction of numerous Perso-Arabic ragas, but explicitly states that the evidence for his invention of the sitar is lacking.  This highlights the importance of critically evaluating historical attributions and recognizing the limitations of available evidence.  The introduction of new musical forms and instruments reflects a process of cultural exchange and synthesis.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text clarifies that while the tabla is often attributed to Amir Khusrau, its significant development occurred much later, during the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century. This demonstrates the complexities of tracing the evolution of musical instruments and the inaccuracies that can arise from simplistic historical narratives. The passage carefully distinguishes between the initial introduction and the later development of the instrument.


**3. With reference to the patronage of arts and literature during the Medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nusrat Shah of Bengal patronized the translation of the Mahabharata and Ramayana into Bengali, and the Bhagavata into Bengali by Maladhar Basu.
2.  The Vijayanagara rulers significantly contributed to the development of Telugu literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions Nusrat Shah's patronage of the translation of major Sanskrit epics into Bengali, showcasing the role of rulers in promoting vernacular literature. This reflects the broader trend of regional languages gaining prominence during this period.  The translations highlight the process of cultural adaptation and the spread of literary traditions across different linguistic communities.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text directly states that Telugu literature flourished in South India under the patronage of the Vijayanagara rulers.  This exemplifies how regional kingdoms played a crucial role in fostering the development of local literary traditions.  The patronage of the Vijayanagara rulers signifies their investment in cultural development and their role in shaping the literary landscape of the region.  This demonstrates the importance of regional rulers in supporting and promoting artistic and literary development.


**4. With reference to the political and administrative structure of the Pala and Pratihara empires, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pala and Pratihara empires had a centralized administrative structure with minimal autonomy for vassal chiefs.
2.  The term "uparika" referred to the governor of a province, while "visayapati" designated the head of a district.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage describes the empires as consisting of both directly administered areas and those ruled by vassal chiefs who enjoyed considerable autonomy in their internal affairs.  This indicates a decentralized aspect to the administrative structure, contradicting the statement's assertion of complete centralization. The existence of vassal chiefs demonstrates a degree of decentralization and the limitations of central control.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly defines "uparika" and "visayapati" as the governors of provinces and districts, respectively.  This illustrates the hierarchical administrative framework of the empires.  The clear definition provided in the text eliminates any ambiguity regarding the roles of these officials.  The accurate identification of the administrative titles and their corresponding jurisdictions demonstrates a precise understanding of the empire's administrative structure.


**5. With reference to the social and economic conditions of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rate of revenue demand from peasants remained consistently at one-sixth of the produce throughout the period.
2.  The existence of additional cesses and forced labor significantly burdened the peasantry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the passage mentions the traditional one-sixth rate, it also points out the existence of numerous additional cesses levied on peasants, indicating a more complex and often higher tax burden than the stated one-sixth.  This highlights the need to consider the totality of tax burdens rather than focusing solely on a single, nominal rate. The existence of multiple taxes and levies complicates the picture of the peasant's tax burden.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly notes the presence of various additional cesses and forced labor (vishti), which, combined with land revenue, significantly increased the burdens on the peasantry. This illustrates the multifaceted nature of economic exploitation during the period and the limitations of focusing only on the base land revenue rate. The combination of multiple taxes and forced labor significantly increased the burden on the peasant community.


**6. With reference to the Rajput community in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajputs were exclusively of Kshatriya origin, tracing their lineage directly to ancient Kshatriya families.
2.  The Brahman-Rajput alliance played a significant role in the political and cultural landscape of Medieval India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clarifies that the origins of the Rajputs are complex and contested, with various theories suggesting mixed origins involving different social groups and even foreign elements.  This highlights the fluidity of social identities and the complexities of historical categorization.  The diverse origins of the Rajput community challenge the simplistic notion of their exclusively Kshatriya lineage.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the significant political and cultural consequences of the Brahman-Rajput alliance, emphasizing their collaborative role in shaping the period's dynamics.  This demonstrates the importance of inter-community alliances in shaping power structures and cultural expressions. The alliance between Brahmans and Rajputs had profound implications for the political and cultural landscape of Medieval India.


**7. With reference to the Ghaznavid raids into India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's raids were primarily aimed at consolidating political control over the Indian subcontinent.
2.  The Hindushahi rulers received significant support from Rajput rulers in their resistance against Mahmud of Ghazni.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage portrays Mahmud of Ghazni's raids as primarily focused on plundering wealth from temples and towns, rather than establishing lasting political control.  This contrasts with the image of Mahmud as a conqueror and highlights the limitations of characterizing his actions solely through a political lens.  The primary motive behind Mahmud's raids was the acquisition of wealth and not political control.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage indicates that the Hindushahi rulers largely fought alone against Mahmud of Ghazni, receiving minimal support from Rajput rulers. This highlights the fragmented nature of political alliances during the period and the strategic implications of this lack of unified resistance. The lack of Rajput support to the Hindushahi rulers demonstrates the lack of a unified front against the Ghaznavids.


**8. With reference to the social stratification in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The position of Shudras improved gradually during the period, with increased access to certain religious rituals.
2. The Dalits, or untouchables, experienced a significant elevation in their social status during this period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage notes a gradual elevation of the social position of Shudras, citing increased access to Smarta rituals. This illustrates the dynamic nature of the caste system and the potential for social mobility within its framework.  The gradual improvement in the social standing of Shudras demonstrates the evolving nature of the caste system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that the position of Dalits, or untouchables, deteriorated during this period, with their social exclusion and marginalization becoming more pronounced.  This highlights the persistence of social inequalities and the limitations of generalizing about social mobility across all caste groups. The worsening of the condition of Dalits demonstrates the persistence of social inequalities.


**9. With reference to the condition of women in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Women were universally denied the right to education and participation in public life.
2.  Widows were completely barred from inheriting property, regardless of circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the passage mentions restrictions on women's access to Vedic education, it also cites examples of women excelling in arts and literature, indicating a nuanced reality rather than a complete denial of educational opportunities for all women.  The existence of skilled and educated women in certain segments of society challenges the statement's sweeping generalization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that widows had property inheritance rights under certain conditions, such as the absence of sons. This indicates a more complex legal framework regarding women's property rights than a complete prohibition. The existence of conditional property inheritance rights for widows challenges the statement's absolute prohibition.


**10. With reference to the economic life of the common people in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The standard of living for the majority of the population was consistently high throughout the period.
2.  Famines and wars significantly impacted the living conditions of peasants and artisans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage contrasts the wealth of the ruling classes with the widespread poverty among peasants, artisans, and laborers, indicating significant variations and hardships faced by the majority.  The description of widespread poverty contradicts the statement's assertion of consistently high living standards.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions famines and wars as frequent occurrences that caused widespread destruction and suffering, impacting the living conditions of the common people.  This highlights the vulnerability of the peasantry and artisans to external shocks and the instability inherent in their economic circumstances.  The impact of famines and wars on the living conditions of the common people highlights the vulnerability of the peasantry and artisans.


**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's reign witnessed tributes from kings of Quilon, Sri Lanka, Pulicat, Pegu, and Tenasserim, indicating extensive Vijayanagara naval power.
2.  The Vijayanagara capital was described by Abdur Razzaq as a city with seven citadels and walls, each enclosing the other, showcasing its impressive fortifications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Deva Raya II's reign saw contact with the rulers of Quilon, Sri Lanka, Pulicat, Pegu, and Tenasserim,  the text itself questions whether the tributes received were regular or merely gifts and embassies seeking goodwill. The extent of Vijayanagara's naval power to enforce regular tribute from distant locations like Pegu and Tenasserim is debatable based on the provided information.  The text highlights Sri Lanka's repeated invasions, suggesting naval capacity but not necessarily the ability to extract consistent tribute across such a vast geographical area.

Statement 2 is correct. Abdur Razzaq's account vividly describes the Vijayanagara capital as a city featuring a concentric design of seven citadels and walls, each progressively larger than the last. This architectural description highlights the city's impressive scale, defensive strength, and sophisticated urban planning. This detail showcases the empire's power and resources invested in its capital's protection and grandeur.


**2. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign saw a significant increase in Hindu participation in the Deccan administration, particularly in revenue collection.
2. Mahmud Gawan, a prime minister of the Bahmani kingdom, significantly expanded the kingdom's territory by conquering western coastal areas, including Dabhol and Goa, thereby impacting Vijayanagara's trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Firuz Shah Bahmani's most remarkable step was the large-scale inclusion of Hindus in the administration, particularly within the revenue system. This policy is described as a deliberate move to establish the Deccan as a cultural center and balance the influence of foreign elements.  This highlights a nuanced aspect of Bahmani rule, showcasing religious tolerance and pragmatic administrative strategies.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Mahmud Gawan's administration is credited with expanding the Bahmani kingdom's reach, especially along the western coast.  The conquest of Dabhol and Goa is specifically mentioned as a significant achievement that dealt a severe blow to the Vijayanagara Empire's maritime trade and economic power. This demonstrates the strategic importance of coastal control and the impact of Bahmani expansion on regional power dynamics.


**3. With reference to the economic conditions in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed a flourishing urban economy, with major cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, Lahore, Multan, and Cambay showcasing significant commercial activity.
2.  During the Vijayanagara period, the peasantry's economic condition remained largely unchanged, with basic living standards and agricultural practices persisting despite the empire's overall prosperity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly describes the Delhi Sultanate as having a "flourishing urban economy," citing the growth of major cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, Lahore, Multan, and Cambay as evidence.  The text further supports this by mentioning the development of trade routes, currency systems, and the production of various goods, all contributing to a vibrant urban economic landscape.  This indicates a significant shift in economic activity towards urban centers during the Sultanate.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While the Vijayanagara Empire experienced significant overall prosperity, as described by various travelers, the text suggests that the economic condition of the peasantry remained relatively unchanged.  The description of their basic housing, clothing, and agricultural practices suggests a persistence of traditional lifestyles and economic structures, even as the empire's wealth and urban centers flourished. This highlights the disparity between the elite and the rural population during the Vijayanagara period.


**4.  With reference to the political dynamics of North India (8th-10th centuries CE), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pala Empire under Dharmapala briefly extended its influence to the furthest limits of northwest India, possibly including Malwa and Berar, indicating a significant expansion of its power.
2.  The Pratihara Empire under Bhoja, after recovering Kanauj, focused primarily on expansion eastward, achieving dominance over Magadha and North Bengal before its decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text mentions Dharmapala's reign as a period of significant Pala expansion, stating that his rule possibly extended to the furthest limits of northwest India, including areas like Malwa and Berar. This suggests a considerable increase in Pala influence and control over a vast territory in north India, though this expansion was ultimately short-lived.  The description highlights the dynamic nature of power struggles between major empires of the time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bhoja is described as a key figure in the Pratihara Empire's revival and expansion, the text highlights his focus on central India and the Deccan, along with conflicts against the Rashtrakutas.  While the text mentions later eastward expansion under Mahendrapala I (Bhoja's successor), it does not attribute this primarily to Bhoja himself. The statement misattributes the territorial expansion to the wrong ruler.


**5. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajendra I's naval expeditions against the Srivijaya Empire resulted in the conquest of Kadaram (Kedah) and other locations in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, showcasing the Chola navy's dominance in the Bay of Bengal.
2.  The Chola administration maintained a strong emphasis on village self-government, particularly in Brahman villages (agraharams), which enjoyed a significant degree of autonomy through assemblies like the sabha or mahasabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly details Rajendra I's naval campaigns against the Srivijaya Empire, emphasizing the Chola navy's strength and the conquest of Kadaram (Kedah) and other territories in Southeast Asia. This demonstrates the Chola Empire's maritime power and its reach beyond the Indian subcontinent, influencing trade routes and regional politics. The description highlights the Chola empire's naval prowess and its impact on regional power dynamics.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text specifically discusses the Chola emphasis on local self-government, particularly in Brahman villages known as agraharams. It details the functioning of village assemblies like the sabha or mahasabha, which had significant autonomy in managing village affairs, including land distribution, taxation, and infrastructure maintenance. This highlights the decentralized nature of Chola administration and its sophisticated mechanisms for local governance.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) was a "brilliant period" for the growth of the Bengali language, with many famous Bengali writers flourishing under his rule. This directly supports statement 1.  Furthermore, the text details his liberal policy towards Hindus, mentioning that his wazir, chief physician, chief bodyguard, and master of the mint were all Hindus. This clearly validates statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule in Bengal. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially represent the historical accuracy. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are supported by the provided historical information.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the socio-political dynamics of the period, highlighting the ruler's religious tolerance and its impact on cultural development.


**2. With reference to the political landscape of North-East India during the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah successfully conquered and annexed the Ahom kingdom to Bengal.
2.  The Kamata kingdom, located in western North Bengal, was destroyed and annexed to Bengal after an attack supported by the Ahoms.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text describes Alauddin Hussain Shah's military campaigns in North-East India. While he did attempt to conquer the Ahom kingdom, this campaign was unsuccessful and was repulsed.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. However, the text clearly states that Alauddin Hussain Shah's attack on Kamata (Kamrup), supported by the Ahoms, led to the destruction of Kamtapur and its annexation to Bengal. This directly confirms statement 2.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect. This question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful military ventures within a specific historical context, testing the examinee's understanding of regional power dynamics in medieval India.


**3. With reference to the religious policies of Alauddin Hussain Shah, consider the following statements:**

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions Alauddin Hussain Shah's respect for the Vaishnavite saint Chaitanya, directly supporting statement 1.  Furthermore, the text highlights the Sultan's policy of appointing Hindus to high offices, including his wazir, chief physician, and head of the bodyguard. This demonstrates a policy of religious tolerance and inclusion, confirming statement 2. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only address one aspect of the Sultan's religious policy. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are supported by the provided information. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of religious tolerance in a medieval context, going beyond simply stating tolerance to showcasing specific examples of its implementation.


**4.  With reference to the geographical extent of the Bengal Sultanate under Alauddin Hussain Shah, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chittagong and parts of Arakan were brought under the control of the Bengal Sultanate during his reign.
2.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's conquests extended the Bengal Sultanate's eastern boundary to the Brahmaputra River.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text states that Alauddin Hussain Shah conquered Chittagong from the Arakan king and also conquered Tipperah. This supports statement 1. However, although Alauddin Hussain Shah’s campaign against Kamata pushed the border further east, it did not reach the Brahmaputra River. The text clearly states that the Karatoya River was accepted as the northeastern boundary of Bengal, indicating that the eastern boundary of the Bengal Sultanate did not extend as far as the Brahmaputra River under his rule.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect based on this analysis. This question tests the candidate's ability to interpret geographical information within a historical context, requiring precise understanding of territorial boundaries and the limitations of military campaigns.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that Ahmad Shah I drew upon the rich architectural traditions of the Jains of Gujarat to create a style distinct from Delhi.  This makes statement 1 incorrect.  The text also cites the Jama Masjid in Ahmedabad and the Tin Darwaza as examples of the unique architectural style of his reign, characterized by slender turrets, exquisite stone carving, and ornate brackets. This directly supports statement 2.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of architectural history and the ability to identify stylistic influences and regional variations in medieval Indian architecture.


**6. With reference to Ahmad Shah I's religious policies in Gujarat (1411-1443), consider the following statements:**

1.  Despite ordering the destruction of Hindu temples at Sidhpur, Ahmad Shah I included Hindus in his government, with Manik Chand and Motichand serving as ministers.
2.  The imposition of jizya tax on Hindus during his reign was a significant departure from previous policies in Gujarat.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text describes Ahmad Shah I as a complex figure. While he ordered the destruction of Hindu temples at Sidhpur, the text also mentions that he appointed Hindus, specifically Manik Chand and Motichand, to ministerial positions within his government.  This supports statement 1.  The text further notes that Ahmad Shah I imposed the jizya tax on Hindus, a policy not previously implemented in Gujarat. This confirms statement 2.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of his religious policies. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not fully capture the complexities of his rule. This question challenges the candidate's ability to analyze seemingly contradictory information and understand the multifaceted nature of historical figures and their policies.


**7. With reference to the relationship between the kingdoms of Gujarat and Malwa, consider the following statements:**

1.  The kingdoms of Gujarat and Malwa were consistently allies, cooperating in military campaigns and political strategies.
2.  The rivalry between Gujarat and Malwa often involved attempts by one kingdom to influence or control the throne of the other.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly describes the bitter rivalry between Gujarat and Malwa, stating that they were generally found in opposing camps. This directly contradicts statement 1.  The text also details how both kingdoms attempted to weaken each other, including attempts by Gujarat to install its own nominee on the Malwa throne, and Malwa supporting disaffected elements in Gujarat. This directly supports statement 2.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect.  This question assesses the candidate's ability to understand inter-kingdom relations and the complexities of power dynamics in medieval India.


**8. With reference to Mahmud Begarha's reign in Gujarat (1459-1511), consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Begarha's reign was significantly shorter than that of Ahmad Shah I.
2.  Mahmud Begarha continued the expansionist policies of his predecessors.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text indicates that Mahmud Begarha ruled Gujarat for over 50 years (1459-1511), a longer reign than Ahmad Shah I's.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  However, the text states that Mahmud Begarha's successors continued Ahmad Shah I's policy of expansion and consolidation, suggesting that Mahmud Begarha himself also followed this policy, making statement 2 correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect. This question tests the candidate's ability to interpret information regarding the duration of rulers' reigns and to understand the continuity of policies across different rulers within a single kingdom.


**9. With reference to the Pala Empire's military organization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pala army consisted primarily of war chariots, reflecting a continuity with earlier military traditions.
2.  The Pala infantry included soldiers drawn from diverse regions across India, including Malwa, Khasa, Lata, and Karnataka.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that there is no reference to war chariots in the Pala army, indicating that they were no longer in use. This directly refutes statement 1.  The text, however, explicitly mentions that the Pala infantry consisted of soldiers from Malwa, Khasa (Assam), Lata (south Gujarat), and Karnataka, supporting statement 2.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect. This question tests the candidate's understanding of military organization in medieval India and the ability to identify the components of a diverse army.  The question highlights the multi-regional nature of the army, a key aspect of the Pala Empire's power.


**10. With reference to the administrative structure of the Pala and Pratihara empires, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pala and Pratihara empires had identical administrative divisions at all levels, from provinces to villages.
2.  The governors of provinces (uparikas) in the Pala and Pratihara empires were responsible for collecting land revenue and maintaining law and order.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While both empires shared some administrative similarities, the text indicates differences in their sub-unit divisions below the province level (e.g., visaya, bhukti, pargana).  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The text, however, consistently emphasizes the uparika's responsibility for collecting land revenue and maintaining law and order in their respective provinces in both empires. This validates statement 2.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect. This question tests the candidate's understanding of administrative structures and the ability to identify similarities and differences between two major medieval empires.  It also highlights the importance of regional variations even within similar administrative frameworks.


**11. With reference to the relationship between the state and religion during the Pala and Pratihara periods, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pala and Pratihara rulers actively persecuted religious minorities within their empires.
2.  Many rulers of this period made significant donations to religious institutions, irrespective of faith, demonstrating religious tolerance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the rulers generally gave patronage to all faiths and did not persecute anyone for their religious beliefs. This directly contradicts statement 1.  The text further emphasizes the rulers' generous donations to various religious institutions, including those of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and even mentions welcoming Muslim traders and allowing them to practice their faith. This clearly supports statement 2.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. This question tests the candidate's ability to discern the nature of religious policies and the extent of religious tolerance in medieval India, highlighting the complex interplay between political power and religious practices.


**12. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola navy played a crucial role in facilitating trade relations with Southeast Asia and China.
2.  The Chola navy's strength was primarily due to their reliance on superior shipbuilding techniques compared to their contemporaries.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions the Chola navy's role in strengthening economic, religious, and cultural relations with Southeast Asia and China.  This directly supports statement 1.  However, the text does not provide information about the Chola navy's shipbuilding techniques compared to contemporaries.  Therefore, statement 2 cannot be confirmed. Options (b), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the Chola Empire's maritime power and its impact on international relations.  It also highlights the importance of evaluating evidence carefully and avoiding assumptions based on limited information.


**13. With reference to the Chola Empire's expansion under Rajaraja I (985-1014) and Rajendra I (1014-1044), consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's conquests included the annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka and parts of the Ganga kingdom in Karnataka.
2.  Rajendra I's military campaigns resulted in the complete subjugation of the Chera and Pandya kingdoms.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that Rajaraja I conquered and annexed the northern part of Sri Lanka and parts of the Ganga kingdom. This directly supports statement 1.  The text also mentions that Rajendra I completed the conquest of Sri Lanka and completely overran the Pandya and Chera countries, incorporating them into his empire. This confirms statement 2.  Therefore, both statements are correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of Chola expansion and the achievements of specific rulers, requiring accurate recall of territorial gains.


**14. With reference to the political situation in North India following the decline of the Gupta Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pushyabhutis of Thanesar and the Maukharis of Kanauj were among the kingdoms that held power in Northern India after the Guptas.
2.  The Yadavas of Devagiri and the Maitrakas of Valabhi were minor regional powers with limited influence during this period.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text lists several kingdoms that held power in Northern India after the Guptas: the Guptas of Magadha, the Paramaras of Malwa, the Pushyabhutis of Thanesar, the Maukharis of Kanauj, the Yadavas of Devagiri, and the Maitrakas of Valabhi. The correct answer highlights the Pushyabhutis and Maukharis as significant players during this period, making statement 1 correct.  However, characterizing the Yadavas and Maitrakas as solely "minor regional powers" is an oversimplification. While their influence might not have been as extensive as others, they still held significant power within their territories.  Therefore, statement 2 is not entirely accurate.  Option (a) is the most accurate representation of the situation. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the relative power dynamics of these kingdoms. This question tests the candidate's ability to analyze complex political situations and assess the relative importance of different kingdoms during a transitional phase in Indian history.


**15. With reference to Akbar's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar divided the empire into twelve subas in 1580, each headed by a governor (subedar) and other key officials.
2. The "ghusal khana" initially served as Akbar's bathing apartment but later became known as a private consultation chamber for ministers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that Akbar divided his empire into twelve subas in 1580, each province having a subedar, diwan, bakhshi, sadr, qazi, and waqia-navis, thus directly supporting statement 1. It also describes how the private consultation chamber for ministers evolved from Akbar's bathing apartment, making statement 2 correct as well.  Therefore, both statements are accurate reflections of Akbar's administrative structure and practices. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of Akbar's administrative reforms and the evolution of his court practices. The question also assesses the understanding of the functional aspects of the administrative system.


**16. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's policy towards the Rajputs primarily relied on matrimonial alliances as a precondition for their acceptance of Mughal suzerainty.
2.  The abolition of the jizya tax in 1564 demonstrated Akbar's policy of broad religious toleration.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clarifies that while Akbar did utilize matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers, such as his marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bhara Mal, he did not insist on it as a precondition for accepting Mughal suzerainty.  The Hadas of Ranthambhor, for example, remained in Akbar's favor without matrimonial alliances. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The text, however, explicitly mentions Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax in 1564 as part of his policy of religious toleration, thereby supporting statement 2.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of Akbar's Rajput policy, highlighting the complexity of his approach and the importance of distinguishing between strategies and preconditions. The question tests the understanding of the policy and its impact.


**17. With reference to the Battle of Haldighati (1576), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Battle of Haldighati was primarily a conflict between Hindus and Muslims.
2.  Rana Pratap's forces at Haldighati included a significant Afghan contingent led by Hakim Khan Sur.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly refutes statement 1 by stating that the battle was not a struggle between Hindus and Muslims or Indians and foreigners.  The text clearly indicates that Rana Pratap's army included an Afghan contingent led by Hakim Khan Sur, directly supporting statement 2.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. This question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the participants and the nature of a significant historical battle, emphasizing the multi-ethnic composition of armies and the complexities of conflict.


**18. With reference to the literary and cultural patronage of Rajput rulers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajput rulers primarily patronized literature and art in vernacular languages, neglecting Sanskrit.
2.  Vastupala, a minister under the Chalukyan ruler Bhima in Gujarat, was known for his literary contributions and patronage of scholars.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly indicates that Rajput rulers patronized both Sanskrit and vernacular languages (Apabhramsha and Prakrit), refuting statement 1.  However, the text explicitly mentions Vastupala's role as a writer, patron of scholars, and builder of the Jain temple at Mount Abu, thus validating statement 2.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of cultural patronage in medieval India and the recognition of specific individuals and their contributions.


**19. With reference to the early interactions between Muslims and Hindus in North India after the Ghaznavid conquest, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghaznavid conquests were characterized solely by large-scale plunder and destruction, with no interaction between Muslim and Hindu communities.
2.  The establishment of Muslim trading colonies and the activities of Sufi preachers initiated a process of interaction between Islam and Hindu society.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly describes two distinct patterns of interaction: plundering raids and the presence of Muslim traders and Sufi preachers.  While Mahmud of Ghazni's raids were indeed characterized by plunder, the text also highlights the presence of Muslim traders, the growth of Muslim colonies, and the influence of Sufi preachers. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The text's description of Muslim traders, Sufi preachers, and the resulting interactions directly supports statement 2.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect. This question tests the candidate's ability to understand the complexities of early interactions between different communities and to avoid simplistic interpretations of historical events. The question assesses the ability to analyze different aspects of the interaction.


**20. With reference to the Battle of Tarain (1192), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid army's victory at Tarain was primarily due to its superior numerical strength compared to Prithviraj Chauhan's forces.
2.  Prithviraj Chauhan's appeal for help from other Rajput rulers was largely unsuccessful, with the exception of Jaichandra of Kanauj.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text attributes the Ghurid victory to the superior organization and tactics of their cavalry, not simply to superior numbers.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The text also states that while many Rajput rulers sent contingents to help Prithviraj Chauhan, Jaichandra of Kanauj did *not*, contradicting statement 2.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the factors contributing to the outcome of a crucial battle and the ability to differentiate between numerical superiority and strategic advantage.  It also highlights the importance of understanding alliances and rivalries among the Rajput kingdoms.


**1. With reference to the fiscal administration under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *muqti*, a provincial governor, was responsible for remitting the entire revenue collected to the central treasury, irrespective of local expenditures.
2.  Firuz Tughlaq is known for implementing stricter auditing procedures, including harsher punishments for *muqtis* found to be negligent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the *muqti* was required to remit the *balance* of the income after meeting local expenditures.  The system wasn't about remitting the entire revenue, but rather the surplus after accounting for provincial administrative costs. This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the Sultanate's fiscal policies, avoiding simplistic interpretations.  The question tests the candidate's ability to accurately interpret textual information and avoid generalizations.  Understanding the concept of a balance sheet and its application in historical contexts is crucial.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage indicates that Firuz Tughlaq *relaxed* the harsh auditing practices and punishments, not made them stricter. This highlights the need for precise recall of factual details. This subtle difference is a key component of a difficult UPSC question, aiming to differentiate between candidates with superficial and deep knowledge. The statement plays on the common misconception that all rulers of the Sultanate followed the same harsh administrative style.


**2. With reference to the village administration under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *pargana*, a sub-district unit, was invariably administered by a council of village elders, called the *chaurasi*.
2.  The *amil*, the head of the *pargana*, directly controlled the appointment and dismissal of village accountants (*patwari*).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the passage mentions villagers being grouped into units of 100 to 84 (called *chaurasi*), it doesn't state that this was the administrative structure of the *pargana*. The *chaurasi* system likely represented a social or tax-collection grouping, not necessarily a formal administrative council. The question tests the ability to differentiate between social structures and administrative units, a crucial skill in historical analysis. It highlights the importance of precise reading and avoiding assumptions based on incomplete information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage states that the *pargana* was headed by the *amil*, but it doesn't specify the *amil's* direct control over the appointment of *patwaris*. The village administration was likely left relatively autonomous as long as land revenue was paid.  The question highlights the fact that the passage lacks detailed information on specific administrative procedures, which is a common feature of historical sources. This forces candidates to infer accurately from available evidence rather than making assumptions.


**3. With reference to the economic life under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed information on the wages of unskilled laborers in various regions of the Sultanate.
2.  The cultivation of rice was largely confined to the northern plains, while wheat was the primary crop in the eastern and southern regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Ibn Battuta's account is mentioned as providing insights into the products and life of the people, the passage does not offer specific details on the wages of unskilled laborers. The question tests the candidate's ability to accurately assess the scope of information provided in a historical source, avoiding over-interpretation. It emphasizes the need for critical evaluation of historical evidence and its limitations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage states that rice and sugarcane were produced in the east and south, and wheat, oil-seeds, etc., in the north.  The question reverses the geographical distribution of crops to create a plausible but incorrect statement, testing recall and avoiding superficial understanding.  The candidate needs to accurately recall the geographical distribution of crops mentioned in the passage, differentiating between the north and the east/south.


**4. With reference to the social hierarchy under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *mugaddam* (village headman) and smaller landlords (*khet*) enjoyed a lower standard of living compared to ordinary peasants.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's policies significantly improved the standard of living for the majority of the peasantry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the *mugaddams* and *khets* enjoyed a *higher* standard of living than ordinary peasants, possessing more prosperous landholdings and privileges. This tests the candidate's ability to accurately interpret comparative statements within the text and avoid misinterpretations of social hierarchies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Alauddin Khalji's actions are mentioned as curtailing the privileges of prosperous landowners, the passage doesn't claim that his policies led to an overall improvement in the living standards of the majority of the peasantry.  The question assesses the candidate's capacity to understand the limited impact of specific policies on broader societal well-being, preventing overgeneralization.  The candidate needs to recall that while Khalji's actions targeted a specific group, it didn't necessarily benefit the majority of the peasantry.


**5. With reference to trade and industry during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cambay was primarily known for its production of raw silk and fine cotton cloth.
2.  The introduction of the spinning wheel significantly hampered the growth of the textile industry in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that Cambay was famous for textiles and gold and silver work, not raw silk and fine cotton cloth.  Sonargaon in Bengal is mentioned as the location famous for raw silk and muslin.  The question tests the candidate's ability to accurately recall specific details about the geographical distribution of industries and products, preventing confusion between different trade centers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage highlights that the introduction of the spinning wheel and cotton carder's bow *improved* the production of textiles, enhancing efficiency. The question introduces a counterfactual statement to test the candidate's understanding of technological advancements and their impact on the economy. The candidate must accurately recall the positive impact of the spinning wheel on the textile industry.


**6. With reference to the communication infrastructure under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Muhammad Tughlaq's road construction projects primarily focused on improving trade routes within the northern plains.
2.  The relay system for carrying messages relied solely on horseback riders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the passage mentions Muhammad Tughlaq building a road to Daulatabad, implying a focus beyond the northern plains, it doesn't state that his road construction was *primarily* focused on the northern plains. The question tests the candidate's ability to interpret the scope and limitations of information provided in the passage and avoid overgeneralizations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the relay system utilized both horses and runners, highlighting the efficiency of the system. The question aims to test the candidate's ability to accurately recall the details of the communication system, differentiating between the different modes of transportation used.  The candidate must understand that the passage provides multiple modes of transportation used in the relay system.


**7. With reference to the standard of living during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers consistently reported widespread prosperity and a high standard of living for the majority of the population.
2.  The staple diet of the ordinary people consisted primarily of meat and dairy products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage indicates that European travelers emphasized both the wealth of the ruling classes and the grinding poverty of ordinary people.  The question tests the candidate's ability to synthesize information from the text and avoid accepting a simplistic interpretation of historical accounts.  The passage presents a contrasting view of living standards, and the candidate must accurately reflect this contrast.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage mentions that rice, millet, and pulses formed the staple diet, along with fish in some areas. Meat was mentioned as being consumed in the South, but not as a staple diet for the majority.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details about diet and avoid generalizations based on limited information.  The candidate must accurately recall the staple food mentioned in the passage.


**8. With reference to the social structure during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *smriti* writers of the period advocated for the abolition of the caste system.
2.  The practice of *purdah* was primarily confined to the lower castes in Hindu society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that *smriti* writers continued to assign a high place to Brahmins, not advocating for the abolition of the caste system.  The question tests the candidate's ability to accurately interpret the role of religious texts in shaping social structures and avoid making assumptions about social reform movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the practice of *purdah* became widespread among the *upper-class* women, both Hindu and Muslim.  The question reverses the social class associated with *purdah* to create a misleading statement, testing the candidate's understanding of social customs and their association with different social strata.  The candidate must accurately recall the social class associated with purdah.


**9.  With reference to the nature of the state during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sultanate was characterized by a strict separation of religious and secular affairs.
2.  The *jizya* tax was consistently used as a tool to forcibly convert Hindus to Islam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the Sultans aimed to maintain an Islamic character, the passage demonstrates that religious divines did not dictate state policy.  Alauddin Khalji's statement about framing laws according to state needs shows a blending of religious and secular concerns. The question tests the candidate's ability to understand the complex relationship between religion and politics in the Sultanate, avoiding simplistic dichotomies.  The candidate must understand that the passage highlights a complex interplay between religious and secular aspects of governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage states that *jizya* could not be a means to force conversions and that the Sultans did not always enforce it strictly.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the limitations of the *jizya* tax as a tool for conversion and the nuances of religious policy in the Sultanate.  The candidate must accurately recall the passage's statement regarding the limitations of the jizya tax in forcing religious conversions.


**10. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms led to a significant weakening of the central government's authority.
2.  The Bahmani kingdom's disintegration resulted in the emergence of five independent sultanates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mahmud Gawan's reforms, including the division of the kingdom into provinces with fixed salaries and obligations for nobles, aimed to *strengthen* the central government, not weaken it. The question tests the candidate's ability to understand the aims and consequences of administrative reforms and avoid making assumptions about their impact.  The candidate must accurately understand the intent behind Mahmud Gawan's reforms.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly mentions that the Bahmani kingdom fragmented into five independent principalities: Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Bidar. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the political geography of the Deccan and the consequences of internal conflicts within the Bahmani kingdom.  The candidate needs to accurately recall the number and names of the successor states.


**1. With reference to the Mongol Empire in East Asia, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mongol conquest of China in the 13th century resulted in widespread death and destruction, but also led to the unification of north and south China under a single rule for the first time.
2.  The Mongol Empire's influence extended to Tonkin and Annam (Vietnam), Korea, and parts of Southeast Asia, creating one of the largest empires in East Asian history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mongol conquest of China, while brutal and causing immense suffering, was also historically significant for achieving the unprecedented unification of northern and southern China under a single rule.  Prior to the Mongol conquest, China had experienced periods of division and conflict between northern and southern dynasties. The Mongols, through their superior military organization and mobility, were able to overcome this long-standing division. This unification, while achieved through violence, had lasting consequences for the political and cultural landscape of China.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan and his successors expanded far beyond China.  Their vast empire included significant parts of Southeast Asia, encompassing Tonkin and Annam (modern-day Vietnam), and extended to Korea, showcasing the sheer scale of Mongol military power and territorial control. This vast empire constituted one of the largest contiguous land empires in East Asian history, impacting trade, culture, and political structures across a wide swathe of the continent.  The Mongol conquests fundamentally altered the political map of East Asia.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Mongol Empire's impact on East Asia. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are historically accurate.


**2. With reference to the maritime history of Southeast Asia, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sailendra dynasty, which established the Srivijaya Empire, controlled Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula, parts of Siam (Thailand), and even the Philippines, dominating sea trade to China.
2. The Pallava dynasty of South India also possessed a powerful navy, actively involved in trade within the Bay of Bengal, while the Chola dynasty undertook naval expeditions to Sumatra and Malaya to safeguard trade routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the extent and influence of the Srivijaya Empire under the Sailendra dynasty.  Srivijaya's maritime dominance extended across a vast archipelago, controlling key trade routes and strategically important islands.  Their naval power was crucial to their control over the lucrative spice trade and their interactions with China.  The empire's reach, encompassing Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula, parts of Siam, and even the Philippines, underlines its significant role in shaping the political and economic landscape of Southeast Asia.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the naval capabilities of the Pallava and Chola dynasties of South India. The Pallavas were known for their naval activity in the Bay of Bengal, facilitating trade and projecting their power.  The Cholas, particularly under Rajendra I, actively engaged in naval expeditions to Sumatra and Malaya, demonstrating their commitment to securing vital sea lanes and maintaining control over trade routes to Southeast Asia and China.  These naval expeditions showcase the Chola's significant maritime capabilities and their strategic interest in the region.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements present accurate information about the maritime history of Southeast Asia and the role of Indian dynasties. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are historically supported.


**3. With reference to the cultural exchange between India and Southeast Asia, consider the following statements:**

1. The magnificent temples of Borobudur in Java and Angkor Wat in Cambodia showcase the significant influence of Indian epics, such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata, on Southeast Asian art and architecture.
2.  Buddhism, having declined in India, flourished in Southeast Asia, assimilating Hindu gods into its fold and even adopting Hindu temples, creating a unique syncretic religious landscape.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Borobudur and Angkor Wat, two of the most impressive architectural marvels of Southeast Asia, prominently feature narratives and imagery from the Indian epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata.  This demonstrates the profound influence of Indian culture and religious beliefs on the artistic and architectural traditions of the region. The presence of these iconic stories in these grand temples highlights the deep cultural exchange between India and Southeast Asia.

Statement 2 is also correct. The decline of Buddhism in India stands in contrast to its continued flourishing in Southeast Asia.  In this region, Buddhism underwent a fascinating transformation, absorbing elements of Hinduism and incorporating Hindu deities into its pantheon.  The adoption of Hindu temples further exemplifies the syncretic nature of religious practices in Southeast Asia, creating a unique blend of Indian and local traditions.  This religious assimilation highlights the complex interplay of cultural influences in the region.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as both statements reflect accurately the significant cultural exchange between India and Southeast Asia. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are supported by historical evidence.


**4. With reference to the Mongol rule in China and its impact on global interactions, consider the following statements:**

1. Marco Polo's travels to the court of Kublai Khan and his subsequent return to Italy via Malabar, India, illustrate the increasing commercial and cultural contacts between different parts of the world during the Mongol period.
2. The development of a strong Chinese navy during the Mongol period led to expansionist policies in Southeast Asia, though most Southeast Asian states maintained their independence despite Chinese pressure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Marco Polo's account provides a firsthand glimpse into the interconnectedness of the world during the Mongol era. His journey to Kublai Khan's court in China and his return route through Malabar in India clearly demonstrates the expanding trade networks and increased interaction between disparate regions.  This illustrates the significant role of the Mongol Empire in facilitating global exchange and communication. The Mongol Pax, while not universally peaceful, did promote a period of relative stability that encouraged trade along the Silk Road and maritime routes.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Mongol period in China witnessed the development of a powerful Chinese navy. This naval strength, along with the expansionist ambitions of certain Chinese rulers, led to increased pressure on Southeast Asian states.  However, despite this pressure, most Southeast Asian kingdoms were able to maintain their independence, showcasing their resilience and strategic capabilities.  The existence of powerful kingdoms like Sailendra and Kambuja alongside Chinese influence highlights the complex political dynamics of the region.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as both statements are historically accurate and reflect important aspects of the Mongol period and its global impact. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are supported by evidence.


**5. With reference to the Kambuja and Sailendra empires in Southeast Asia, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kambuja Empire, flourishing until the 15th century, achieved a high level of cultural development, notably exemplified by the magnificent temple complex at Angkor Thom in Cambodia, including the large temple of Angkor Wat.
2. The Sailendra dynasty's Srivijaya Empire, which flourished until the 10th century, controlled a vast territory including Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula, parts of Siam, and even the Philippines, and was succeeded by the Majapahit Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately portrays the Kambuja Empire's cultural achievements and its longevity. The empire's influence extended over Cambodia and parts of Vietnam, and its impressive temple complexes at Angkor Thom, particularly Angkor Wat, stand as testaments to its advanced artistic and architectural skills and its enduring cultural legacy.  The scale and intricacy of Angkor Wat, with its extensive covered passages and depictions from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, showcase the sophistication of Kambuja culture.

Statement 2 correctly describes the extent of the Srivijaya Empire under the Sailendra dynasty and its succession. The Srivijaya Empire's maritime power and extensive control over key trade routes in Southeast Asia are well-documented.  Its vast territory, encompassing major islands and peninsulas, reflects its significant influence on the region.  The subsequent rise of the Majapahit Empire, which further expanded upon Srivijaya's territory, further demonstrates the region's dynamic political landscape.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements are accurate representations of the historical facts related to the Kambuja and Sailendra empires. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are supported by historical evidence.



**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya I's attempts to reclaim territories lost to the Bahmani Sultans south of the Krishna River resulted in a stalemate, with existing frontiers remaining unchanged.
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire's naval power was strong enough to consistently extract tribute from distant realms like Pegu and Tenasserim.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that Deva Raya I's military campaigns to recover Mudkal, Bankapur, and other territories south of the Krishna River, despite three hard-fought battles, concluded with an agreement to maintain the existing boundaries. This indicates a failure to significantly alter the territorial status quo.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions that kings of Quilon, Sri Lanka, Pulicat, Pegu, and Tenasserim paid tribute to Deva Raya II, it immediately casts doubt on the extent of Vijayanagara's naval dominance.  The text suggests that the tribute from Pegu and Tenasserim might have been symbolic gifts or embassies rather than consistent, enforced payments.  The invasion of Sri Lanka, cited as evidence of naval strength, does not prove consistent control over the vast distances and maritime power required for regular tribute extraction from Southeast Asian kingdoms.  The text highlights the uncertainty surrounding the nature of these tributes, implying a less powerful naval influence than statement 2 suggests.  Therefore, statement 2 presents a misleading interpretation of the source material.


**2. With reference to the reign of Firuz Shah Bahmani, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's administration was characterized by the widespread exclusion of Hindus, particularly from revenue administration.
2.  His reign witnessed a significant increase in the importance of the Deccan as a cultural center, attracting scholars from various parts of India and beyond.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that Firuz Shah Bahmani implemented a policy of including Hindus in the administration on a large scale, particularly in revenue administration.  This directly contradicts the claim of widespread exclusion. The text highlights this as a remarkable step, emphasizing the significant role of Deccani Brahmins in his government.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly describes Firuz Shah Bahmani's efforts to make the Deccan a cultural hub.  He actively encouraged learned individuals to migrate to the Deccan from Delhi (following its decline) and also welcomed scholars from Iran and Iraq.  His patronage of learning, and his stated policy of drawing learned individuals from various nations, firmly establishes the Deccan’s increased cultural prominence during his reign.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire's economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara kings were known for their frugal lifestyle and efficient management of state finances, eschewing the accumulation of large treasuries.
2.  Abdur Razzaq's account describes the Vijayanagara palace as containing numerous basins filled with bullion, reflecting the empire's immense wealth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage directly refutes this claim. It emphasizes the Vijayanagara kings' reputation for immense wealth, explicitly mentioning Abdur Razzaq's description of basins filled with bullion in the king's palace.  This depiction contradicts the idea of a frugal lifestyle and efficient financial management that avoids accumulating large treasuries. The text highlights the hoarding of wealth as an ancient tradition, but also acknowledges the potential risks associated with such practices.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly recounts Abdur Razzaq's observation of the Vijayanagara palace containing "several cell-like basins filled with bullion, forming one mass." This directly supports the statement and demonstrates the empire's significant wealth and accumulation of precious metals.


**4. With reference to the religious and social climate of 15th and 16th century North India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily appealed to the upper castes, reinforcing existing social hierarchies.
2.  Kabir and Nanak, while critical of existing social structures, primarily focused on individual spiritual reform rather than large-scale social change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Ramananda, a key figure in the Bhakti movement, taught his doctrine to all four varnas and disregarded caste restrictions on cooking and eating together.  He actively enrolled disciples from all castes, including the lowest, directly contradicting the assertion that the movement only appealed to the upper castes.  The movement's broad appeal across social strata is a central theme in the provided text.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage highlights that both Kabir and Nanak, while strongly criticizing the caste system and advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity, primarily focused their efforts on individual spiritual reform.  Although they denounced social inequalities, their main emphasis was on the transformation of the individual through the guidance of a true guru. The text distinguishes their focus on individual reform from that of a social reformer, emphasizing their spiritual message as the core of their teachings.


**5. With reference to the administrative structure of the Pala and Pratihara empires, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pala and Pratihara empires employed a highly centralized administrative system with minimal autonomy granted to vassal chiefs.
2.  The village constituted the fundamental administrative unit, with hereditary village headmen and accountants playing key roles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes the empires as consisting of directly administered areas and areas ruled by vassal chiefs who enjoyed considerable autonomy in their internal affairs.  While they owed loyalty and paid tribute, their internal governance was largely independent, contradicting the claim of a highly centralized system. The passage emphasizes the frequent wars between overlords and vassal chiefs, highlighting the limitations of central control.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly identifies the village as the basic administrative unit. It details the hereditary nature of the positions of village headmen and accountants, and their roles in village governance.  The passage further describes the functions and organization of village committees in the Rashtrakuta kingdom, reinforcing the importance of the village as a primary administrative unit.


**6. With reference to the Chola Empire's expansion, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola's conquests were primarily driven by a desire to control the spice trade routes through Southeast Asia.
2.  Rajendra Chola's reign witnessed the complete subjugation of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms and the annexation of all of Sri Lanka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja Chola's conquests did affect trade routes, the text does not state that this was the primary motivation. The text notes that his conquests aimed to bring trade with Southeast Asia under his control, but this is presented alongside other strategic and territorial goals, such as the destruction of the Chera navy and the conquest of Madurai and Sri Lanka.  The text does not prioritize trade as the sole or primary driving force behind his expansionist policies.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Rajendra Chola completed the conquest of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms, incorporating them into his empire.  It also mentions the complete conquest of Sri Lanka, with the capture of the Sri Lankan king and queen's regalia.  This supports the statement's claim of complete subjugation and annexation.


**7. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline in the prestige of Sanskrit was a major factor in the rise of regional languages.
2.  The patronage of Muslim rulers played a negligible role in the development of regional literatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text suggests that the decline in Brahmanical prestige, alongside the use of regional languages by Bhakti saints, contributed to the increased use and development of regional languages.  The text posits that Sanskrit’s prestige diminished, creating space for the growth of vernacular languages.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text provides examples of Muslim rulers actively patronizing regional literatures.  It mentions Nusrat Shah of Bengal commissioning translations of the Mahabharata and Ramayana into Bengali, and also highlights the patronage of regional poets by other rulers. This contradicts the claim of negligible Muslim involvement in the development of regional languages.


**8. With reference to the economic and social conditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers consistently reported a uniformly high standard of living across all social classes in India.
2.  The village economy was characterized by significant inequality, with landless laborers and artisans often facing harsh conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text directly contradicts this, noting that European travelers highlighted the stark contrast between the wealth of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty of ordinary people, including peasants, artisans, and laborers.  The descriptions of scanty clothing, lack of footwear, and simple housing for the majority of the population clearly show a disparity in living standards.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage emphasizes the significant economic inequality within villages. It describes the disparity between prosperous owner-cultivators and landless peasants and artisans, who often faced harsh conditions, especially during famines.  The text also highlights the exploitation of weaker sections by dominant castes and zamindars.  The description of the lives of landless peasants and laborers points directly to the significant inequality within the village economy.


**9. With reference to the Rashtrakuta Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rashtrakutas’ military campaigns consistently resulted in the expansion of their empire into the Ganga Valley.
2.  Amoghavarsha I, while a capable ruler, was primarily known for his patronage of arts and literature rather than military conquests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Rashtrakutas engaged in military campaigns against northern powers, the text explicitly states that their raids did not lead to the permanent expansion of their empire into the Ganga Valley.  Their conflicts with the Pratiharas were primarily focused on control of Gujarat and Malwa, not territorial conquest of the Ganga Valley.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage describes Amoghavarsha I as preferring religious and literary pursuits to warfare, highlighting his authorship of a Kannada book on poetics and his extensive building projects. While he faced rebellions during his reign, his primary focus is portrayed as being on cultural and infrastructural development rather than military expansion.


**10. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate's administration, consider the following statements:**

1.  The iqta system, initially implemented under the early Delhi Sultans, remained largely unchanged throughout the Sultanate's history.
2.  The village administration under the Delhi Sultanate saw significant changes from the pre-Turkish period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the iqta system underwent changes, particularly under Alauddin Khalji in the 14th century.  These changes led to conflicts and peasant rebellions, indicating a significant evolution of the system from its initial form. The text also notes that Firuz Tughlaq relaxed some of the harsher aspects of the system later in the Sultanate's history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage indicates that initially, the village administration remained largely unchanged under the early Delhi Sultans.  It was only with the reforms introduced by Alauddin Khalji that major changes were implemented, leading to conflicts and uprisings. The text notes that the early Sultans largely maintained the existing system to consolidate their rule, indicating a lack of significant changes in the initial phases.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's prior knowledge.


**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire's maritime activities, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's reign witnessed tributary relationships with kingdoms as far as Pegu and Tenasserim, indicating significant naval power.
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire's naval strength was crucial for its repeated invasions of Sri Lanka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. While accounts suggest contact and possibly gifts/embassies from Pegu and Tenasserim to Vijayanagara during Deva Raya II's reign,  the text itself questions the extent of Vijayanagara's ability to extract *regular* tribute from these distant locations. The statement overstates the evidence regarding consistent tributary relationships and naval dominance needed to enforce such tributes across such vast distances.  The accounts point more towards diplomatic ties and exchange of gifts rather than consistent tributary payments.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Sri Lanka being invaded multiple times, which necessitates a strong navy for such overseas military operations. This is a direct and verifiable fact from the text.  The logistical challenges of invading an island nation demand a significant naval capability.

Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the historical evidence presented concerning Vijayanagara's maritime power.


**2. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom's administration under Firuz Shah Bahmani, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's administration was characterized by a significant reduction in the influence of Deccani Brahmins in revenue administration.
2.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's multilingual abilities facilitated communication with his diverse wives and fostered a policy of inclusivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that from Firuz Shah Bahmani's time onwards, Deccani Brahmins became *dominant* in the administration, particularly in revenue collection. This directly contradicts the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage highlights Firuz Shah Bahmani's fluency in Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Telugu, Kannada, and Marathi.  His ability to communicate with his numerous wives, who hailed from diverse regions, underlines a policy of embracing cultural diversity within his court.  This demonstrates a degree of inclusivity in his approach to governance.

Thus, only statement 2 aligns with the information provided in the text.


**3. With reference to the political landscape of South India during the 15th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Krishna-Godavari basin was a consistent source of conflict between the Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani Kingdom.
2.  The annexation of Warangal by Ahmad Shah I shifted the Bahmani capital from Bidar to Gulbarga to consolidate control over newly acquired territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly indicates that the struggle for dominance over the Krishna-Godavari basin was an ongoing conflict between the Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani Kingdom, continuing even after major battles and shifts in power.  This was a key strategic region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that Ahmad Shah I shifted the Bahmani capital *from* Gulbarga *to* Bidar to better manage the newly acquired territories of Warangal. The statement reverses the direction of the capital shift.

Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**4.  With reference to Mahmud Gawan's contributions to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms included a division of the kingdom into eight provinces, each governed by a tarafdar, with fixed salaries and responsibilities for nobles.
2.  Mahmud Gawan's military achievements primarily focused on expanding Bahmani control over eastern territories, including Kanchi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text details Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each under a tarafdar, with standardized salaries and responsibilities for nobles, paid either in cash or through jagirs. This was a significant step towards administrative centralization.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While Mahmud Gawan did lead an expedition towards Kanchi, demonstrating Bahmani military strength, the text emphasizes his *major* military contribution was the conquest of western coastal areas, including Dabhol and Goa – a significant blow to Vijayanagara's trade.  The statement overemphasizes his eastern campaigns while minimizing his arguably more impactful western conquests.

Hence, only statement 1 accurately reflects Mahmud Gawan's accomplishments.


**5. With reference to the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The absence of a clear succession law following the death of Deva Raya II led to a series of civil wars and the weakening of the empire.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya's military victories against Bijapur and Orissa decisively ended the internal conflicts and secured the empire's long-term stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the lack of a primogeniture system in Vijayanagara after Deva Raya II's death resulted in succession disputes, civil wars, and the weakening of the empire. This is a direct and verifiable fact from the provided text.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Krishna Deva Raya did achieve significant military successes against Bijapur and Orissa, the text indicates that internal conflicts persisted even after his reign, ultimately culminating in the catastrophic Battle of Talikota.  The statement presents an overly optimistic and inaccurate portrayal of the empire's long-term stability after Krishna Deva Raya's military victories.

Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**6. With reference to Babur's early campaigns in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Babur's initial incursions into India were primarily motivated by the need to secure a refuge from Uzbek threats to Kabul.
2.  Daulat Khan Lodi's consistent support for Babur was instrumental in Babur's quick conquest of the Punjab.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text mentions Babur's meagre resources in Kabul and his apprehension of Uzbek attacks as key factors motivating his expansion into India, seeking a richer and more secure base of operations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Daulat Khan Lodi's support for Babur was inconsistent and opportunistic. While he initially invited Babur, he later changed sides, necessitating further military action by Babur to secure the Punjab. The statement inaccurately portrays Daulat Khan's actions as consistently supportive of Babur's conquest.


**7. With reference to the Battle of Panipat (1526), consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibrahim Lodi's army significantly outnumbered Babur's forces, but Babur's superior artillery and tactical deployment led to his victory.
2.  The Battle of Panipat marked the immediate and complete consolidation of Babur's rule across the entire Indian subcontinent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text indicates that Ibrahim Lodi had a much larger army, but Babur's strategic use of artillery, innovative battlefield tactics (the "Ottoman device"), and flanking maneuvers were decisive factors in his victory.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Battle of Panipat was a significant victory, the text explicitly states that Babur faced subsequent battles against Rana Sanga and other Afghan forces before consolidating his control over the region. The statement overstates the immediate and comprehensive nature of Babur's control after Panipat.


**8. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's policy of matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers was always a precondition for securing their allegiance and integrating them into the Mughal administration.
2.  The abolition of the jizya tax under Akbar was a significant step towards promoting religious harmony and consolidating his rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but needs clarification. While Akbar did use matrimonial alliances strategically, it wasn't an absolute precondition for securing Rajput allegiance.  The text mentions that some Rajput rulers, like the Hadas of Ranthambhor, remained loyal without such alliances.  The statement oversimplifies the complexity of Akbar's Rajput policy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax as a key element of his policy of religious tolerance, aimed at fostering harmony and strengthening his rule.


**9. With reference to the Chola Empire's military and naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajendra I's expedition to Bengal, crossing the Ganga river, led to the adoption of the title "Gangaikondachola."
2.  The Chola naval expeditions against the Srivijaya Empire were primarily motivated by a desire to establish Buddhist monasteries in Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that Rajendra I's successful campaign to Bengal, crossing the Ganga, resulted in his adoption of the title "Gangaikondachola."

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Cholas did have cordial relations with the Sailendra rulers of Srivijaya and even endowed a village for a Buddhist monastery, the primary motivation for their naval expeditions against Srivijaya was to expand trade routes to China and remove obstacles to Indian traders, not the establishment of Buddhist institutions. The statement misrepresents the primary cause of the conflict.


**10. With reference to the Rashtrakuta Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rashtrakutas' conflicts with the Pratiharas were primarily focused on control over the Ganga valley.
2.  Amoghavarsha I, known for his patronage of arts and literature, is credited with writing the first Kannada book on poetics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rashtrakutas and Pratiharas primarily clashed over control of Malwa and Gujarat, not the Ganga valley. While the Rashtrakutas did raid areas controlled by the Pratiharas, their main focus was the western regions.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly credits Amoghavarsha I with writing the first Kannada book on poetics, highlighting his contribution to Kannada literature.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**11. With reference to the Pala Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dharmapala's reign saw the Pala Empire extend its control to the furthest limits of India in the northwest, including Malwa and Berar.
2.  The Pala rulers, while primarily patrons of Buddhism, also extended patronage to Saivism and Vaishnavism, evidenced by grants to Brahmins.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an overstatement. While Dharmapala's reign was a period of expansion for the Pala Empire, the text suggests that the extent of his control to the "furthest limits of India in the northwest" is a matter of interpretation and likely an exaggeration of his influence.  It is unlikely that Malwa and Berar were under direct Pala control.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the Pala rulers’ patronage of both Buddhism and other faiths like Saivism and Vaishnavism, supported by grants to Brahmins. This demonstrates their religious tolerance.


**12. With reference to the political and cultural interactions between the various kingdoms of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The continuous struggles between the Rajput rulers in north India aided the Turkish conquest by preventing a united front against them.
2. The cultural traditions of the Bahmani Kingdom were completely independent of the cultural influences of north India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the internal conflicts among Rajput rulers facilitated the Turkish expansion into India by hindering the formation of a unified Rajput resistance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the Bahmani Kingdom acted as a cultural bridge between north and south India, resulting in a unique cultural blend.  The statement misrepresents the historical reality of cultural exchange and interaction.


**1. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule witnessed a significant period of growth for the Bengali language, with many famous Bengali writers flourishing during his reign.
2.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's conquest of Kamata led to the annexation of the kingdom to Bengal and the appointment of one of his sons as governor of the newly acquired territory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule in Bengal.  Statement 1 correctly identifies his reign as a crucial period for the development and flourishing of the Bengali language and literature.  The text explicitly states that his rule marked a "significant period for the growth of the Bengali language" and that "some of the famous Bengali writers of the time flourished under his rule." This highlights the cultural impact of his administration.  Statement 2 is also accurate in describing his military success against Kamata (Kamrup). The text details how Alauddin Hussain Shah, with Ahom support, conquered Kamata, leading to its annexation and the appointment of one of his sons as governor, demonstrating his expansionist policies and administrative strategies. Therefore, both statements are historically supported by the provided text.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to account for the accuracy of both statements concerning Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign.


**2. With reference to the socio-political dynamics of 15th-16th century Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ahom kingdom, originally a Mongoloid tribe from North Burma, had become Hinduized by the 15th century and engaged in conflicts with the Bengal Sultanate.
2.  The Bengal Sultanate's attempts to control the Brahmaputra valley consistently resulted in disastrous defeats before Alauddin Hussain Shah's successful campaign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text supports both statements. Statement 1 accurately describes the Ahom kingdom's origins, its Hinduization, and its involvement in conflicts with the Bengal Sultanate. The text explicitly mentions the Ahoms as a "Mongoloid tribe from north Burma" who had "become Hinduized in course of time" and were one of two warring kingdoms in the region alongside Kamata, directly engaging with the Bengal Sultanate. Statement 2 also reflects the historical reality presented. The text clearly states that Muslim rulers of Bengal had faced "a series of disastrous defeats" in the Brahmaputra valley before Alauddin Hussain Shah's successful campaign, highlighting the challenges faced in controlling this region. Therefore, (c) is the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly omit either the Ahom kingdom's history and conflict or the Bengal Sultanate's repeated failures in the Brahmaputra valley, respectively.


**3. With reference to the religious policies of Alauddin Hussain Shah, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Hussain Shah, despite being a Muslim ruler, appointed several Hindus to high positions in his administration, including his wazir, chief physician, and chief of the bodyguard.
2. Alauddin Hussain Shah is known to have shown great respect for the famous Vaishnavite saint Chaitanya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage directly supports both assertions about Alauddin Hussain Shah's religious policies. Statement 1 accurately describes his inclusive approach to governance by highlighting the appointment of Hindus to key administrative roles. The text explicitly mentions that he "adopted a liberal policy by offering high offices to the Hindus," listing examples such as his Hindu wazir, chief physician, and chief of the bodyguard. This demonstrates a departure from purely sectarian policies. Statement 2 is also supported by the text, which states that the sultan "is also said to have shown great respect to the famous Vaishnavite saint, Chaitanya."  This showcases a degree of religious tolerance and respect for figures outside of his own faith.  Thus, option (c) is the correct answer, as both statements are consistent with the information provided. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the validity of both statements regarding Alauddin Hussain Shah's inclusive and tolerant approach.


**4. With reference to the administrative divisions under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar divided the empire into twelve Subas in 1580, each governed by a Subedar, a Diwan, a Bakhshi, a Sadr, a Qazi, and a Waqia-navis.
2.  The Subas under Akbar included Bengal, Bihar, Allahabad, Awadh, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Multan, Kabul, Ajmer, Malwa, and Gujarat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect Akbar's administrative reforms. Statement 1 correctly describes the structure of provincial governance under Akbar's twelve Subas. The text explicitly mentions the appointment of a Subedar, Diwan, Bakhshi, Sadr, Qazi, and Waqia-navis to each province, illustrating a system of checks and balances designed to ensure efficient and accountable administration. Statement 2 correctly lists the twelve Subas.  The provided text explicitly names Bengal, Bihar, Allahabad, Awadh, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Multan, Kabul, Ajmer, Malwa, and Gujarat as the Subas. Therefore, option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either ignore the accurate description of the provincial administrative structure or the complete list of Subas under Akbar.


**5. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bharmal, the ruler of Amber, in 1562, was a crucial step in solidifying the alliance between the Mughals and the Kachhwahas.
2. Akbar's Rajput policy solely relied on matrimonial alliances to secure the loyalty and cooperation of Rajput rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key aspect of Akbar's Rajput policy. The text explicitly details the marriage of Akbar to Harkha Bai in 1562 as a significant step in forging an alliance with the Kachhwahas, highlighting the political implications of this matrimonial union.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect. While matrimonial alliances were a significant part of Akbar's strategy, it was not his sole method. The text itself notes that Akbar did not insist on matrimonial relations as a precondition for alliances with all Rajput rulers, citing examples of rulers like the Hadas of Ranthambhor who remained in Akbar's favor without such alliances.  Akbar employed a multi-pronged approach that included religious tolerance (abolishing the jizya tax), granting high offices, and offering autonomy to some extent.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is entirely correct, making (a) the appropriate choice. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the nuances of Akbar's Rajput policy, either overemphasizing or underestimating the role of matrimonial alliances.


**6. With reference to the Battle of Haldighati, consider the following statements:**

1. The Battle of Haldighati, fought in 1576, was a decisive Mughal victory that resulted in the immediate and unconditional surrender of Rana Pratap.
2.  Rana Pratap's forces at Haldighati included Rajput troops, an Afghan contingent led by Hakim Khan Sur, and a smaller force of Bhils.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is inaccurate. While the battle saw a tactical advantage for the Mughals, it did not result in Rana Pratap's immediate surrender.  The text clearly states that Rana Pratap escaped after the battle and continued his resistance through guerilla warfare.  The Mughal victory was not decisive in the sense of ending the conflict immediately.  Statement 2, however, is accurate. The text explicitly mentions the composition of Rana Pratap's forces at Haldighati, including Rajput troops, an Afghan contingent under Hakim Khan Sur, and a contingent of Bhils. This demonstrates the diverse nature of his army and alliances.  Therefore, only Statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the outcome and the composition of forces involved in the Battle of Haldighati.


**7. With reference to the economic policies of Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's reign witnessed a significant increase in the area under cultivation due to population growth and Mughal administrative policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The text notes that the area under cultivation expanded during this period, influenced by population growth and Mughal administrative policies. While the text also suggests that this expansion wasn't as rapid as needed, the overall trend of expansion is acknowledged.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  The text indicates that the land revenue under Aurangzeb was quite heavy, often reaching half the produce, including the shares of zamindars and other local elements. This heavy taxation is presented as a factor contributing to the limitations in economic expansion.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is broadly correct, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the realities of Aurangzeb's land revenue system and its impact on the economy.


**8. With reference to the social structure of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The caste system remained largely unchanged during the medieval period, with the smriti writers continuing to emphasize the traditional hierarchy and duties of different castes.
2.  The practice of *sati* was universally condemned and prohibited by both Hindu and Muslim rulers during the medieval period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the persistence of the caste system. The text states that "there were hardly any changes in the structure of the Hindu society during the period," with smriti writers reinforcing traditional caste roles and hierarchies. This highlights the enduring influence of the caste system despite political changes. Statement 2, however, is incorrect. The text mentions the prevalence of *sati*, noting that some writers approved of it while others allowed it under certain conditions.  The practice was not universally condemned or prohibited.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate answer.  Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the status of *sati* and the stability of the caste system during the medieval period.


**9. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate under the Khaljis, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's reign saw the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate's control over Gujarat, Malwa, and parts of Rajasthan.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's administrative reforms included the implementation of strict regulations to prevent conspiracies amongst the nobles, including bans on feasts and marriage alliances without his permission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of Alauddin Khalji's reign. Statement 1 correctly describes the territorial expansion of the Delhi Sultanate under his rule. The text details his conquests of Gujarat, Malwa, and significant portions of Rajasthan, showcasing his military prowess and expansionist ambitions. Statement 2 also accurately depicts his administrative reforms aimed at consolidating power and suppressing dissent among nobles. The text highlights his implementation of strict regulations prohibiting lavish feasts, marriage alliances without his approval, and the establishment of a spy network, illustrating his authoritarian style of governance.  Therefore, option (c) is correct, as both statements are supported by the passage. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect, as they omit either the territorial expansion or the administrative reforms undertaken by Alauddin Khalji.


**10. With reference to the economic conditions during the reign of Alauddin Khalji, consider the following statements:**

1. The daily wages of artisans during Alauddin Khalji's reign were typically 2-3 jitals, translating to approximately 1-2 tankas per month.
2.  Even under Akbar, unskilled laborers earned significantly higher wages than artisans during Alauddin Khalji's reign.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct based on the information provided. Statement 1 accurately reflects the wage levels for artisans during Alauddin Khalji's time, citing the figures of 2-3 jitals per day or 1-2 tankas per month. This shows the relatively low earnings of this segment of the population. Statement 2 is also correct. It draws a comparison between wages during Alauddin Khalji's reign and under Akbar, stating that even under Akbar, unskilled laborers earned only 24 to 3 rupees a month, which was still significantly higher than the wages of artisans under Alauddin Khalji. This highlights the significant economic disparities between different periods and worker classifications.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not fully acknowledge the accuracy of both statements concerning wage disparities in different periods and worker categories.

**1. With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The *pargana*, a sub-unit below the *siq*, was traditionally organized into groups of 100 to 84 villagers, forming the basis of its structure.  The *amil* headed the *pargana*.
2.  While the village administration was largely left undisturbed as long as land revenue was paid, the system of auditing accounts, involving potential harshness, was a key feature of the *muqti* system, relaxed only later under Firuz Tughlaq.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the hierarchical structure of the Delhi Sultanate's administration below the provincial level. The text explicitly mentions the *pargana*’s organization into groups of villagers (100 or 84, traditionally called *chaurasi*) and its leadership by the *amil*. This reflects the Sultanate's attempt to integrate existing village structures into its revenue collection system.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the *muqti* system and its associated auditing process.  The passage clearly states that *muqtis* were responsible for remitting the balance of income after expenses, and that the auditing process often involved harsh measures, including torture and imprisonment. The relaxation of these practices under Firuz Tughlaq is also mentioned, demonstrating a significant administrative shift.  Therefore, both statements are supported by the provided text.


**2.  With reference to the economic conditions during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

However, it also emphasizes the concurrent growth of small towns and local self-sufficiency. The introduction of new crafts, including paper manufacturing, further supports the assertion of economic change.  Therefore, both statements are consistent with the provided information.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly assesses the long-term consequences of Muhammad Tughlaq's capital relocation. While the move to Daulatabad proved impractical, the text acknowledges its positive unintended effects on communication and cultural interaction between North and South India. The movement of officials and people facilitated this exchange.

Statement 2 accurately describes the outcome of his token currency experiment. The text explains the rationale behind introducing the token currency (shortage of silver), but also details its failure due to widespread forgery and the inability to gain public acceptance, resulting in economic disruption.  Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Muhammad Tughlaq's reign.


**5. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Gawan, a significant figure in the Bahmani kingdom, implemented internal reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (*tarafs*), with each governed by a *tarafdar*, and a standardized system of salaries and jagirs for nobles.
2.  Despite Mahmud Gawan's efforts at conciliation, internal strife among the nobles, particularly between the Deccanis and foreigners (*afghans* or *gharibs*), led to the kingdom's disintegration into five principalities after his execution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately portrays Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms. The text details his division of the Bahmani kingdom into eight provinces, the appointment of *tarafdars*, and the establishment of a structured system for noble salaries and *jagirs*. This demonstrates his efforts to strengthen the kingdom's internal organization.

Statement 2 correctly describes the eventual fate of the Bahmani Kingdom. Despite Mahmud Gawan's attempts to mitigate the conflict between the Deccanis and foreign nobles, the text indicates that these internal divisions ultimately led to the kingdom's fragmentation into five principalities following his execution.  The rivalry and power struggles proved insurmountable.  Both statements are supported by the text.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the economic and social conditions of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of long-distance trade in North India led to the decline of trade guilds (shrenis and sanghs), with some eventually transforming into sub-castes.
2.  Dharmashastras of the period imposed bans on travel beyond specific geographical boundaries, primarily to discourage the spread of heretical religious ideas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that the decline of long-distance trade in North India, particularly after the weakening of the Gupta empire, resulted in a decline of trade guilds.  These guilds, often multi-caste organizations with significant economic and social functions, lost their prominence due to reduced interregional commerce. Some older guilds, such as the Dvadasa-shreni, even evolved into Vaishya sub-castes, reflecting the changing socio-economic landscape. This demonstrates a significant shift in the economic structure and social organization of medieval India.  The transformation of guilds into sub-castes reflects the increasing rigidity of the caste system during this period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions restrictions on travel in some Dharmashastras, suggesting a desire to limit exposure to external religious influences, it does not explicitly state that this was the *primary* reason. The text also acknowledges that these restrictions were not strictly enforced, with Indian merchants, scholars, and artisans still traveling to West Asia. This nuance is crucial for understanding the complexity of the socio-religious dynamics of the era. The ban may have been more targeted at Brahmins or aimed at reducing the influx of potentially challenging religious ideologies, but not primarily to curb the spread of such ideas.  The actual motivations behind the travel restrictions remain open to interpretation and further historical analysis.


**2. With reference to the overseas trade of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The chief Indian port for trade with Southeast Asia, particularly Java and Sumatra, was Tamralipti (Tamluk) in Bengal.
2.  Gujarat played a minor role in the maritime trade with China, primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly identifies Tamralipti (Tamluk) in Bengal as a major port for maritime trade with Southeast Asian destinations like Java and Sumatra.  The text provides multiple examples of merchants embarking from Tamralipti for these regions, highlighting its central role in this trade network. This underscores the importance of Bengal in India's overseas trade during the medieval period, and its connections to the broader Indian Ocean trade routes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly mentions that traders from Gujarat actively participated in the trade with China, alongside those from Tamil country and Kalinga.  While the text notes that weather conditions necessitated intermediate ports, it does not suggest that Gujarat's role was minor. In fact, the text highlights the presence of strong shipbuilding traditions in Malabar, Bengal, and Burma, indicating a significant contribution from various regions, including Gujarat, to the maritime capabilities of India.  The statement misrepresents the extent of Gujarat's involvement in the lucrative China trade.


**3. With reference to the economic life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The village administration under the Delhi Sultanate remained largely unchanged in its initial stages, contributing to the quick establishment of Turkish authority in the countryside.
2.  Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed information about the economic condition of ordinary people during the Delhi Sultanate, highlighting their widespread prosperity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that in the initial phases of the Delhi Sultanate, the local-level administration, including land revenue collection, remained largely unchanged. This continuity facilitated a smoother transition of power and contributed to the quick establishment of the Sultanate's control in rural areas.  This strategy of minimal disruption at the village level was a key factor in the successful consolidation of power by the early Delhi Sultans.  The continuity of existing systems allowed for a relatively quick integration of the rural population into the Sultanate's economic framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ibn Battuta's account is mentioned as providing insights into the products, roads, and life of the people, the text does *not* portray widespread prosperity among ordinary people.  Instead, the text discusses the hardships faced by peasants, including recurring famines and wars.  Ibn Battuta's account, while valuable, focuses more on the observable aspects of daily life and trade rather than a comprehensive analysis of the economic condition of the masses.  The passage suggests a significant gap in our understanding of the economic realities of the ordinary people during the Delhi Sultanate, and Ibn Battuta's account, while informative, does not fill this gap entirely.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the cultural developments during the post-Gupta period:**

1.  The Paramara rulers of Ujjain and Dhara were significant patrons of Sanskrit learning, contributing to the flourishing of Sanskrit literature.
2.  The rise of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi during this period was primarily due to the patronage of the Rajput rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions Ujjain and Dhara, the capitals of the Paramara rulers, as prominent centers of Sanskrit learning.  It further highlights the patronage of arts and letters by the Rajput rulers, indirectly supporting the flourishing of Sanskrit literature in these regions. The emphasis on Sanskrit learning in these centers demonstrates the continued influence of classical traditions alongside the emergence of regional languages.  This reflects the complex interaction between established and evolving cultural forms during the period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the passage mentions Rajput patronage of arts and letters, it attributes the emergence of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi to a combination of factors.  These include the decline of Sanskrit's prestige, the influence of Bhakti saints, and the use of regional languages in administration and local kingdoms. The Rajput rulers' patronage undoubtedly played a role, but it wasn't the *primary* driver of the development and growth of these vernacular languages.  The statement oversimplifies the complex linguistic evolution that occurred during this period.


**5. With reference to the economic policies and practices under the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal rupee, a silver coin of high purity, became a standard currency in India and abroad, facilitating trade.
2.  The zabt system, a land revenue assessment system, primarily involved collecting revenue in kind (agricultural produce) rather than cash.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the Mughal Empire minted silver rupees of high purity, which became a standard currency both within India and internationally. This standardization facilitated trade and commerce by providing a reliable and widely accepted medium of exchange. The adoption of the Mughal rupee as a standard currency across vast regions demonstrates the empire's significant impact on the economic life of the subcontinent and its integration into global trade networks.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the passage mentions the zabt system, it clarifies that under this system, land revenue was *assessed* and *required to be paid in cash*. Although peasants sometimes had options like crop-sharing, the state's share was generally sold in the villages for cash, highlighting a significant movement towards a money economy.  The statement incorrectly portrays the zabt system as primarily a system of in-kind revenue collection, overlooking its crucial role in the commercialization of the Mughal economy. The assertion misrepresents the nature of the revenue collection under the zabt system.

This underscores the importance of succession crises in the downfall of empires.  Statement 2 accurately portrays Krishna Deva Raya's reign as a period of resurgence, highlighting his military successes, administrative reforms, and his strategic management of both internal and external challenges, including the emerging Portuguese presence.  This demonstrates an understanding of the complexities of managing a large empire in a period of geopolitical change. The other options incorrectly dismiss the historical accuracy of either one or both statements.


**3. With reference to the cultural interaction between the North and South India during the Medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bahmani kingdom facilitated cultural exchange between North and South India, resulting in a unique cultural synthesis distinct from North Indian traditions, a legacy continued by successor states and influencing Mughal culture.

2. The Vijayanagara empire, while known for its patronage of Hinduism, also demonstrated broad religious tolerance, as evidenced by accounts from foreign travelers like Barbosa, who noted the freedom of religious practice for Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Hindus.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Both statements accurately reflect the cultural dynamics of the medieval period in India. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Bahmani kingdom's role as a bridge between North and South Indian cultures, resulting in a unique blend of traditions that influenced subsequent periods. This showcases an understanding of the complex interplay of cultural influences in medieval India. Statement 2 accurately describes the religious tolerance prevalent in the Vijayanagara Empire, citing Barbosa's account as evidence. This highlights the nuanced nature of religious practices and policies in medieval kingdoms and the need to go beyond simplistic generalizations.  Dismissing either statement would be a misrepresentation of the historical evidence.


**4. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in North India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid Sultan, Muizzuddin Muhammad, after initial setbacks in Gujarat, established a base in the Punjab before his decisive victories at the Battles of Tarain (1191 and 1192) against Prithviraj Chauhan, marking a turning point in Indian history.

2. The Battle of Chandawar (1194), where Jaichandra, the Gahadavala ruler of Kannauj, was killed, solidified Turkish control over the Ganga-Yamuna doab and paved the way for further expansion into Bihar and Bengal.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly outlines Muizzuddin Muhammad's strategic approach, highlighting his initial failure in Gujarat, his consolidation of power in the Punjab, and the significance of his victories at Tarain in altering the course of Indian history. This demonstrates an understanding of military strategy and its impact on political power. Statement 2 accurately describes the Battle of Chandawar and its consequences, emphasizing the death of Jaichandra and the subsequent expansion of Turkish rule into the Ganga-Yamuna doab and beyond. This highlights the process of conquest and the consolidation of power in the region.  Rejecting either statement would be a misinterpretation of the historical narrative.


**5.  With reference to the Mughal Empire's administration and nobility, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Akbar, Hindus were increasingly inducted into the Mughal nobility, with Rajputs initially forming a significant portion, but this inclusion did not significantly alter the overall aristocratic character of the nobility, which remained largely dominated by those with hereditary claims to power.

2.  The Mughal nobility, while receiving extremely high salaries, incurred substantial expenses maintaining large households, stables, and engaging in lavish lifestyles, contributing both positively and negatively to the economy through land acquisition, investment, and sometimes exploitative practices.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the complexities of the Mughal Empire’s nobility.  Statement 1 correctly notes the inclusion of Hindus, particularly Rajputs, into the Mughal nobility under Akbar. However, it also accurately points out that this inclusion, while significant, did not fundamentally alter the aristocratic nature of the system, which remained rooted in hereditary status and power. This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the social dynamics within the Mughal administration. Statement 2 accurately describes the extravagant lifestyle of the Mughal nobility, their high salaries, and the resulting economic impacts, including both positive contributions like land development and investment and negative aspects such as exploitative practices.  This shows an understanding of the multifaceted role of the nobility in the Mughal economy.  The other options fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements in their descriptions of Mughal social and economic structures.


**1. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Gawan, an Iranian by birth, implemented internal reforms that included dividing the kingdom into eight provinces, each governed by a tarafdar, and establishing a fixed salary system for nobles payable in cash or jagir.
2. The Bahmani Kingdom's most significant challenge stemmed from the intense rivalry between the long-established Deccanis and the newcomer foreign nobles (afgans), culminating in Mahmud Gawan's execution in 1482, which triggered the kingdom's disintegration into five principalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms within the Bahmani Kingdom.  His reforms aimed at streamlining governance, establishing a more structured system of provincial administration (eight tarafs), and regulating the financial obligations and compensations of nobles, offering payment options in cash or through jagirs (land grants). This demonstrates his efforts towards establishing a more centralized and efficient administrative structure.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the internal strife within the Bahmani Kingdom as a major factor contributing to its decline.  The conflict between the Deccanis (long-standing residents) and the afgans (foreigner nobles), including Mahmud Gawan himself, created deep divisions and political instability. Mahmud Gawan's execution, despite his conciliatory efforts, exacerbated these tensions. This ultimately led to the fracturing of the Bahmani Kingdom into five successor states: Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Bidar.  The internal power struggles and factionalism significantly weakened the kingdom, paving the way for its disintegration.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect crucial aspects of the Bahmani Kingdom's history.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Following the death of Deva Raya II in 1446, the Vijayanagara Empire experienced a period of internal strife marked by civil wars among contenders to the throne, leading to the rise of powerful ministers and the eventual usurpation of the throne by Saluva Narasimha, marking the end of the Sangama dynasty.
2. Krishna Deva Raya (1509-1530), considered by some historians as the greatest Vijayanagara ruler, successfully re-established internal order, expanded the empire's territories, and implemented significant administrative reforms, while also patronizing Telugu, Kannada, and Tamil literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the political instability and succession crises that plagued the Vijayanagara Empire after the death of Deva Raya II. The absence of a clear succession law led to internal conflicts and power struggles among various claimants to the throne. This period witnessed the rise of powerful ministers who exploited the situation to enhance their own influence, ultimately culminating in the overthrow of the Sangama dynasty and the establishment of the Saluva dynasty under Saluva Narasimha. This highlights the fragility of the empire's political structure during this transition.

Statement 2 correctly portrays the significant achievements of Krishna Deva Raya.  His reign is widely acknowledged as a period of resurgence and consolidation for the Vijayanagara Empire. He successfully restored internal order after a period of turmoil, expanded the empire's boundaries through military campaigns against rivals like Orissa and the Bahmani sultanates, and implemented administrative reforms to strengthen the empire's governance. His patronage of arts and literature, particularly Telugu, Kannada, and Tamil, is also well-documented, signifying a flourishing cultural period.  The combination of military success, administrative reforms, and cultural patronage makes his reign a significant landmark in Vijayanagara history.  Therefore, both statements are factually accurate.


**3. With reference to the Orissa kingdom and its interactions with neighboring powers, consider the following statements:**

1. After 1450, Orissa rulers launched extensive raids into South India, reaching as far south as Madurai, and extending their territories up to the Krishna River, significantly weakening the Vijayanagara Empire, which was already facing internal conflicts.
2. The Gajapati dynasty of Orissa, known for its military prowess and construction of grand temples like the Puri Jagannath Temple and the Sun Temple at Konark, engaged in conflicts with the Bengal Sultanate, particularly along the Saraswati River boundary, and also expanded towards Karnataka, leading to clashes with Vijayanagara and the Bahmani kingdoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the expansionist activities of the Orissa kingdom in the 15th century.  Their military campaigns extended deep into South India, reaching the far south to Madurai, highlighting their considerable military strength and ambition.  These raids significantly weakened the already unstable Vijayanagara Empire, which was grappling with internal dissensions. The expansion up to the Krishna River further underscores their territorial gains and impact on regional power dynamics.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the Gajapati dynasty's role in the political landscape of the period.  Their military prowess is well-established, and the construction of the magnificent Puri Jagannath Temple and Konark Sun Temple reflects their patronage of art and architecture. Their conflicts with the Bengal Sultanate, particularly along the Saraswati River, indicate a continuous struggle for territorial control.  Furthermore, their southward expansion into Karnataka inevitably led to confrontations with the powerful Vijayanagara and Bahmani kingdoms, showcasing their ambition and the complex power struggles of the time. Thus, both statements accurately depict the significant role played by the Orissa kingdom in the regional context.


**4. With reference to the early Mughal period and the Battle of Khanwa, consider the following statements:**

1. The Battle of Khanwa (1527) between Babur and Rana Sanga was a decisive victory for Babur, securing his position in the Delhi-Agra region, and it involved a large Rajput confederacy, including contingents from various Rajput states, alongside Afghan forces.
2. Rana Sanga's forces at Khanwa significantly outnumbered Babur's, but Babur's superior military tactics, particularly the effective use of artillery and flanking maneuvers, as demonstrated at Panipat, led to his victory, despite fierce initial Rajput attacks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly highlights the key outcomes and participants of the Battle of Khanwa.  Babur's victory was indeed decisive, consolidating his control over the strategically important Delhi-Agra region. The battle involved a formidable Rajput confederacy, united under Rana Sanga's leadership, which included contingents from various Rajput states. The presence of Afghan forces further emphasizes the wide-ranging opposition Babur faced. This victory was a crucial step in establishing the Mughal Empire in India.

Statement 2 accurately describes the military aspects of the battle. The numerical superiority of Rana Sanga's forces is a well-known fact. However, Babur's skillful military strategies, leveraging his experience from previous battles like Panipat, proved crucial. The effective deployment of artillery, combined with his characteristic flanking maneuvers, allowed him to overcome the initial Rajput onslaught. While the Rajput forces fought valiantly, Babur's tactical superiority ultimately determined the outcome.  Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about the Battle of Khanwa and its significance.


**5. With reference to the reign of Akbar and his Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's Rajput policy involved strategic matrimonial alliances, primarily to consolidate his power and integrate Rajput elites into the Mughal administration; the marriage with Harkha Bai, daughter of Bharmal of Amber, is a prime example of this policy's success.
2. Akbar's policy extended beyond matrimonial alliances; he also abolished the jizya tax, demonstrating religious tolerance, and he treated Rajput rulers with respect and autonomy, thereby fostering loyalty and cooperation, even without matrimonial alliances, as seen with the Hadas of Ranthambhor.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately captures a key aspect of Akbar's Rajput policy.  The strategic use of matrimonial alliances was a significant component of his approach.  Marrying into Rajput royal families, such as his marriage with Harkha Bai, daughter of Bharmal of Amber, served multiple purposes: it helped to forge alliances, integrate Rajput elites into the Mughal administration, and reduce the potential for conflict. The success of this aspect of his policy is evident in the long-term cooperation and integration of many Rajput houses into the Mughal system.

Statement 2 correctly points out the broader dimensions of Akbar's Rajput policy. While matrimonial alliances were an important tool, his approach was not solely reliant on them.  The abolition of the jizya tax is a clear example of his religious tolerance and his efforts to win over the non-Muslim population.  Furthermore, his policy of granting autonomy and respect to Rajput rulers, even without matrimonial ties (as exemplified by his relationship with the Hadas of Ranthambhor), showcases his pragmatic and inclusive approach to governance. This multifaceted approach contributed to the relative stability and integration of Rajput states into the Mughal Empire.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect Akbar's sophisticated and successful Rajput policy.


**1. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule (1493-1519) is considered a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, marked by the flourishing of several famous Bengali writers.
2.  His administration saw the appointment of Hindus to high government positions, including his wazir, chief physician, and master of the mint, reflecting a policy of religious tolerance.

This directly supports statement 1.  Furthermore, the passage highlights his inclusive policy by mentioning the appointments of Hindus to high-ranking positions within his administration.  The mention of a Hindu wazir, chief physician, and master of the mint clearly demonstrates his policy of religious tolerance and the integration of Hindus into his government. This validates statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule in Bengal. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements, which are demonstrably true based on the provided information.  The question tests factual recall regarding a specific ruler's reign and its impact on language and administration.


**2. With reference to the political landscape of North-East India during the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Hussain Shah's conquest of Kamata (Kamrup) resulted in the destruction of Kamtapur and its annexation to Bengal, establishing a significant expansion of his kingdom's northeastern boundary beyond the Karatoya River.
2.  A subsequent Mughal attempt to conquer the Ahom kingdom under Suhungmung (Svarga Narayana), likely under Nusrat Shah, was unsuccessful, showcasing the strength and resilience of the Ahom kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage details Alauddin Hussain Shah's successful military campaign against Kamata, culminating in the destruction of Kamtapur and its incorporation into the Bengal Sultanate. This expansion extended Bengal's northeastern boundary beyond the Karatoya River, confirming the accuracy of statement 1. The text also recounts a failed subsequent attack on the Ahom kingdom by a successor of Alauddin Hussain Shah, probably Nusrat Shah. This unsuccessful campaign against Suhungmung (Svarga Narayana), a powerful Ahom ruler, underscores the military strength and resistance of the Ahom kingdom, thereby supporting statement 2.  The options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not reflect the accurate depiction of both statements, which are supported by the provided textual evidence. This question tests the candidate's understanding of regional conflicts and power dynamics in medieval India, demanding specific knowledge of the rulers and events involved.


**3. With reference to the religious policies of Alauddin Hussain Shah, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule witnessed the elevation of prominent Vaishnava figures, Rupa and Sanatan, to high positions in his court, indicating a degree of religious tolerance and acceptance of different faiths.
2.  The Sultan's demonstrated respect for the renowned Vaishnavite saint Chaitanya further reinforces his reputation for religious tolerance and syncretism during his rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that Rupa and Sanatan, two brothers celebrated for their Vaishnava piety, held significant positions within Alauddin Hussain Shah's court.  One was even his private secretary. This directly supports statement 1 and demonstrates the Sultan's acceptance of Vaishnavism.  Furthermore, the text mentions the Sultan's respectful attitude towards the famous Vaishnavite saint Chaitanya. This further reinforces the idea of religious tolerance and the Sultan's willingness to engage with different religious figures and traditions. This corroborates statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of Alauddin Hussain Shah's religious policies. The other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the validity of both statements, which are clearly supported by the given information.  This question assesses the candidate's ability to analyze the religious implications of a ruler's actions and policies, testing their understanding of religious syncretism in medieval India.


**4. With reference to the expansionist policies of the Bengal Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bengal Sultanate's attempts to control the Brahmaputra Valley involved conflicts with both the Kamata and Ahom kingdoms, highlighting the challenges faced in extending control over this geographically diverse region.
2.  The conquest of Chittagong from Arakan and Tipperah from its ruler under Sultan Hussain Shah demonstrated the Sultanate's ambition to expand its influence towards the east and southeast.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

This demonstrates a degree of inclusivity within his administration, supporting statement 1. The text also mentions Ahmad Shah I's relocation of the capital to Ahmedabad and his extensive building projects, which included palaces, bazars, mosques, and madrasas, showcasing a unique architectural style that blended existing traditions. This confirms statement 2. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize that both statements are accurate reflections of Ahmad Shah I's reign in Gujarat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This constant antagonism prevented them from uniting and playing a more influential role in the overall political landscape of North India. This directly supports statement 1.  The text also describes Muzaffar Shah's actions regarding Hushang Shah of Malwa.  His imprisonment and later release, intended to resolve the conflict, actually intensified Malwa's distrust of Gujarat's power.  This confirms statement 2.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements, which are clearly supported by the passage. This question tests the candidate's understanding of inter-state relations and their impact on the broader political dynamics of medieval India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the text mentions the Mongol threat appearing in 1221 during the reign of Iltutmish,  and Jalaluddin Khalji's victory in 1292, it does *not* state that the first Mongol invasion happened during Jalaluddin Khalji's reign. This makes statement 1 incorrect. However, the passage accurately describes how the repeated Mongol invasions forced the Delhi Sultanate, particularly under Alauddin Khalji, to strengthen its military and administrative systems to effectively counter the threat.  The successful repelling of subsequent Mongol attacks demonstrates the Sultanate's enhanced capabilities, validating statement 2.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Mongol invasions' impact on the Delhi Sultanate, requiring knowledge of specific events and their chronological order.  The candidate needs to differentiate between the initial threat and the Sultanate's eventual response.

This confirms statement 2.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the internal challenges faced by the Delhi Sultanate, requiring knowledge of the diverse actors involved in these rebellions and the geographical challenges to central authority.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that the loss of Gujarat, a crucial center for overseas trade, dealt a severe blow to the Pratihara empire.  This loss directly impacted the Rashtrakutas’ access to vital trade routes and revenue streams connected to West Asia.  The decline in trade severely weakened their economic and political power.  Understanding the strategic importance of Gujarat's ports within the larger context of medieval Indian trade is crucial for answering this question correctly.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The passage clearly mentions Krishna III's military victory against Parantaka I in 949 CE, resulting in the annexation of the northern territories of the Chola Empire.  This expansion demonstrates Krishna III's military prowess and the empire's ambition to extend its influence southwards.  This showcases the Rashtrakutas' aggressive expansionist policy and their significant military capabilities in the Deccan region during the 10th century.  The ability to recall this specific military engagement and its consequences is key to evaluating the second statement accurately.

This demonstrates the continuity and evolution of administrative systems in medieval India, showcasing how successful empires adapted and built upon pre-existing models.  Understanding the interconnectedness of these historical empires and their administrative structures is key to grasping the nuances of the Rashtrakuta system.

Statement 2 is also correct. The provided text mentions that Amoghavarsha I faced numerous rebellions during his long reign.  This highlights the challenges of maintaining control over a large and geographically dispersed empire, even for a capable ruler like Amoghavarsha.  The ability to recall this aspect of Amoghavarsha I's reign is essential for a correct assessment of the second statement.  It shows that even successful rulers faced challenges in maintaining stability across their empire.

**3. With reference to the military organization of the Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta empires, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pratihara kings possessed a superior cavalry force compared to their contemporaries, largely due to horse imports from Central Asia and Arabia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage specifically mentions the Pratihara kings as possessing the finest cavalry in India, attributing this to the import of horses from Central Asia and Arabia. This highlights the importance of military technology and logistical capabilities in establishing and maintaining power during this period.  The statement accurately reflects the military strength of the Pratiharas and their strategic reliance on imported resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the passage mentions the Pala and Rashtrakuta empires engaging in overseas trade, it does *not* explicitly state that they maintained significant naval forces. The text only alludes to the possibility of naval capabilities, not confirming their strength or organization.  This highlights the importance of precise reading and avoiding assumptions based on circumstantial evidence. The existence of trade does not automatically imply a powerful navy.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the religious policies of the Rashtrakuta rulers:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the Rashtrakuta rulers were tolerant in their religious views and patronized Saivism, Vaishnavism, and Jainism. This demonstrates a policy of religious pluralism, which was not uncommon among some medieval Indian rulers, allowing for the peaceful coexistence of different faiths.  The statement incorrectly portrays the Rashtrakuta religious policy as oppressive.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the Rashtrakuta patronage of Saivism, Vaishnavism, and Jainism, highlighting their religious tolerance and the multifaceted nature of their cultural patronage. This demonstrates the complex relationship between political power and religious practices during the period. The construction of the Ellora caves is cited as an example of their patronage of religious art and architecture.

This highlights the Chola Empire's naval power and its ambition to project its influence beyond the Indian subcontinent. The statement accurately reflects the extent of Rajaraja I’s conquests.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Rajendra I did consolidate Chola power, the passage also highlights his continued expansionist policy, encompassing the complete subjugation of the Pandya and Chera kingdoms.  This indicates that Rajendra I's ambitions extended beyond mere consolidation.  The statement underestimates the scale of Rajendra I's military campaigns.


**6. With reference to the political situation in North India during the reign of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

This highlights a significant shift in the power dynamics within the Delhi Sultanate, showcasing the rise of non-Turkish elements within the ruling elite.  The statement accurately reflects a pivotal moment in the Sultanate's history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Balban made efforts to secure these frontiers, the passage indicates that the Sultanate’s control over these areas remained precarious, facing constant challenges from Rajput rulers and other factions.  Balban's successes were partial and temporary, not leading to a permanent resolution of the border conflicts.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate view of Balban's achievements.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the passage mentions a siege, it also highlights that the conquest of Girnar was facilitated by treason within the fort.  This indicates that military strategy was complemented by internal political machinations.  The statement oversimplifies the conquest, neglecting the crucial element of treachery.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that during Mahmud Begarha's reign, trade and commerce in Gujarat flourished, indicating a period of relative peace and prosperity under his rule.

The passage emphasizes Malwa's strategic location, highlighting its importance as a contested territory among powerful states such as Gujarat, Mewar, the Bahmanis, and the Delhi Sultans.  This underscores the geopolitical significance of Malwa and its role in the broader power struggles of North India.  The statement accurately reflects the kingdom's strategic importance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some rulers like Hushang Shah were known for religious tolerance, the passage mentions Mahmud Khalji's destruction of temples, indicating that religious tolerance was not a consistent policy throughout Malwa's history.  The statement presents an inaccurate generalization about the religious policies of Malwa's rulers.  The passage shows that religious tolerance was not a consistent policy throughout the kingdom’s history.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Dharmapala achieved significant territorial gains, the passage suggests that his control extended to the northwestern limits, but it doesn't definitively confirm the inclusion of Malwa and Berar.  The text only indicates the acceptance of Dharmapala’s suzerainty by some vassal rulers, not direct control over these territories.  The statement is an overstatement of Dharmapala's territorial reach.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions Devapala’s expansion into Assam, parts of Orissa, and possibly Nepal. This demonstrates the empire's growth and ambitious foreign policy under his rule.  The statement accurately reflects the territorial gains under Devapala.

**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's expansion under Rajaraja and Rajendra I, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the Chola Empire maintaining control over the island for over half a century.
2. The Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur, completed in 1010, stands as a testament to the Chola rulers' practice of commemorating victories through temple construction and inscriptions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola expansion under Rajaraja and Rajendra I.  Statement 1 correctly notes that Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in prolonged Chola control, lasting for more than 50 years. This showcases the empire's military strength and its ability to maintain dominion over conquered territories.  The statement avoids ambiguity by directly stating the duration of Chola control, avoiding any potential for misinterpretation.

Statement 2 accurately highlights the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur as a significant architectural achievement of the Chola period, completed in 1010. It correctly links this construction to the Chola practice of using temples as commemorative monuments,  recording their military successes via inscriptions. This practice is crucial to understanding the Chola's approach to governance and their systematic recording of historical events. The inscriptions within these temples serve as invaluable primary sources for historians studying the Chola period.  Therefore, both statements are accurate reflections of historical fact.


**2. With reference to the Chola naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola navy's dominance extended to the entire Bay of Bengal for a considerable period, solidifying their control over maritime trade routes to China.
2.  The conflict between the Cholas and the Srivijaya Empire primarily stemmed from religious differences, with the Sailendra dynasty's Buddhist beliefs clashing with the Chola's predominantly Hindu faith.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the extent of Chola naval power. Their strong navy controlled the Bay of Bengal, impacting trade routes to China.  This reflects the Chola empire's maritime capabilities and their influence on regional commerce. The statement is precise in stating the extent of their naval dominance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sailendra dynasty of Srivijaya were Buddhists and the Cholas were largely Hindu, the primary cause of conflict wasn't religious differences. The conflict stemmed from the Chola's ambition to control trade routes and remove obstacles for Indian merchants accessing the lucrative trade with China.  The existence of a Buddhist monastery at Nagapatnam, endowed by Rajendra I at the Sailendra ruler's request, highlights the initial cordiality and the economic factors driving the later conflict.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**3. With reference to the Chola administration, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola army consisted solely of infantry, reflecting a land-based military strategy.
2. The Chola village administration, particularly in Brahman villages (agraharams), featured significant local autonomy, with assemblies like the Sabha managing village affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chola army was not solely infantry-based. It comprised elephants, cavalry, and infantry, representing a diverse military structure capable of land and potentially some limited amphibious operations. This reflects a more comprehensive military strategy than solely relying on infantry.

Statement 2 is correct and reflects a key feature of the Chola administration. The Sabha and Ur assemblies in Chola villages, particularly the agraharams, demonstrate a remarkable degree of local self-governance.  These assemblies managed village affairs, including land revenue, justice, and water distribution. This illustrates the decentralized nature of Chola administration and its reliance on local institutions.  The detailed functioning of the Sabha, with its elected committees and rotational system, further highlights the sophistication of Chola village administration. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. With reference to the later Chalukyas and their relationship with the Cholas, consider the following statements:**

1. The conflict between the Cholas and later Chalukyas centered primarily on religious differences, leading to widespread religious persecution.
2.  The protracted conflict between the Cholas and later Chalukyas over territories like Vengi and the Tungabhadra doab ultimately exhausted both kingdoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The conflict between the Cholas and later Chalukyas was not primarily driven by religious differences.  While there were instances of brutality and plunder, including the sacking of Kalyani, the core of the conflict was political and strategic, focused on territorial control and overlordship of crucial regions like Vengi and the Tungabhadra doab.  The conflict was for power and resources, not religious supremacy.

Statement 2 is correct. The prolonged struggle between the Cholas and later Chalukyas over these strategically important regions depleted the resources and manpower of both kingdoms.  This ultimately weakened both empires, contributing to their eventual decline and paving the way for the rise of other powers in South India.  The statement accurately reflects the debilitating effect of the prolonged conflict.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**5. With reference to the cultural exchange during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1. Abul Fazl and Faizi, brothers and key figures in Akbar's court, primarily focused on promoting Sanskrit literature and philosophy.
2. The development of Medieval Hindi in the Braj form was largely influenced by Persian literary traditions under the patronage of both Mughal emperors and Hindu rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Abul Fazl and Faizi were influential figures in Akbar's court and contributed significantly to the cultural landscape, their primary focus wasn't Sanskrit literature. Abul Fazl is known for his prose writing in Persian, and Faizi oversaw the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian, reflecting a focus on Persian and not Sanskrit.  Their contributions were primarily within the Persian literary and historical sphere.

Statement 2 is correct.  Medieval Hindi in the Braj form, a dialect spoken near Agra, flourished under the patronage of both Mughal emperors and Hindu rulers. This period saw a significant fusion of Persian and Hindi literary traditions, with poets incorporating Persian ideas into their work and vice versa. The example of Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan, a Mughal noble who blended Bhakti poetry with Persian influences, illustrates this cultural synthesis.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1. Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, focused solely on the worship of Vishnu and strictly adhered to the caste system.
2. Kabir and Nanak, while both advocating for monotheism, differed significantly in their approaches to religious practices and social reform.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ramananda, while a follower of Ramanuja,  shifted the focus from Vishnu to Rama and importantly, he broke away from strict adherence to the caste system. He taught his doctrine of Bhakti to all four varnas, allowing people of different castes to cook and eat together, thereby challenging traditional social hierarchies.  This directly contradicts the statement's assertion of strict adherence to the caste system.

Statement 2 is correct. Kabir and Nanak both emphasized the concept of one God, but their approaches differed. Kabir strongly denounced idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious practices, while Nanak, while also rejecting idol worship and formal rituals, emphasized the importance of a guru for guidance and the purity of character and conduct.  Their approaches to social reform also differed, with Kabir focusing more on individual reform, while Nanak's teachings eventually led to the establishment of Sikhism as a distinct religion.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire under Deva Raya I and II, consider the following statements:**

1. Deva Raya II's empire encompassed tributary states including those in Burma and Malaya, indicating extensive control over maritime trade routes.
2. The accounts of foreign travellers like Nicolo Conti and Abdur Razzaq highlight the empire's immense wealth, military strength, and the cosmopolitan nature of its capital city.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1, while slightly exaggerated, is largely correct in its essence.  Deva Raya II's empire did have contact with and received tributes from various kingdoms, including some in Southeast Asia. This shows the far-reaching influence of the Vijayanagara Empire, though the extent of "control" over places like Pegu and Tenasserim might be debated by historians. The tributes and embassies demonstrate significant interaction and diplomatic influence.

Statement 2 is entirely correct. The accounts of Nicolo Conti and Abdur Razzaq provide strong evidence of Vijayanagara's wealth, military power, and cosmopolitan nature.  They highlight the vast size of the capital city, its impressive fortifications, its bustling markets, and the presence of people from various backgrounds. The descriptions reflect the empire's economic prosperity, military strength, and its status as a major center of trade and cultural exchange.  Therefore, both statements are largely accurate.


**8.  With reference to the Bahmani kingdom and its relationship with other powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign witnessed a decline in the influence of Hindu administrators within the Bahmani government.
2. The Bahmani kingdom's expansion under Mahmud Gawan included significant gains on the western coast, weakening the Vijayanagara Empire's control over key ports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Firuz Shah Bahmani's reign, contrary to the statement, is noted for a significant increase in the number of Hindus, particularly Deccani Brahmans, holding prominent positions in the administration, especially in revenue collection. This reflects a policy of inclusiveness rather than a decline in Hindu influence.

Statement 2 is correct. Mahmud Gawan's administration saw the Bahmani kingdom expand its territories considerably. A crucial aspect of this expansion was the conquest of western coastal areas, including Dabhol and Goa. The loss of these important ports significantly weakened Vijayanagara's control over maritime trade and its overall economic strength.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**9. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The rise of regional languages was solely due to the decline in the prestige of Sanskrit following the loss of power by the Brahmans.
2.  The patronage of Muslim rulers played a significant role in the development of literature in regional languages, such as the translation of the Mahabharata and Ramayana into Bengali under Nusrat Shah.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification. While the decline in Sanskrit's prestige and the rise of vernacular languages were related, the factors were more complex. The Bhakti movement's use of regional languages, pre-existing administrative use of regional languages in some kingdoms, and the increasing popularity of vernacular literature all contributed to the shift.  It wasn't solely the decline of Sanskrit and Brahmanical influence.

Statement 2 is correct. Muslim rulers did play a crucial role in the development of literature in regional languages. Nusrat Shah's patronage of Bengali literature, including the translation of epics, is a clear example. This patronage helped elevate the status of regional languages and fostered their growth as literary mediums. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**10. With reference to the Ghaznavid raids into India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's raids were primarily motivated by a desire to spread Islam and convert the Indian population to the Muslim faith.
2.  The Rajput rulers consistently united against Mahmud of Ghazni's incursions, posing a significant and unified military challenge.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahmud of Ghazni presented his raids as jihads, the primary motivation was plunder and acquisition of wealth.  The immense riches obtained from these raids were crucial for funding his wars in Central Asia.  While religious zeal played a role, it was secondary to the economic and strategic goals.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Rajput rulers did not present a consistently united front against Mahmud of Ghazni's raids.  They often fought independently, and their internal conflicts and lack of coordination allowed Mahmud to exploit their weaknesses. The absence of a strong, unified Indian power at that time allowed Mahmud to conduct his raids with relative impunity.  Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**1. With reference to the Mongol invasions of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus River served as the consistent western boundary of the Delhi Sultanate throughout the 13th century, effectively preventing Mongol incursions beyond it.
2.  The Mongol leader, Changez Khan, personally led multiple campaigns into India, resulting in significant territorial losses for the Delhi Sultanate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Changez Khan did not cross into India, the western boundary of the Delhi Sultanate fluctuated throughout the 13th century due to Mongol incursions.  Initially, the Indus River served as a barrier, but after subsequent attacks, the frontier receded to the Sutlej, and even further east to the Beas River under pressure from Mongol forces. The Sultanate’s western boundary was not consistent and continuously shifted due to the ongoing Mongol threat.  The text explicitly states that the Indus ceased to be India's western boundary after Mongol attacks.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Changez Khan himself did not invade India. While he pursued Jalaluddin Mingburnu to the Indus, he ultimately chose not to cross into India, focusing instead on consolidating his control over the remaining Khwarizmian territories. The Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate were led by various commanders under different khans, not Changez Khan directly.  The text highlights Changez Khan's decision *not* to invade India as a pivotal moment.  Subsequent Mongol invasions were conducted by commanders like Tair Bahadur and later, under the pressure from the Chagatai Khanate.


**2. With reference to the internal rebellions within the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rebellions were solely led by ambitious Hindu Rajput rulers aiming to overthrow the Turkish rule.
2.  The eastern region of India, encompassing Bengal and Bihar, remained consistently under the firm control of the Delhi Sultanate throughout the 13th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajput rulers did participate in rebellions against the Delhi Sultanate, aiming to regain lost territories or exploit the Sultanate's vulnerabilities, the rebellions were not solely led by them.  The text clearly mentions rebellions led by ambitious Muslim chiefs who sought independence, showcasing the internal conflicts within the ruling class itself.  The diverse nature of the rebellions demonstrates a complex political landscape and cannot be simplified as solely Hindu resistance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that Bengal and Bihar remained outside the control of the Delhi Sultanate for a significant portion of the 13th century. While the Sultanate attempted to reassert its control under rulers like Iltutmish and Balban, these regions frequently challenged Delhi's authority, achieving periods of independence or semi-independence. The text details the ongoing struggle for control over Bengal and Bihar, highlighting the challenges the Delhi Sultanate faced in maintaining its authority in these regions.


**3. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Khalji, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Khalji's primary focus was on religious tolerance and conciliation with Hindu populations, leading to a period of unprecedented peace and stability.
2.  Alauddin Khalji implemented strict regulations to control the nobility, including bans on lavish feasts and marriage alliances without his permission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Alauddin Khalji's reign witnessed military expansion, his policies were far from characterized by religious tolerance.  The text highlights his ruthless suppression of rebellions, including the massacre of Mongols who had converted to Islam, demonstrating a harsh and authoritarian approach, not one of conciliation. His policies were focused on consolidating power and centralizing authority, not religious harmony.

Statement 2 is correct. The text details Alauddin Khalji's strict measures to control the nobility, preventing them from conspiring against him. This included bans on large gatherings, festivities, and even marriage alliances without his consent.  He also implemented a spy network to monitor the nobles' activities. These actions were designed to curtail potential threats to his rule and maintain absolute power.


**4. With reference to the economic policies of Alauddin Khalji, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's land revenue reforms resulted in a significant decrease in the agricultural output and widespread rural poverty.
2. Alauddin Khalji implemented a system of paying soldiers entirely in cash, abolishing the earlier practice of land grants for salaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the passage doesn't explicitly state the overall impact on agricultural output,  Alauddin Khalji’s land revenue reforms aimed at improving the efficiency of revenue collection and strengthening the state's control over agricultural production. While there might have been some negative consequences for some segments of the population, it is inaccurate to say his reforms led to a significant *decrease* in agricultural output and widespread rural poverty. The reforms were intended to increase revenue for the state and ensure a more reliable food supply.

Statement 2 is correct. The text describes Alauddin Khalji's decision to pay soldiers entirely in cash, ending the previous system of assigning villages for their salaries.  This was a significant administrative reform aiming to increase the Sultanate's control over its military and prevent the soldiers from developing semi-independent power bases in the countryside.  The abolition of land grants as salaries was a key step in centralizing military power and improving the efficiency of payment.


**5.  With reference to the reign of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1.  The transfer of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad was a resounding success, significantly improving the Sultanate's control over Southern India.
2.  Muhammad bin Tughlaq's experiment with token currency was a complete failure, leading to widespread economic chaos and devaluation of the currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's decision to shift the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (Deogir) is widely considered a major administrative blunder. While intended to improve control over the south, the forced migration caused immense hardship, leading to widespread discontent and ultimately, the abandonment of Daulatabad as the capital. The text details the logistical difficulties and negative consequences of this move, highlighting its failure to achieve its intended objective.

Statement 2 is correct. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's introduction of token currency (bronze coins equivalent to silver tankas) is considered a significant economic failure. The inability to prevent widespread counterfeiting led to the rapid devaluation of the currency, causing significant economic disruption. The text describes the eventual withdrawal of the token currency and the vast quantities of worthless coins left behind, underscoring the failure of this experiment.


**6. With reference to the internal administration of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *wazir* primarily held military command, functioning as the commander-in-chief of the Sultanate's armed forces.
2.  The *diwan-i-arz* was responsible for recruiting, equipping, and paying the Sultanate's army.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the *wazir* held significant power and influence in the Delhi Sultanate, their primary role was not military command.  The Sultan himself was the supreme commander of the armed forces. The *wazir*'s responsibilities primarily revolved around administration, finance, and revenue management. Over time, the *wazir*'s role shifted towards being more of a financial expert.

Statement 2 is correct. The *diwan-i-arz*, or the military department, was indeed responsible for the recruitment, equipping, and payment of the Sultanate's army.  The text explains the significance of this department, particularly under rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Balban, who focused on improving its efficiency and organization.  The *diwan-i-arz* was crucial for maintaining a strong and well-equipped army, essential for the Sultanate's power and stability.


**7. With reference to the social and economic conditions during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate saw a significant decline in urban centers and a shift towards a predominantly rural economy.
2.  The introduction of the spinning wheel and improved cotton-cleaning techniques significantly boosted textile production during the Sultanate period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Delhi Sultanate witnessed a flourishing urban economy, with major cities like Delhi, Multan, and Cambay playing crucial roles in regional and international trade.  The text details the growth of towns, the presence of wealthy merchants, and the development of various crafts and industries, indicating a vibrant urban economic landscape, not a decline.  The growth of urban centers was linked to the improved trade and communications under the Sultanate.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions the introduction or wider adoption of the spinning wheel and improved cotton-cleaning techniques as contributing factors to the growth of textile production during the Delhi Sultanate. These technological improvements enhanced the efficiency of textile manufacturing, contributing to India's flourishing textile trade.  The text highlights the importance of Indian textiles in international trade.


**8. With reference to the early phases of the Turkish conquest in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The battles of Tarain and Chandawar directly resulted in the immediate and complete establishment of the Delhi Sultanate's control over the entire Indian subcontinent.
2.  Bhaktiyar Khalji's conquest of Bengal was met with immediate and widespread resistance, preventing the consolidation of Turkish rule in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The battles of Tarain and Chandawar were crucial victories for the Turks, laying the foundation for their rule in North India, but did not lead to immediate control over the entire subcontinent. The consolidation of Turkish rule was a gradual process, spanning decades and involving numerous conflicts and challenges, as detailed in the provided text.  The Sultanate’s expansion was a protracted process, not an immediate outcome of these battles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bhaktiyar Khalji's conquest of Bengal involved initial surprise and the overthrow of Lakshmana Sena, it was not met with immediate and widespread resistance that prevented the consolidation of Turkish rule. The text shows that while Lakshmana Sena escaped, the initial conquest was relatively swift.  The subsequent challenges to Turkish rule in Bengal were largely internal struggles and conflicts with neighboring kingdoms, not immediate and widespread resistance to the initial conquest itself.  The text highlights the subsequent difficulties in maintaining control over Bengal.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajput response to the Turkish invasions:**

1.  Rajput armies were significantly smaller in number than the Turkish armies due to strict caste restrictions limiting participation in warfare.
2.  The Rajputs lacked a unified strategic vision in responding to the Turkish advance, failing to coordinate their efforts effectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly refutes this claim. It states that while caste did play a role, it did not prevent non-Rajputs or lower castes from participating in battles, resulting in Rajput armies being larger in number than those fielded by the Turks.  The assertion that Rajput armies were smaller due to caste restrictions is contradicted by the given text.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage highlights the lack of a unified strategic vision among the Rajputs as a crucial factor contributing to their defeat. The failure to coordinate their defense against the Turkish advance, combined with their focus on internal conflicts, allowed the Turks to make significant gains. The text emphasizes the Rajput's lack of "strategic vision" and their failure to coordinate their response as key weaknesses.  The decentralized nature of Rajput power structures was a major contributing factor to their inability to effectively resist the Turkish advance.


**1. With reference to the Iqta System during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Siyasatnama served as a primary source of information regarding the Iqta system's implementation and functioning.
2.  Under the Iqta system, revenue collected was directly deposited into the Sultan's personal account, bypassing any intermediary.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Siyasatnama, a significant historical text, offers valuable insights into the administrative and revenue systems of the Delhi Sultanate, including detailed information on the Iqta system. It describes the principles, practices, and challenges associated with this land-revenue assignment system.  While other sources contribute to our understanding, the Siyasatnama provides a crucial primary source perspective.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Iqta system was not characterized by direct revenue deposition into the Sultan's personal account.  The revenue collected from an Iqta was primarily intended to fund the Muqti (military governor) in maintaining his troops and administrative expenses.  A portion, often a significant share, was remitted to the central treasury, but the system didn't involve direct, personal control by the Sultan over every single rupee. The auditing process, often harsh, aimed to ensure the central government received its due share.  This complex system involved multiple levels of accounting and financial oversight, far from a simple direct deposit model.  The system's evolution under rulers like Firuz Tughlaq further demonstrates the complexities beyond a straightforward personal account system.


**2. With reference to the administrative structure under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pargana, a sub-unit below the province, was directly administered by the Sultan's appointees, ensuring centralized control.
2.  The Chaurasi, a traditional grouping of villagers, formed the foundational unit upon which the Pargana's administrative structure was built.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Sultanate exerted overall control over the Pargana, direct administration wasn't solely through centrally appointed officials. The Pargana was headed by an Amil, whose authority and relationship to the central government varied over time and across different regions. Local power structures and existing social hierarchies played a significant role in the Pargana's governance. The level of centralized control was not absolute and often depended on the strength of the Sultan's authority and the efficiency of communication and enforcement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the grouping of villagers into units of 100 to 84 (Chaurasi), indicating this traditional structure served as a basis for the organization of Parganas.  This reflects the Sultanate's pragmatic approach, often building upon pre-existing village-level structures rather than imposing entirely new systems. The Chaurasi, as a pre-existing social and administrative unit, provided a framework upon which the Sultanate's revenue collection and basic administrative functions could be built. This reveals the Sultanate's strategy of incorporating and adapting existing local institutions to consolidate its power effectively.


**3. With reference to the economic conditions during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibn Battuta's detailed account provides extensive information about the economic lives of ordinary people during the 14th century.
2.  The cultivation of sesame, indigo, and cotton formed the basis of several village industries, including oil pressing, jaggery making, weaving, and dyeing.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ibn Battuta's account is a valuable source for understanding various aspects of 14th-century India, including its products and some aspects of daily life, it doesn't provide extensive detail on the economic lives of *ordinary* people.  His focus was largely on the court, trade routes, and prominent cities, offering a perspective primarily from an elite traveler's viewpoint.  Detailed economic data on peasant life, wages, and the overall distribution of wealth remain scarce from this period.

Statement 2 is correct.  The source text clearly states that sesame, indigo, and cotton were significant crops that supported village industries like oil pressing, jaggery production (from sugarcane), weaving (using cotton), and dyeing (using indigo).  These crops and the associated industries highlight the importance of agriculture and rural craft production in the economic structure of the Delhi Sultanate. Their presence indicates a diversified, largely agrarian economy with a significant role for village-based industries.  This illustrates the interconnectedness of agriculture and local manufacturing in sustaining the economy.


**4. With reference to the social structure during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The village headmen (mugaddams) and smaller landlords (khets) were primarily from the lower strata of society and enjoyed limited influence.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's policies aimed to curb the privileges and power of the prosperous landowners, including those who held land at concessional rates.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Mugaddams (village headmen) and khets (smaller landlords) were not from the lower strata of society. They were, in fact, a relatively prosperous section of the rural population, often owner-cultivators with significant influence within their villages.  They held land at concessional rates and held positions of power within the village panchayats. Their lifestyle, described as including expensive horses and fine clothes, suggests a higher standard of living compared to ordinary peasants.

Statement 2 is correct. Alauddin Khalji implemented policies specifically designed to reduce the power and privileges of wealthy landowners.  These policies aimed to curb their influence, redistribute resources, and consolidate the Sultan's control over the agrarian economy.  The text indicates that Khalji's actions were directed at curbing their privileges, indicating a deliberate attempt to reshape the power dynamics in the countryside.  This highlights his attempts at centralizing control and redistributing wealth.


**5. With reference to the trade and industry during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The introduction of the spinning wheel significantly improved the quality and speed of cotton textile production.
2.  Cambay was primarily known for its production of raw silk and fine cotton cloth (muslin).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text mentions that the introduction of the spinning wheel and the cotton carder's bow (dhunia) led to improvements in cotton cleaning and spinning, enhancing textile production.  These technological advancements played a crucial role in boosting the textile industry, a major component of the Sultanate's economy. The improvements are highlighted as crucial for enhancing productivity and efficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Cambay (Khambayat) was renowned for textiles and gold/silver work, not primarily for raw silk and muslin.  The text explicitly mentions Sonatgaon in Bengal as a center for raw silk and fine cotton cloth (muslin).  This distinction reveals the geographical specialization of production within the Sultanate's economy.  Different cities and regions focused on different products, reflecting the complexities of the economic landscape.


**6. With reference to the communication and infrastructure during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Muhammad Tughlaq's administration focused on improving existing roads rather than constructing new ones.
2.  A relay system using runners and towers facilitated rapid communication across the empire, including the transmission of fresh fruits from Khurasan.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Muhammad Tughlaq's reign saw significant investments in infrastructure, including road construction. The text explicitly mentions his construction of a new road to Daulatabad, alongside maintaining existing royal roads. This highlights his focus on improving communication and logistics within the empire. The construction of new roads, alongside the upkeep of existing ones, reveals a policy focused on both expansion and maintenance of infrastructure for effective governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The text describes an efficient relay system for communication, using runners and towers.  This system not only facilitated the swift transmission of messages but also the transport of perishable goods, such as fresh fruits from Khurasan, demonstrating the advanced logistical capabilities of the Sultanate. The example of transporting Ganga water to Daulatabad further illustrates the system's effectiveness and reach.  This shows how infrastructure and organization were used to enhance governance and maintain the lifestyle of the elite.


**7. With reference to the administrative practices of Firuz Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Tughlaq introduced a new land revenue system, completely replacing the existing methods.
2.  Firuz Tughlaq implemented policies that eased the harshness associated with the auditing of Iqta accounts.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Firuz Tughlaq did not introduce a completely new land revenue system.  While he implemented some reforms, he mainly worked within the existing framework, making adjustments rather than a total overhaul.  His focus was more on administrative and social reforms rather than a fundamental change in land revenue collection methodology. The continuity of existing practices demonstrates a more incremental approach to governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Firuz Tughlaq relaxed the harshness associated with the auditing of Iqta accounts, which often included torture and imprisonment of Muqtis. This shows a shift towards a less oppressive approach to financial administration. The relaxation of harsh auditing practices suggests a change in governance philosophy, moving away from extreme measures toward a possibly more moderate approach.  This reveals a nuanced aspect of his reign.


**8.  With reference to the economic activities in Bengal during the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's policies led to a decline in the importance of the Brahmaputra valley in Bengal's economy.
2.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's administration included several Hindu officials in high positions, including his Wazir.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Alauddin Hussain Shah's conquests, including the annexation of Kamata, actually expanded Bengal's control and influence over the Brahmaputra valley.  This expansion would have likely increased, not decreased, its economic importance within Bengal. The annexation of Kamata demonstrates an expansionist policy aimed at enhancing Bengal’s territory and influence, rather than a decline in the importance of the Brahmaputra valley.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that Alauddin Hussain Shah adopted a liberal policy, appointing Hindus to high offices.  His Wazir, chief physician, chief bodyguard, and master of the mint were all Hindus. This demonstrates a policy of religious tolerance and inclusion in governance. This policy of appointing Hindus to high positions reflects a less rigidly orthodox approach to governance and a recognition of the skills and capabilities of the Hindu population.


**9. With reference to the relations between Bengal and Orissa during the Sultanate period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ganga rulers of Orissa consistently supported the independent rulers of Bengal against external threats.
2.  The raids by Ilyas Shah and Firuz Tughlaq significantly weakened the prestige of the Ganga dynasty in Orissa.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between Bengal and Orissa was often characterized by conflict, not consistent mutual support.  While there might have been periods of temporary alliances or ceasefires, the overall dynamic was one of rivalry and competition for resources and territory.  The text indicates that Orissa sometimes aided Radha (south Bengal) but also engaged in conflicts with Bengal. This shows a complex and fluctuating relationship, not one of consistent mutual support.

Statement 2 is correct. The text indicates that the raids by Ilyas Shah and Firuz Tughlaq severely damaged the prestige of the Ganga dynasty. These raids, involving plunder and even the desecration of the Jagannatha temple, undermined their authority and contributed to the eventual rise of the Gajapati dynasty. The raids, which resulted in the loss of territory and prestige, contributed to the decline of the Ganga dynasty and the subsequent rise of the Gajapati dynasty.


**10. With reference to the Kingdom of Gujarat under Ahmad Shah I, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahmad Shah I shifted the capital from Ahmedabad to Patan to enhance its strategic importance.
2.  Despite his destruction of Hindu temples, Ahmad Shah I also appointed Hindus to high positions in his government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ahmad Shah I shifted the capital *from* Patan *to* the newly founded city of Ahmedabad.  This move reflects his ambition to establish a new center of power and administration. The shift of the capital reveals a policy of modernization and centralization of power, rather than a move to a strategically more important location.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that despite his actions against Hindu temples, Ahmad Shah I included Hindus in his government.  Manik Chand and Moti Chand, from the Bania community, served as ministers, demonstrating a degree of religious tolerance in administrative appointments.  The appointment of Hindu ministers indicates a pragmatic approach to governance, acknowledging the skills and capabilities of the Hindu population, despite religious differences.


**11. With reference to the Mughal administration under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Zabt system, introduced by Akbar, was a permanent and unchanging land revenue system.
2.  The Dahsala system, a refinement of the Zabt system, grouped parganas with similar productivity into assessment circles.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Zabt system, while a significant improvement, was not permanent or unchanging.  Akbar's administration retained the right to modify it as needed.  The system was adapted and refined over time, reflecting the dynamic nature of land revenue management. The text clearly states that the system was not permanent, emphasizing its adaptability to changing conditions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Dahsala system, a further development of the Zabt system, did indeed group parganas with similar productivity into assessment circles. This sophisticated approach aimed for a more equitable and efficient land revenue assessment.  The grouping of parganas with similar productivity demonstrates a systematic and refined approach to land revenue assessment, aiming for greater fairness and efficiency.  This shows a sophisticated understanding of land management.


**12. With reference to Akbar's Mansabdari system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mansab system under Akbar initially had only one rank, later evolving into a system with multiple ranks and categories.
2.  Under the Dagh system, every noble's horse was branded with imperial marks to ensure the quality of the cavalry.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Mansab system initially had a single rank, which was subsequently divided into multiple ranks and categories (zar and sawar) with further subdivisions into three categories within each rank. This evolution reflects the system's gradual development and refinement to meet the needs of the expanding empire. The evolution of the Mansab system from a single rank to a complex system of multiple ranks and categories reflects the growth and changing needs of the Mughal empire.

Statement 2 is correct. The Dagh system is accurately described as a method of ensuring the quality of the cavalry by branding the nobles' horses with imperial marks. This system helped maintain standards and prevent fraud in the recruitment and maintenance of cavalry contingents. The Dagh system highlights the attention to detail and the sophisticated mechanisms employed by the Mughal administration to maintain a strong and efficient military.


**13. With reference to the military organization during the reign of the three empires (Pratihara, Pala, and Rashtrakuta), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pratihara kings possessed a significant naval force and controlled major seaports along the western coast.
2.  The Pala infantry included soldiers from various regions of India, including Malwa, Khasa, Lata, and Karnataka.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions that the Pala and Rashtrakuta kings *might* have had navies, but provides no such information about the Pratiharas. The text focuses on the Pratihara's cavalry, not naval power.  The lack of information about Pratihara naval strength makes it impossible to confirm this statement, while the text explicitly mentions the Pala's possible naval power.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Pala infantry included soldiers from Malwa, Khasa (Assam), Lata (south Gujarat), and Karnataka, highlighting the multi-regional recruitment in their armies. This indicates a diverse and extensive recruitment network, drawing upon manpower from different parts of the subcontinent. The multi-regional recruitment of the Pala infantry reveals a sophisticated military organization, drawing upon manpower from across the subcontinent.


**14. With reference to the administrative structure of the three empires (Pratihara, Pala, and Rashtrakuta), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rashtrakuta kingdom's administrative structure was characterized by provinces (rashtra), districts (visayas), and smaller units (bhukti).
2.  The village headman and village accountant in all three empires held their positions through appointment by the central government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text accurately describes the Rashtrakuta administrative structure as consisting of provinces (rashtra), districts (visayas), and smaller units (bhukti), outlining their hierarchical organization. This reflects the complex administrative setup of a large empire. The description of the Rashtrakuta administrative structure highlights its sophisticated organization and the clear hierarchy within the system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the village headman and village accountant's positions were often hereditary, the text doesn't state that they were *always* appointed by the central government in all three empires.  Hereditary positions were common at the village level, reflecting the influence of local customs and power structures.  The text mentions hereditary positions at the village level, indicating that central government appointment was not always the case.


**15. With reference to the socio-religious aspects of the three empires (Pratihara, Pala, and Rashtrakuta), consider the following statements:**

1.  The rulers of these empires generally practiced religious tolerance and did not persecute followers of different faiths.
2.  The purohita (royal priest) held significant political power and often influenced the rulers' decisions on state matters.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the rulers generally practiced religious tolerance and did not persecute different faiths.  They often patronized various religious institutions, reflecting an inclusive approach.  The statement of religious tolerance highlights the inclusive nature of the governance in these empires.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the purohita advised the king on religious matters, the text emphasizes that the purohita did *not* dominate the king or interfere with state affairs.  The king's authority was derived from both Dharmaśāstras and Arthaśāstra, keeping religious and political spheres relatively distinct. The distinction between religious and political spheres highlights the relative independence of the rulers from the influence of their priests.


**16. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola Empire's rise was marked by the defeat of the Pallavas of Kanchi and the weakening of the Pandyas.
2.  Rajaraja I's military campaigns were primarily focused on consolidating internal power within the Chola territories.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the initial phase of the Chola Empire's expansion as involving the defeat of the Pallavas of Kanchi and the weakening of the Pandyas, setting the stage for their dominance in southern India. The defeat of the Pallavas and weakening of the Pandyas highlights the military prowess and expansionist policy of the Chola Empire.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Rajaraja I's campaigns extended far beyond internal consolidation.  The text mentions his conquests in Sri Lanka, attacks on the Cheras, and expansion into the Ganga kingdom in Karnataka.  These actions demonstrate a clear expansionist policy, not solely focused on internal stability.  The conquests in Sri Lanka and Karnataka indicate an expansionist policy extending beyond internal consolidation.


**17. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom under Mahmud Gawan, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms included the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each governed by a tarafdar.
2.  Mahmud Gawan focused primarily on military expansion and conquest, neglecting internal administrative reforms.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that Mahmud Gawan divided the Bahmani kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs) and appointed tarafdars to govern them, indicating a significant administrative reform.  This administrative reform shows a systematic approach to governance and the establishment of a clear hierarchical structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text highlights Mahmud Gawan's significant internal administrative reforms, including the establishment of a madrasa and the efforts to standardize salaries and land revenue collection.  While he was involved in military affairs, his focus wasn't solely on military expansion.  The emphasis on internal reforms shows a balanced approach to governance, combining military strength with internal administrative efficiency.


**18. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire under Krishna Deva Raya, consider the following statements:**

1.  Krishna Deva Raya's military campaigns resulted in the complete subjugation of Orissa and its integration into the Vijayanagara Empire.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya was a significant patron of Telugu and Sanskrit literature, producing works in both languages.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Krishna Deva Raya's military campaigns were successful against Orissa, leading to the restoration of Vijayanagara territories up to the Krishna River, it didn't result in the complete subjugation and integration of Orissa into the Vijayanagara Empire. Orissa remained a separate kingdom. The campaigns against Orissa resulted in the restoration of Vijayanagara territories, but did not lead to the complete subjugation of Orissa.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Krishna Deva Raya's patronage of Telugu and Sanskrit literature and his own literary contributions in both languages.  This highlights his role as a cultural patron and a significant figure in the literary landscape of the period.  His literary contributions and patronage highlight his role as a patron of the arts and a significant figure in the literary world.


**19. With reference to the later stages of the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Battle of Talikota (1565) marked the beginning of the Vijayanagara Empire's decline, leading to its eventual disintegration.
2.  Following the Battle of Talikota, the Vijayanagara kingdom continued to exist for several decades, but its power and influence significantly diminished.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Battle of Talikota is widely considered a pivotal event in the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, marking a turning point after which its power and territory diminished significantly. The Battle of Talikota is considered a watershed moment in the history of the Vijayanagara Empire, signifying the beginning of its decline.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text accurately notes that despite the defeat at Talikota, the Vijayanagara kingdom did continue for about a century, but with severely reduced power and influence in south India.  This reduced status demonstrates the long-term consequences of the battle.  The continued existence of the Vijayanagara kingdom after Talikota, albeit with reduced influence, demonstrates the resilience of the kingdom despite its military defeat.


**20. With reference to the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Akbar, Hindus constituted a significant portion of the Mughal nobility, with Rajputs forming the largest group.
2.  The Mughal nobility's lifestyle was characterized by frugality and avoidance of lavish spending.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text indicates that under Akbar, Hindus, particularly Rajputs, were increasingly included in the Mughal nobility, signifying a shift in the composition of the ruling class.  The inclusion of Hindus, especially Rajputs, in the Mughal nobility reflects a policy of integration and the recognition of the military and administrative skills of the Hindu population.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text describes the Mughal nobility's lifestyle as quite the opposite—lavish and ostentatious, with significant expenditure on various aspects of their lives, including clothing, food, and horses.  This description contrasts with the idea of frugality.  The description of the Mughal nobility's lifestyle highlights their extravagance and lavish spending habits, which are in contrast to the idea of frugality.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's expansion under Rajendra I, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the Chola control lasting for over a century.
2. The Chola armies, under Rajendra I, marched across Kalinga to Bengal, crossing the Ganga river and defeating local kings, leading to the adoption of the title "Gangaikondachola."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajendra I did conquer Sri Lanka and capture the king and queen's insignia, the Chola control over the island lasted for approximately 50 years, not over a century.  The statement misrepresents the duration of Chola influence in Sri Lanka, exaggerating the timeframe. This highlights the importance of precise temporal understanding in historical analysis.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's military campaign indeed extended to Bengal, involving a crossing of the Ganga river and victories over local rulers.  This significant military achievement directly led to his adoption of the title "Gangaikondachola," reflecting the geographical extent of his conquests and his ambition to control the Ganga river valley.  The statement accurately reflects a key event in the expansion of the Chola Empire under Rajendra I.  The successful expedition showcases the Chola military's capabilities and strategic reach beyond South India.


**2. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power and foreign relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola navy's dominance led to the Bay of Bengal being referred to as a "Chola lake" for an extended period, primarily due to their successful campaigns against the Srivijaya Empire.
2. Chola embassies to China were solely focused on diplomatic relations, with minimal commercial interaction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chola navy was indeed powerful, and their naval expeditions, particularly against the Srivijaya Empire, led to their control over significant maritime routes in the Bay of Bengal. This dominance resulted in the Bay of Bengal being described as a "Chola lake," signifying their naval supremacy and control over trade.  This demonstrates the Chola's mastery of naval warfare and its importance in their imperial strategy. The successful campaigns highlight the strategic use of naval power to expand influence and control trade routes.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Chola embassies to China had a diplomatic component, they were also significantly driven by commercial interests.  The text explicitly mentions Chola embassies involving merchants and trade of goods like glassware, camphor, and rhinoceros horns, in exchange for significant amounts of copper cash. This illustrates the multifaceted nature of Chola foreign policy, integrating diplomacy and commerce for mutual benefit.  The exchange of goods and the substantial financial returns highlight the economic dimension of Chola foreign relations.


**3. With reference to the Chola administrative system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola administration was entirely centralized, with little to no local self-governance.
2. The "sabha" or "mahasabha" were village assemblies primarily found in Brahman villages ("agraharams"), which enjoyed significant autonomy in managing local affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chola administration, while having a strong central authority vested in the king, also incorporated a significant degree of local self-governance, particularly in villages. The existence of village assemblies like the "ur" and "sabha" demonstrates a decentralized element within the broader administrative structure.  This highlights the Chola's pragmatic approach to governance, balancing central control with local autonomy for efficient administration.


Statement 2 is correct. The "sabha" or "mahasabha" were indeed village assemblies primarily found in Brahman villages known as "agraharams." These assemblies played a crucial role in managing village affairs, including land distribution, revenue collection, and maintenance of law and order.  Their significant autonomy demonstrates the sophistication of the Chola administrative system in delegating responsibilities to local bodies. The description of the Sabha's functions illustrates the level of self-governance and the efficient local administration.


**4. With reference to the later Chola period and its interactions with other powers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola empire maintained peaceful relations with the later Chalukyas, avoiding any significant conflicts.
2. The Chola empire's decline in the early 13th century was partly due to continuous warfare with the later Chalukyas, leading to exhaustion of both kingdoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chola empire did *not* maintain peaceful relations with the later Chalukyas.  The text clearly states that the Cholas and later Chalukyas engaged in constant warfare over territories like Vengi, the Tungabhadra doab, and parts of Karnataka.  These conflicts were significant, involving sacking of cities and massacres, indicating a hostile relationship, not peaceful coexistence.  The statement misrepresents the historical reality of conflict between the two powers.


Statement 2 is correct. The continuous wars with the later Chalukyas significantly contributed to the decline of the Chola empire. The prolonged conflicts exhausted the resources and manpower of both kingdoms, weakening them and making them vulnerable to other threats. This highlights the impact of prolonged warfare on imperial power and the importance of strategic alliances and conflict resolution in maintaining stability.  The statement accurately identifies a key factor in the Chola decline.


**5. With reference to the Chola cultural life and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola period saw the decline of the Bhakti movement.
2.  While magnificent Chola temples remain, none of their palaces have survived.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chola period witnessed the *further growth and climax* of the Bhakti movement, not its decline.  The text explicitly mentions the close link between the Bhakti movement and Chola temples, indicating a flourishing period for the movement during the Chola reign.  The statement contradicts the established historical understanding of the Bhakti movement's trajectory during the Chola period.


Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that while the Cholas built great capitals and magnificent temples (like the Brihadeeswarar Temple), none of their palaces have survived to the present day. This highlights the ephemeral nature of certain types of structures and the challenges in reconstructing historical urban landscapes.  The statement accurately reflects the archaeological evidence and the limitations of our understanding of Chola urban life.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer, a detailed explanation, and analysis of distractors.


**1. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule significantly advanced the Bengali language, fostering the flourishing of renowned Bengali writers.
2.  His administration was characterized by a strict adherence to Islamic law, leading to the persecution of Hindus and the suppression of their religious practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) was a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, with many famous Bengali writers flourishing under his rule.  This highlights his patronage of arts and literature and his contribution to the cultural landscape of Bengal.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the passage mentions the Muslim rulers of Bengal's attempts to control the Brahmaputra valley, it also emphasizes Alauddin Hussain Shah's liberal policies. He is described as adopting a liberal policy by offering high offices to Hindus, appointing a Hindu wazir, and showing respect to the Vaishnavite saint Chaitanya. This directly contradicts the assertion of strict adherence to Islamic law and persecution of Hindus. The passage portrays a more tolerant and inclusive approach to governance.  The inclusion of Hindus in high positions within his administration demonstrates a departure from strict religious orthodoxy.


**2. With reference to the political landscape of North-East India during the Sultanate period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom kingdom, though initially a Mongoloid tribe from North Burma, had become fully Islamized by the 13th century.
2.  The Sultan of Bengal, Alauddin Hussain Shah, successfully conquered and annexed both the Kamata and Ahom kingdoms to his empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the Ahoms, originating from North Burma, became *Hinduized* over time, not Islamized.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the religious dynamics of the region and the nature of the conflicts between the Ahoms and the Muslim rulers of Bengal.  The passage highlights the process of Hinduization as a significant aspect of Ahom history.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Alauddin Hussain Shah successfully annexed Kamata (Kamrup) to Bengal after an attack supported by the Ahoms, his subsequent attack on the Ahom kingdom was unsuccessful. The Ahom king, Suhungmung (Svarga Narayana), successfully repelled the Muslim attack and expanded his own kingdom. This demonstrates the resilience and military strength of the Ahom kingdom in resisting the expansionist ambitions of the Bengal Sultanate.


**3.  With reference to the reign of Ahmad Shah I of Gujarat, consider the following statements:**

1. Ahmad Shah I shifted the capital of Gujarat from Ahmedabad to Patan, reflecting a strategic shift towards the interior of the region.
2.  Despite his destruction of Hindu temples, Ahmad Shah I included Hindus in his government, showcasing a complex approach to religious policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that Ahmad Shah I *shifted the capital from Patan to the new city of Ahmedabad*, which he founded in 1413.  This demonstrates his focus on establishing a new administrative center and his contribution to urban development. The reversal of the information in the statement is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage acknowledges Ahmad Shah I's actions as a "bigot" in ordering the destruction of Hindu temples at Sidhpur. However, it immediately follows this by pointing out that he also inducted Hindus into his government, specifically mentioning Manik Chand and Motichand as ministers. This demonstrates a complex and potentially contradictory approach to religious policy, combining acts of religious intolerance with the inclusion of Hindus in key administrative positions.  This nuanced perspective is essential for a comprehensive understanding of his reign.


**4. With reference to the early Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's conquest of the Punjab was primarily motivated by his desire to secure a stable and wealthy base for operations against the Uzbeks, rather than purely expansionist ambitions.
2.  The Battle of Panipat (1526) was decisively won by Babur due to his superior cavalry tactics and his skillful use of elephants in the battle formation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage highlights Babur's motivations for seeking control of the Punjab. He explicitly mentions the meager income of Kabul and the need for a more secure and resource-rich base to counter the Uzbek threat.  This underscores the strategic and economic considerations behind Babur's Indian campaign, rather than a simple ambition for territorial expansion. The passage emphasizes the economic limitations of his existing territories and the strategic advantages of the Punjab.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Babur's victory at Panipat was decisive, the passage attributes his success to a combination of factors, including his innovative battlefield tactics (the use of the "Ottoman device" – a cart-based defensive formation), the effective use of artillery (guns), and the skill of his bowmen. The passage makes little reference to Ibrahim Lodi's elephants and emphasizes the effectiveness of Babur's artillery and defensive formations.  The statement misrepresents the key elements of Babur's military strategy.


**5. With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *wazir* under Muhammad Tughlaq primarily functioned as a military leader, directly commanding the Sultanate's armies.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's military reforms included the introduction of a cash-based salary system for soldiers, replacing the earlier practice of land assignments (*iqta*).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage describes the *wazir* under Muhammad Tughlaq as primarily an expert in revenue affairs, heading a large department managing income and expenditure.  While the *wazir* held significant administrative power, the Sultan himself retained direct command of the military forces.  The statement misrepresents the primary functions of the *wazir* during this period.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Alauddin Khalji abolished the land assignments (*iqta*) used for paying soldiers and introduced a cash-based salary system. This reform was a significant aspect of his military reorganization, aimed at improving the efficiency and loyalty of his army. The passage highlights the transition from land grants to a cash-based system as a key aspect of Alauddin's reforms.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Mongol invasions and their impact on the Delhi Sultanate:**

1.  The Mongol leader Changez Khan's decision not to invade India in 1221 was primarily due to his overwhelming military superiority over the Delhi Sultanate, rendering invasion unnecessary.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's military strategies and reforms effectively ended the Mongol threat to the Delhi Sultanate, resulting in the permanent expulsion of Mongol forces from India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Changez Khan's decision to not invade India in 1221 was due to his preoccupation with conquering the remaining parts of the Khwarizmi empire, not his perceived military superiority.  The Delhi Sultanate at that time was weak and disorganized, making a successful invasion a possibility. The passage emphasizes Changez Khan's focus on other territories as the reason for not invading India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Alauddin Khalji successfully repelled several Mongol incursions, he did not permanently end the Mongol threat.  The passage notes that the Mongol threat continued until the rise of Timur. The Mongol invasions posed a significant challenge to the Delhi Sultanate, and the threat persisted despite Alauddin Khalji's successes.  The statement exaggerates the lasting impact of Alauddin Khalji's actions.


**7. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's marriage alliances with Rajput rulers were primarily a strategic move to consolidate his power and secure the loyalty of powerful Rajput clans, rather than based on personal affection.
2.  The Battle of Haldighati (1576) resulted in a decisive Mughal victory, leading to the immediate submission of Rana Pratap and the complete annexation of Mewar.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage details Akbar's Rajput policy, highlighting the strategic use of matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers to integrate them into the Mughal empire. While personal relationships developed, the passage emphasizes the political and strategic dimensions of these marriages. The passage highlights the political motivations behind Akbar's alliances with Rajput rulers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Battle of Haldighati was not a decisive Mughal victory.  Although the Mughals gained some tactical advantages, Rana Pratap did not submit. He continued to resist Mughal rule through guerrilla warfare, and Mewar was not completely annexed. The passage emphasizes Rana Pratap's continued resistance even after Haldighati.  The statement misrepresents the outcome of the battle and its impact on Mewar.



**8. With reference to the economic and social life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate witnessed a flourishing urban economy, marked by the growth of major cities like Delhi, Daulatabad, and Cambay, driven primarily by agricultural surpluses and internal trade.
2.  The majority of the population during the Delhi Sultanate consisted of wealthy merchants and artisans, while the peasantry played a relatively minor role in the overall economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage describes the growth of major cities and the development of trade, both internal and external, during the Delhi Sultanate.  This indicates a flourishing urban economy, supported by agricultural production and commercial activity. The passage highlights the importance of trade and the growth of urban centers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage emphasizes that the peasantry formed the *overwhelming majority* of the population.  While wealthy merchants and artisans existed, their economic contributions were secondary to the vast agricultural sector, which sustained the Sultanate's economy. The statement misrepresents the demographic composition and economic importance of the peasantry.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a higher difficulty level by incorporating plausible distractors and requiring in-depth knowledge of the historical context.


**1. With reference to the economic policies of Alauddin Khalji, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's market control measures primarily aimed at curbing inflation and ensuring a steady supply of essential commodities to the army and urban population.
2. The land revenue system implemented by Alauddin Khalji in the Doab region involved direct state collection based on land measurement, eliminating intermediary collection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Alauddin Khalji's economic policies.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the primary goal of his market control measures. By fixing prices of essential goods, he aimed to control inflation and ensure the army's loyalty and the stability of urban centers.  His actions were a pragmatic response to the challenges of maintaining a large army and managing urban populations amid potential shortages. This was not solely about punishing any specific group, but about maintaining order and power.

Statement 2 is also correct, emphasizing the significant land revenue reforms in the Doab region.  The direct state collection, based on accurate land measurement, bypassed traditional intermediaries, allowing for more efficient revenue collection and a more equitable distribution of tax burdens. This system reduced the power of local elites who might have previously manipulated the system to their advantage.  While the implementation might have been harsh, the core principle was about efficient and direct state control.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the primary motives and mechanisms of Khalji's economic policies.


**2. With reference to the administrative structure during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pargana, a sub-unit below the Siq, was traditionally structured around units of 100 to 84 villagers (chaurasi), forming the basis of its administration.  The village accountant (Patwari) played a crucial role in revenue collection.
2.  The Muqti's responsibility included remitting the balance of income to the center after meeting expenditures.  The auditing process, though initially harsh, was later relaxed under Firuz Tughlaq.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately depict aspects of the Delhi Sultanate's administrative structure. Statement 1 correctly describes the hierarchical organization below the provincial level (Siq). The Pargana's administration, while not fully detailed in historical records, relied on traditional village groupings and the crucial role of the Patwari in revenue accounting.  This system, while seemingly basic, illustrates the Sultanate's attempt to integrate existing village structures into its administration, ensuring a degree of continuity and stability at the local level.

Statement 2 accurately describes the fiscal responsibilities of the Muqti and the evolution of the auditing process.  The Muqti's role involved managing local resources and remitting the surplus to the central treasury.  The auditing system, though initially characterized by harshness, underwent a significant change under Firuz Tughlaq, reflecting a shift in administrative practices. This evolution highlights the Sultanate's capacity for administrative adaptation and reform over time.  The other options incorrectly characterize the administrative structure or the evolution of fiscal policies.


**3. With reference to the economic and social life during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed insights into the economic conditions of ordinary people, including prices of commodities, agricultural practices, and village industries.
2. The overwhelming majority of the population consisted of peasants eking out a subsistence living, with recurring famines and wars exacerbating their hardships.  A prosperous section of owner-cultivators existed, dominating village panchayats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Ibn Battuta's account offers valuable information on various aspects of life during the Delhi Sultanate, statement 1 is an overstatement. His writings primarily focus on court life, trade and products, and travel experiences. Detailed information about the economic conditions of the common people is limited.  He provides some glimpses into agricultural practices, commodities, and trade routes, but lacks comprehensive data on the economic realities of the majority of the population.

Statement 2, however, is a more accurate reflection of the social and economic landscape. The vast majority of the population were peasants who struggled for subsistence.  Famines and wars were frequent, compounding their hardship. The existence of a more prosperous class of owner-cultivators who held significant influence within villages is also supported by historical evidence.  This statement accurately reflects the socio-economic stratification of the time.  The other options are incorrect as they misrepresent the scope and accuracy of Ibn Battuta's account and the broader socio-economic dynamics.


**4.  With reference to the agricultural policies of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's agrarian reforms involved raising land revenue to half the produce, forcing peasants to sell their surplus at controlled prices to ensure a steady supply of food grains to the urban centers and army.
2. Muhammad bin Tughlaq's agricultural experiments, though bold, were often hampered by poor planning, lack of experience, and opposition from vested interests, leading to several failures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of the agricultural policies of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad bin Tughlaq.  Statement 1 correctly summarizes Alauddin Khalji's agrarian policies, which aimed to ensure a stable food supply for the army and urban populations. By increasing land revenue and imposing price controls, he sought to manipulate the market to his advantage. His measures, though effective in the short term, had long-term consequences impacting the peasantry.

Statement 2 accurately describes the nature of Muhammad bin Tughlaq's agricultural experiments. His attempts at innovation and reform were often ambitious but poorly conceived or implemented.  He faced resistance from established interests, and several of his projects failed due to logistical problems, lack of administrative capacity, and socio-political factors.  His reign showcases both the potential for ambitious reform and the risks of implementing poorly planned policies.  The other options fail to capture the complexities of the agricultural policies and their respective outcomes under these two rulers.


**5. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Khalji, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's ruthlessness extended to the elimination of potential rivals, including the massacre of Mongols who had converted to Islam, and the harsh punishment of rebellious family members and nobles.
2.  The market control measures implemented by Alauddin Khalji, while intended to address economic challenges, also served the political purpose of consolidating his power by subjugating the nobility and preventing conspiracies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Alauddin Khalji's reign. Statement 1 correctly describes his ruthless methods of consolidating power. His actions demonstrate a willingness to use extreme measures to eliminate threats, irrespective of religious affiliation or family ties.  The massacre of the Mongol converts and the harsh treatment of rebels highlight his authoritarian approach to governance.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the dual purpose of his market controls. While addressing economic concerns such as inflation and food security, these policies also served a political function. By controlling prices and resources, he effectively diminished the economic and political influence of the nobility, reducing their capacity to challenge his authority. His actions showcase the intertwining of economic and political strategies in his quest for absolute power. The other options fail to fully capture the complex motivations behind Khalji's actions.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring in-depth knowledge of medieval Indian history.


**1. With reference to the Ghaznavid Empire and its impact on North India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's raids primarily aimed at establishing a permanent Muslim empire in India, evidenced by his seventeen invasions.
2. The Ghaznavid conquest of the Punjab and Multan significantly altered the political landscape of North India, making deeper incursions into the Gangetic plain feasible for subsequent Turkic invaders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahmud of Ghazni launched numerous raids into India, his primary motivation was plunder and wealth accumulation, not the establishment of a lasting empire.  The assertion that he invaded seventeen times is debated by historians; the exact number is uncertain. His actions were more opportunistic than part of a long-term strategic plan for conquest and rule.  The lack of sustained administrative structures or attempts at long-term governance in conquered territories supports this.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ghaznavid conquest of the Punjab and Multan marked a crucial turning point. It represented the breaching of the natural northwestern defenses of India. This strategic success paved the way for future Turkic invasions, as it demonstrated the vulnerability of the region and provided a foothold for subsequent incursions deeper into the Gangetic heartland.  The subsequent Delhi Sultanate built upon this foundation.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajput states in North India during the 11th and 12th centuries:**

1. The Chauhans of Ajmer, after initially serving under Gujarat rulers, established their dominance, culminating in Vigraharaja's capture of Delhi from the Tomars in 1151.
2. The Gahadavalas of Kanauj, under Govind Chandra, expanded their kingdom significantly, effectively pushing the Palas out of Bihar and earning recognition as a major power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate reflections of Rajput political dynamics during the specified period.  Statement 1 correctly outlines the Chauhans' rise to prominence, their service under Gujarat rulers, and Vigraharaja's strategic capture of Delhi (though he allowed the Tomars to remain as feudatories). This highlights the evolving power dynamics and the ambition of Rajput clans to assert their control over key territories.

Statement 2 similarly reflects the significant expansion of the Gahadavala kingdom under Govind Chandra.  His reign saw the extension of their control from Mongyr to Delhi, effectively pushing the Palas out of Bihar.  The description of Govind Chandra as "the greatest ruler of Hindustan" by contemporary Persian sources underscores his considerable influence and power.


**3. With reference to the architectural styles prevalent in North India during the period of Rajput rule (10th-12th centuries), consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara style of temple architecture, characterized by tall, curved spires (shikharas), was primarily confined to the western regions of North India, notably Gujarat and Rajasthan.
2. The Chandellas, known for their patronage of art and architecture, constructed magnificent temples showcasing the Nagara style, exemplified by the Khajuraho temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Nagara style was prevalent in western India, it was not confined to Gujarat and Rajasthan.  It was a widespread style across North India, with significant examples found in regions beyond the west. The statement misrepresents the geographical extent of the Nagara style's influence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chandellas are indeed renowned for their patronage of art and architecture, and the Khajuraho temples stand as a testament to their artistic achievements and the exquisite execution of the Nagara style.  The intricate carvings and the overall grandeur of these temples showcase the high point of sculpture and temple building during that era.  The statement accurately reflects this historical fact.


**4.  With reference to the reign of Mahmud Begarha (1459-1511) in Gujarat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Begarha's conquest of Girnar and Champaner primarily stemmed from his desire to control strategic locations for trade and suppress piracy in the Saurashtra region.
2.  Despite his reputation as a "great enemy of the infidels" for actions such as the destruction of Hindu temples at Sidhpur, Mahmud Begarha's administration included Hindu ministers and officials, showcasing a degree of religious tolerance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Mahmud Begarha's rule. Statement 1 highlights his strategic conquests. The capture of Girnar and Champaner were not solely driven by religious zeal.  Girnar provided control over Saurashtra, a wealthy region with important ports, while Champaner served as a strategic base for further expansion towards Malwa and Khandesh.  Suppressing piracy was also a key motive, enhancing trade and the security of the kingdom.

Statement 2 acknowledges the complex nature of Mahmud Begarha's religious policies. His actions at Sidhpur, and his overall reputation among medieval historians as an opponent of Hinduism, cannot be denied. However, the presence of Hindu ministers like Manik Chand and Moti Chand in his administration shows that religious affiliation did not always preclude political appointments.  This demonstrates a nuanced approach to governance, where pragmatic considerations sometimes overrode strict religious ideology.  His strict justice system, which even included the execution of his son-in-law, further complicates the narrative.



**5. With reference to the political situation in North India around 1525, consider the following statements:**

1.  The weakening of the Malwa Sultanate, marked by internal strife and conflicts with Mewar and Gujarat, created a power vacuum that facilitated the rise of Rana Sanga of Mewar as a dominant force.
2.  The defeat of Ibrahim Lodi by Rana Sanga at Khatoli significantly undermined the Lodi Sultanate's authority in the region, paving the way for Babur's invasion of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Malwa Sultanate's decline, fueled by internal conflicts and external pressures from Mewar and Gujarat, indeed created a power vacuum. Rana Sanga successfully exploited this situation, expanding Mewar's influence and becoming a major power in the region.  His victories against Mahmud II of Malwa further solidified his position.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rana Sanga was a powerful ruler, his victory at Khatoli against Ibrahim Lodi did not single-handedly pave the way for Babur's invasion.  The Lodi Sultanate's internal weaknesses, its existing conflicts with other regional powers, and Babur's own ambitions were all crucial factors leading to the Mughal conquest.  Attributing Babur's success solely to one battle oversimplifies a complex historical process.  The weakening of the Lodi Sultanate was a gradual process, involving several factors beyond Rana Sanga's victory.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.

**1. With reference to the reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule marked a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, with several famous Bengali writers flourishing during his time.
2.  His administration included high-ranking Hindu officials, such as his wazir, chief physician, and chief of the bodyguard, demonstrating a policy of religious tolerance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign (1493-1519) was a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, with prominent writers emerging during this time.  This directly supports statement 1.  Furthermore, the text highlights the sultan's appointment of Hindus to key administrative positions, including his wazir, chief physician, and head of the bodyguard.  This demonstrates a policy of religious tolerance and inclusion, thus validating statement 2.  Therefore, both statements are accurate reflections of Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule in Bengal. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements, which are clearly supported by the provided text.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Ahom kingdom and its relationship with the Bengal Sultanate:**

1. The Ahom kingdom, originally a Mongoloid tribe from North Burma, had become Hinduized by the 13th century and successfully repelled several attacks by the Bengal Sultanate.
2.  The city of Kamtapur (in modern Cooch Bihar) was annexed to Bengal after a joint attack by Alauddin Hussain Shah and the Ahoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 accurately describes the Ahom kingdom's origins, Hinduization, and successful defense against the Bengal Sultanate. The text clearly states their Mongoloid origins, their Hinduization, and their ability to repel multiple attacks.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While Alauddin Hussain Shah did conquer Kamtapur, it was *despite* Ahom support, not because of it.  The passage explicitly mentions that Alauddin's attack was supported by the Ahoms, leading to Kamtapur's destruction and annexation. This implies a conflict, not cooperation, between the two powers in this specific instance.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the historical relationship between the Ahom kingdom and the Bengal Sultanate concerning the conquest of Kamtapur.


**3. With reference to the political and religious landscape of Gujarat during the reign of Ahmad Shah I, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahmad Shah I shifted the capital from Patan to Ahmedabad, which he significantly developed with various architectural projects that blended Jain and Islamic styles.
2.  Despite his destruction of Hindu temples in Sidhpur, Ahmad Shah I included Hindus in his government, appointing members of the Bania community to ministerial positions, indicating a complex approach to religious policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly confirms that Ahmad Shah I moved the capital from Patan to Ahmedabad and undertook extensive construction projects, creating a unique architectural style that incorporated elements of both Jain and Islamic traditions. This supports statement 1.  Furthermore, the text details Ahmad Shah I's contradictory actions: while he destroyed Hindu temples in Sidhpur, he also appointed Hindu ministers from the Bania community, revealing a nuanced approach to governance that included both religious tolerance and intolerance. This corroborates statement 2. Hence, both statements accurately reflect aspects of Ahmad Shah I's rule in Gujarat. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the validity of both statements, which are clearly supported by the textual evidence.


**4. With reference to the reign of Mahmud Begarha in Gujarat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Begarha's conquest of Girnar and Champaner, two strategically important forts, solidified his control over Saurashtra and facilitated his ambitions towards Khandesh and Malwa.
2.  Mahmud Begarha's reign saw significant advancements in commerce and infrastructure, including the construction of caravan sarais and inns, despite his involvement in the destruction of Hindu temples such as those in Dwarka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly indicates that Mahmud Begarha's conquests of Girnar and Champaner were crucial for his control over Saurashtra and his strategic aims in Khandesh and Malwa. These conquests enhanced his power and influence in the region, aligning with statement 1.  Additionally, the text describes Mahmud Begarha's efforts to improve trade and infrastructure, exemplified by the construction of caravan sarais and inns, while also acknowledging his destruction of Hindu temples at Dwarka. This reflects a complex legacy that encompasses economic development alongside religious intolerance, thus supporting statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately portray aspects of Mahmud Begarha's reign. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the validity of both statements which are supported by the provided text.


**5.  With reference to the political dynamics of Malwa in the 15th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The strategic location of Malwa, situated on the plateau between the Narmada and Tapti rivers, made it a crucial region in the power struggles between Gujarat, Mewar, the Bahmanis, and the Lodi sultans of Delhi.
2.  While some Malwa rulers, such as Hushang Shah, displayed religious tolerance, Mahmud Khalji's reign was marked by the destruction of several Hindu temples during his conflicts with Rana Kumbha and other Hindu rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly establishes Malwa's geographical importance, situated between the Narmada and Tapti rivers, making it a key area in the power struggles among various kingdoms. This directly supports statement 1.  Moreover, the text highlights the contrasting religious policies of Malwa's rulers. While Hushang Shah promoted religious tolerance, Mahmud Khalji's actions involved the destruction of Hindu temples during his conflicts, showcasing the complex religious dynamics of the region. This validates statement 2. Consequently, both statements are accurate representations of Malwa's political and religious situation during the 15th century. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements, which are clearly supported by the textual evidence.

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that Rana Kumbha's reign was dominated by conflicts with Gujarat and Malwa, and also involved the Rathors of Marwar, illustrating the intricate power balance in Rajasthan. This directly supports statement 1.  Furthermore, the text highlights Rana Kumbha's intellectual pursuits, his authorship, and patronage of learned individuals, which contrasts with the violent conflicts of his reign and the destruction of temples under Mahmud Khalji. This supports statement 2, showcasing the multifaceted nature of his rule. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of Rana Kumbha's reign and his interactions with neighboring powers. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to appreciate the accuracy of both statements, which are clearly supported by the provided text.


**7. With reference to the Sharqi Sultanate of Jaunpur, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sharqi sultans, who established their capital at Jaunpur, developed a unique architectural style distinct from the Delhi style, marked by lofty gates and huge arches.
2.  Despite their ambition to conquer Delhi, the Sharqi Sultanate's influence extended across a significant territory, from Aligarh to Darbhanga, and they played a crucial role in preventing the expansion of the Bengal Sultanate into eastern Uttar Pradesh.

The text also highlights the Sharqi Sultanate's territorial reach and their successful resistance to the Bengal Sultanate's expansion into eastern Uttar Pradesh, showing their significant regional influence despite their unsuccessful attempts to conquer Delhi. This supports statement 2.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Sharqi Sultanate. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the validity of both statements, which are clearly supported by the provided text.


**8. With reference to the Lodi dynasty and its rule in the upper Ganga valley and Punjab, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lodi sultans, unlike their Turkic predecessors, were Afghans and their rise to power marked a shift in the demographic composition of the Muslim elite in North India.
2.  Sikandar Lodi's efforts to control powerful Afghan sardars and streamline the administration involved measures such as regular account submissions and harsh punishments for corruption, but his attempts to enforce strict adherence to Islamic law led to religious tensions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

However, it also notes his strict enforcement of Islamic law, creating religious tensions. This supports statement 2, highlighting the complex nature of his rule.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Lodi dynasty's reign.

1.  Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule marked a significant period for the growth of the Bengali language, fostering the flourishing of several famous Bengali writers.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign in Bengal.  Statement 1 highlights the significant contribution of his rule to the development and flourishing of the Bengali language and literature. The text explicitly mentions a "brilliant period" under his rule, where Bengali writers flourished. Statement 2 correctly points out his inclusive policies that saw Hindus appointed to key administrative and professional positions. The examples cited in the text (wazir, chief physician, master of the mint) directly support this.  Therefore, both statements are demonstrably correct based on the provided information. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements as presented.


**2. With reference to the political landscape of North Bengal and Assam during the reign of the Bengal Sultans, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ahom kingdom, a Mongoloid tribe from North Burma, had established a powerful kingdom in the 13th century and had become Hinduized by the time of Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign.
2.  Ilyas Shah's invasion of Kamata (Kamrup) resulted in the permanent annexation of Kamata to Bengal, with the Karatoya River becoming the undisputed northeastern boundary of Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states the Ahom kingdom's origins, its establishment in the 13th century, and its subsequent Hinduization.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ilyas Shah did invade Kamata and penetrated as far as Gauhati, the text explicitly states he *could not hold the area*, and the Karatoya River became a boundary *only temporarily*.  Later, under Alauddin Hussain Shah, Kamata was annexed, demonstrating the inaccuracy of statement 2 regarding Ilyas Shah's lasting impact on the border.  Thus, only statement 1 is entirely accurate according to the provided information.


**3. With reference to the architectural style prevalent during the reign of Ahmad Shah I in Gujarat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahmad Shah I's architectural style, drawing inspiration from the Jains of Gujarat, was characterized by sturdy, imposing structures with grand, ornate facades.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ahmad Shah I did indeed draw inspiration from Jain architectural traditions, the description of his style as "sturdy, imposing structures with grand, ornate facades" is an oversimplification and potentially misleading. The text emphasizes *slender turrets* and *exquisite stone carving*, which are features of elegance and delicacy, not necessarily of imposing scale. Statement 2 is correct. The Jama Masjid and Tin Darwaza are explicitly mentioned as examples of the architectural style of Ahmad Shah I's reign, and their features are accurately described.  Therefore, only statement 2 is fully supported by the given text.


**4. With reference to the religious policies of Ahmad Shah I of Gujarat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahmad Shah I's religious policies were consistently characterized by tolerance and inclusivity, as evidenced by his appointment of Hindu ministers like Manik Chand and Motichand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements offer a nuanced perspective on Ahmad Shah I's religious policies. Statement 1 correctly points out his inclusion of Hindu ministers in his government, highlighting a degree of religious tolerance.  However, statement 1 presents an incomplete picture. Statement 2 correctly adds crucial context, acknowledging the contradictory nature of his actions.  While he employed Hindus, he also destroyed temples at Sidhpur.  The “truth, however, appears to be more complex,” as the text notes.  Both statements are true but present contrasting aspects of his policies, demonstrating a complex reality often overlooked in simpler interpretations of historical figures.


**5. With reference to Mahmud Begarha’s reign in Gujarat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Begarha's long reign (over 50 years) focused primarily on internal consolidation rather than significant territorial expansion.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Mahmud Begarha's successors *continued* Ahmad Shah I's policy of "expansion and consolidation." This directly contradicts the assertion that Mahmud Begarha focused primarily on internal consolidation. Statement 2 is correct, aligning with the text's clear statement about the continuation of expansionist and consolidation policies under Mahmud Begarha.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the information provided.


**6. With reference to the Rajput states in North India around 1200 AD, consider the following statements:**

The text states that some of the finest works in Hindi, such as Malik Muhammad Jayasi's Padmavat, were *completed* during Sher Shah Suri's reign—indicating a flourishing, not a decline, in Hindi literature. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that Akbar did *not* insist on matrimonial alliances as a precondition for Rajput submission.  He formed alliances with some Rajput rulers through marriage, but others submitted without such alliances.  Statement 2 is correct.  Akbar's religious tolerance is explicitly linked to the abolition of the jizya tax and the end of forced conversions. Thus, only statement 2 is accurate.

This directly supports statement 1. The text further emphasizes that this period was exceptionally important for the growth and development of the Bengali language, fostering the careers of several prominent Bengali writers. This validates statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of Alauddin Hussain Shah's rule in Bengal. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially represent the historical evidence. Option (d) is incorrect as the text substantiates both statements.  The question tests factual recall about a less-frequently discussed aspect of Bengal's history, requiring specific knowledge of Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign and its impact on both governance and linguistic development.

While Ilyas Shah did raid Orissa and reached the Chilka Lake, the passage doesn't claim a complete conquest of Orissa.  His raid, while successful in securing booty, did not result in lasting territorial control. The text highlights that the Ganga dynasty's prestige was diminished by these raids but not completely overthrown. The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the extent of Ilyas Shah's success in Orissa or incorrectly link the construction of the temples to a different dynasty or event.  This question evaluates the ability to differentiate between a successful raid and a full-scale conquest and tests knowledge of regional architectural patronage.

The text also details Ahmad Shah's patronage of architecture, highlighting a distinct style influenced by Jain traditions, characterized by specific architectural features exemplified by the Jama Masjid in Ahmedabad. This validates statement 2. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as both statements are supported by the passage.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text details Muhammad bin Tughlaq's unsuccessful attempt to move the capital from Delhi to Deogir (renamed Daulatabad), highlighting the hardships faced by the populace and the resulting widespread dissatisfaction. This corroborates statement 1. The passage also describes the failure of his token currency experiment, primarily due to rampant counterfeiting and the public's reluctance to accept the new currency. This confirms statement 2.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, failing to recognize the textual support for both policy failures. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are validated by the passage, revealing the shortcomings of two major policy decisions made during Muhammad bin Tughlaq's reign.

1.  The Jat uprisings, primarily involving peasant cultivators, were driven by issues related to land revenue collection and resulted in the eventual establishment of a separate Jat principality.
2.  The Afghan uprisings, characterized by tribal conflicts, were largely devoid of any religious or nationalist sentiment aimed at establishing an independent Afghan state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text describes the Jat uprisings as having roots in land revenue disputes and ultimately culminating in the formation of an independent Jat state. This supports statement 1.  However, statement 2 is inaccurate. The passage indicates that the Afghan uprisings, while rooted in tribal conflicts, also involved aspirations for a separate Afghan state, and were influenced by religious and revivalist movements like the Raushanai. Therefore, statement 2 misrepresents the nature of the Afghan uprisings. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either fail to accurately reflect the outcome of the Jat uprisings or mischaracterize the motivations behind the Afghan uprisings.  This question assesses the understanding of the diverse factors driving regional resistance within the Mughal Empire and the ability to critically evaluate historical interpretations.


**9. With reference to the Bahmani kingdom and its disintegration, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan, a prominent figure in the Bahmani kingdom, implemented significant administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces and a standardized system for noble salaries and jagirs.
2.  The disintegration of the Bahmani kingdom resulted in the formation of five independent sultanates, with Golconda, Bijapur, and Ahmadnagar playing particularly significant roles in Deccan politics.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage details Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs) and the establishment of a structured system for noble salaries and jagirs. This validates statement 1.  The text further describes the fragmentation of the Bahmani kingdom into five successor states, with Golconda, Bijapur, and Ahmadnagar emerging as key players in Deccan politics.  This confirms statement 2. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, as both statements are supported by the passage's account of the Bahmani kingdom. Option (d) is incorrect because the passage directly supports both statements, showing Mahmud Gawan's administrative legacy and the political consequences of the Bahmani kingdom's collapse. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the administrative and political structures of the Bahmani kingdom and its successor states.


**10. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire under Krishna Deva Raya (1509-1530), consider the following statements:**

1.  Krishna Deva Raya's military victories included the defeat of the Bijapur Sultanate and the recovery of territories lost to Orissa, solidifying Vijayanagara's position as the dominant power in the south.
2.  Despite his military prowess, Krishna Deva Raya neglected naval development, unlike some earlier Vijayanagara rulers, which proved to be a strategic disadvantage in the face of growing Portuguese power.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage describes Krishna Deva Raya's significant military achievements, including victories against Bijapur and the reclamation of territories from Orissa, establishing Vijayanagara's dominance in the south. This supports statement 1. The text also notes Krishna Deva Raya's relative lack of focus on naval development compared to his predecessors, highlighting this as a potential weakness in the face of Portuguese expansion. This validates statement 2.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, missing the textual support for both aspects of Krishna Deva Raya's reign. Option (d) is incorrect because the passage provides evidence for both Krishna Deva Raya's military successes and his neglect of naval power, revealing both strengths and weaknesses of his rule. This question assesses the ability to analyze a ruler's strengths and weaknesses and understand the context of regional power dynamics.


**1. With reference to Muhammad Tughlaq's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  The transfer of capital from Delhi to Daulatabad primarily aimed to establish better control over the Deccan and Gujarat regions.
2.  The introduction of token currency, while inspired by similar experiments in China and Iran, ultimately failed due to widespread counterfeiting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Muhammad Tughlaq's motivations for shifting the capital were multifaceted, including improved access to western and southern ports and protection from Mongol invasions, the primary aim was to consolidate control over the strategically crucial Deccan and Gujarat regions, which were experiencing unrest and challenges to Delhi's authority.  The move was an attempt to establish a stronger presence in these areas and curb the ambitions of rebellious nobles.

Statement 2 is also correct. Muhammad Tughlaq's introduction of a token currency system, mirroring similar attempts by Qublai Khan in China and Ghazan Khan in Iran, ultimately proved disastrous. The inherent weakness of the system lay in the government's inability to prevent widespread counterfeiting. The lack of sufficient control over the minting process and the circulation of the bronze coins led to a rapid devaluation and a subsequent economic crisis.  The experiment highlighted the difficulties of implementing such radical economic changes in a society lacking the infrastructure and public trust necessary for its success.  This failure significantly damaged Tughlaq's reputation and contributed to the instability of his reign.


**2. With reference to the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1.  The proportion of Hindus in the Mughal nobility remained consistently low throughout Akbar's reign, never exceeding 20%.
2.  The Mughal mansabdari system, while initially designed to create a meritocratic structure, evolved to become increasingly hereditary and less reliant on military service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the initial percentage of Hindus in the Mughal nobility under Akbar was relatively low, it gradually increased over time.  Although figures vary depending on the source and year, the assertion that it *never* exceeded 20% is inaccurate. The inclusion of Rajput elites, along with other Hindu groups, led to a significant rise in their representation within the nobility, particularly during the reigns of later Mughal emperors.  The statement misrepresents the gradual but significant shift in the composition of the Mughal nobility.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mughal mansabdari system, while initially intended to be a merit-based system that prioritized military capability and loyalty, progressively developed hereditary characteristics.  Over time, the system became increasingly entrenched, with positions and ranks becoming more associated with lineage and family connections rather than solely on merit.  This evolution was a result of various factors, including the growing influence of powerful families and the challenges of maintaining a large and efficient army based purely on meritocratic principles. This shift contributed to the complexities and eventual decline of the Mughal administrative system.


**3. With reference to the economic policies of Alauddin Khalji, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Khalji's land revenue reforms primarily aimed at strengthening the relationship with rural areas, and some of these measures were adopted by later rulers.
2.  His stringent market regulations were solely aimed at controlling inflation and ensuring the availability of essential goods for the common people.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Alauddin Khalji's land revenue reforms represented a significant step towards a more structured and centralized system, fostering closer ties with rural populations. Although driven by the need to strengthen the state's financial position, these reforms also had the effect of improving the relationship between the rulers and the peasantry.  Elements of these reforms were later adopted and adapted by rulers such as Sher Shah Suri and Akbar, indicating their enduring influence on subsequent agrarian policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Alauddin Khalji's market regulations did contribute to controlling inflation and ensuring the availability of essential goods, their primary purpose was to secure a steady supply of provisions for his large standing army at controlled prices.  The regulations, which included price controls and the regulation of wages, were primarily motivated by military necessities and the needs of the state.  While the common people benefitted from the availability of goods, it was a secondary effect rather than the sole intention. The regulations also served to suppress the power of merchants and traders.


**4. With reference to the reign of Jahangir, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jahangir's early reign was marked by the immediate and successful suppression of Khusrau's rebellion, securing his position as emperor without further challenges.
2.  Islam Khan's governorship of Bengal was instrumental in pacifying the region, effectively ending the persistent Afghan resistance and integrating the area into the Mughal empire.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Jahangir did defeat Khusrau's rebellion, it was not immediate or without further challenges.  Khusrau's rebellion posed a significant threat to Jahangir's early reign, requiring military action and subsequently leading to Khusrau's imprisonment. The succession struggle within the Mughal royal family continued to be a source of instability even after the initial suppression of Khusrau's rebellion.

Statement 2 is correct. Islam Khan's governorship of Bengal was a period of significant consolidation and pacification. He skillfully dealt with the persistent Afghan resistance, strategically securing key areas like Sonargaon and Dacca.  His approach combined military action with diplomatic initiatives to win over local zamindars.  His success in Bengal effectively integrated the region into the Mughal empire, establishing a lasting peace and laying the foundation for the region's future prosperity.  This achievement is a notable example of effective governance and administration during Jahangir's reign.


**5. With reference to Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. The crisis in the jagirdari system during Aurangzeb's reign stemmed primarily from a shortage of jagirs, exacerbated by the annexations in the Deccan and a virtual ban on new recruitment.
2. Aurangzeb's failure to integrate the Marathas into the Mughal political system was solely due to his distrust of Maratha sardars, preventing them from accessing positions of trust and responsibility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The jagirdari system faced a profound crisis during Aurangzeb's reign, largely due to a shortage of suitable jagirs.  The annexations in the Deccan, while expanding the empire's territory, did not immediately translate into readily available and productive jagirs. Aurangzeb's policy of limiting new recruitment further aggravated the problem, creating intense competition for available assignments and fueling discontent among the nobility. The lack of sufficient jagirs to meet the demands of the existing and aspiring mansabdars was a major factor contributing to the weakening of the Mughal administrative system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb's distrust of Maratha sardars certainly played a role in their limited integration into the Mughal system, it was not the sole factor.  Other factors contributed significantly, including the inherent differences in political culture and ambitions between the Mughals and the Marathas, the ongoing conflict, and the Marathas' unique guerilla warfare strategies.  The failure to integrate the Marathas was a complex issue with multiple contributing factors, and attributing it solely to Aurangzeb's distrust is an oversimplification.  The complex political dynamics and military strategies employed by the Marathas presented a unique challenge to the Mughal system of integration.


**1. With reference to Babur's early campaigns in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Babur's initial incursions into India were primarily motivated by the meager resources of Kabul and the threat of Uzbek attacks.
2.  Daulat Khan Lodi, the governor of Punjab, consistently supported Babur's ambitions, providing crucial military assistance in the conquest of the Punjab.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that Babur's conquest of Punjab was driven by the insufficient revenue from Kabul and the fear of Uzbek invasions.  Kabul's economic limitations and the security threat from the Uzbeks are presented as key factors prompting Babur's expansionist policy towards India.  This aligns with established historical understanding of Babur's motivations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Daulat Khan Lodi's allegiance was highly volatile and opportunistic. While he initially invited Babur to India to counter Ibrahim Lodi, he later switched sides, attempting to oust Babur's forces from Sialkot. This demonstrates Daulat Khan's self-serving nature and lack of consistent support for Babur's ambitions. His actions highlight the complex political landscape of the time and the shifting alliances among the Afghan chiefs.  Daulat Khan's behavior exemplifies the instability and power struggles that characterized the pre-Mughal period in India.


**2. With reference to the Battle of Panipat (1526), consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibrahim Lodi's army significantly outnumbered Babur's forces, possessing a considerable advantage in terms of manpower and elephants.
2.  Babur's victory was primarily attributed to his superior cavalry tactics, which overwhelmed Ibrahim Lodi's larger army through swift maneuvers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly indicates that Ibrahim Lodi's army was far larger than Babur's, comprising an estimated 100,000 men and 1000 elephants.  While the actual number of fighting men might have been lower due to the inclusion of numerous servants, the numerical superiority of Ibrahim Lodi's forces is undeniable. This disparity underscores the strategic challenges faced by Babur and highlights his tactical brilliance in overcoming this disadvantage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although Babur's army used innovative tactics, including the Ottoman-style cart formation and effective use of gunpowder, the text emphasizes the crucial role of his bowmen in securing victory.  Babur himself gives more credit to his bowmen than to any other aspect of his military strategy.  While superior tactics certainly contributed to the outcome, to solely attribute the win to cavalry maneuvers would be an oversimplification of a complex battle.  The combined use of artillery, infantry, and bowmen, along with strategic positioning, is what secured Babur's victory.


**3. With reference to the Battle of Khanwa (1527), consider the following statements:**

1.  Rana Sanga's alliance included a substantial contingent of Afghan troops, aiming to restore Afghan rule in Delhi.
2.  Babur's declaration of a jihad, coupled with his public renunciation of alcohol, significantly boosted the morale of his troops before the battle.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that many Afghans, including Mahmud Lodi (Ibrahim Lodi's brother), joined Rana Sanga's forces, hoping to reclaim the Delhi throne if Sanga won.  This alliance represented a significant coalition against Babur, combining Rajput and Afghan forces. The presence of Afghan troops highlights the political complexities and shifting alliances that characterized the period.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text describes Babur's efforts to bolster his troops' morale before the Battle of Khanwa. He declared the war a jihad, a religious war, and publicly demonstrated his commitment to Islam by destroying his wine supplies and banning alcohol.  This action, aimed at strengthening religious fervor, was a crucial element in rallying his troops and countering the demoralizing effect of Rana Sanga's early successes. This aspect of Babur's leadership showcases the importance of religious and psychological factors in warfare.


**4. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's policy primarily relied on matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers to secure their loyalty and cooperation.
2.  The Hadas of Ranthambhor, despite their refusal to enter into matrimonial alliances with Akbar, remained high in his favor due to their military prowess.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Akbar's Rajput policy extensively used matrimonial alliances as a key strategy to integrate Rajput elites into the Mughal empire.  The marriage of his daughter to Bhara Mal, the ruler of Amber, is a prime example.  These alliances were not merely symbolic; they created strong personal ties and political bonds, contributing to the relative peace and stability of the Mughal empire during Akbar's reign.  This illustrates Akbar's pragmatic approach to consolidating his power.

Statement 2 is correct. The text itself states that no matrimonial alliances were formed with the Hadas of Ranthambhor, yet they remained highly regarded by Akbar. This demonstrates that Akbar's approach was not solely dependent on marriage but also considered other factors such as military capability and political expediency. The case of the Hadas exemplifies the flexibility and pragmatism of Akbar's policies.  It showcases his ability to forge alliances based on mutual benefit and strategic considerations beyond kinship ties.


**5. With reference to Muhammad Tughlaq's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  The shift of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad was primarily driven by a desire to improve control over south India and quell rebellions in the region.
2.  The introduction of token currency proved successful, significantly boosting the economy and easing financial difficulties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explains that Muhammad Tughlaq's decision to move the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (Deogir) was motivated by his attempts to better manage the southern regions of his empire, which were experiencing significant unrest and rebellions.  The move aimed to bring the south under tighter control and suppress the ongoing revolts. This decision, while ultimately unsuccessful, reflects his ambition to consolidate his power across the vast empire.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The introduction of the token currency is presented as one of Muhammad Tughlaq's failed experiments. The text highlights the difficulties in getting the public to accept the new currency and the issue of widespread counterfeiting, ultimately leading to its devaluation and withdrawal.  The failure of this policy demonstrates the challenges of implementing large-scale economic reforms without proper planning and effective implementation mechanisms.  It serves as a cautionary tale in the study of economic policies.


**6. With reference to the policies of Firuz Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1. Firuz Tughlaq's policy of making offices and iqtas hereditary led to improved efficiency and reduced rebellions among the nobles.
2.  Firuz Tughlaq's military reforms, including the payment of soldiers through land assignments, strengthened the Sultanate's military capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Firuz Tughlaq's policy of making offices and iqtas hereditary initially appeased the nobility, leading to a period of relative peace, the long-term consequences were detrimental. It resulted in the stagnation of talent and promoted a narrow oligarchy, ultimately weakening the Sultanate's administrative efficiency and potentially contributing to its decline.  This highlights the unintended consequences of seemingly well-intentioned policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Firuz Tughlaq's method of paying soldiers through land assignments, while seemingly generous, created significant problems.  It led to laxity in military administration, corruption, and decreased military effectiveness. Soldiers either neglected their duties to collect payments or relied on intermediaries, weakening the Sultanate's military strength. This illustrates the unintended negative effects of poorly implemented reforms.


**7. With reference to Alauddin Khalji's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's land revenue reforms aimed to significantly reduce the power of village headmen (khets and muqaddams).
2. Alauddin Khalji's military reforms, including the creation of a large and efficient cavalry, were instrumental in repelling subsequent Mongol invasions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Alauddin Khalji did implement significant land revenue reforms, his primary goal was not to reduce the power of village headmen. His aim was to ensure an adequate share of revenue for the state, and his methods were more focused on efficient tax collection rather than undermining the authority of local leaders. This shows a focus on centralized revenue control rather than decentralization of power.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Alauddin Khalji's military reforms, particularly the creation of a large and efficient cavalry, enabled him to successfully defeat subsequent Mongol attacks, driving them beyond the Indus. These reforms were crucial in ensuring the security of the Sultanate and demonstrate his strategic military acumen.  This highlights the importance of military strength in maintaining a large empire.


**8.  With reference to Sikandar Lodi's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Sikandar Lodi's policies actively promoted cultural rapprochement between Hindus and Muslims through the translation of Sanskrit works into Persian.
2. The founding of Agra as a city was primarily intended to serve as a military base to control eastern Rajasthan and the routes to Malwa and Gujarat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text highlights Sikandar Lodi's patronage of scholars and his initiative to translate several Sanskrit works into Persian. This act fostered cultural exchange and understanding between the Hindu and Muslim communities, contributing to a period of relative harmony.  This demonstrates a policy of cultural integration rather than strict religious segregation.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Sikandar Lodi selected the site for Agra strategically to control eastern Rajasthan and the vital trade routes to Malwa and Gujarat.  This decision reflects a pragmatic approach to consolidating his power and securing important trade networks. The choice of location underscores the importance of strategic planning in establishing a strong and stable kingdom.


**9. With reference to the Kingdom of Kashmir in the 15th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reign of Sikandar Shah (1389-1413) witnessed the persecution of Brahmans and the widespread destruction of Hindu temples.
2.  Zain-ul-Abidin's rule marked a period of religious tolerance, with the restoration of Hindu temples and the reinstatement of Hindus in high government offices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text clearly describes the harsh policies of Sikandar Shah, including the persecution of Brahmans, the destruction of Hindu temples, and the forced conversion of Hindus to Islam. This period represents a significant setback for religious harmony in Kashmir. This showcases the impact of religious policies on social dynamics.

Statement 2 is correct. The text portrays Zain-ul-Abidin as a ruler who reversed the policies of his predecessors, promoting religious tolerance and restoring Hindu temples and the rights of Hindus.  He reinstated Hindus in government positions, creating a more inclusive atmosphere.  This period of religious tolerance contrasts sharply with the previous reign and highlights the significant impact of leadership on societal attitudes.


**10. With reference to the early Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Iltutmish's consolidation of power involved overcoming challenges from regional rulers in Bengal and Multan, as well as regaining control over territories lost to the Rajputs.
2.  Razia Sultan's rule was characterized by her decisive military leadership and her successful efforts to maintain control against rebellious Turkish nobles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text details Iltutmish's struggles to consolidate the Delhi Sultanate, facing challenges from independent rulers in Bengal (Ali Mardan Khan) and Multan (Qubacha) and regaining control of territories lost to Rajput rulers after Aibak's death.  These challenges highlight the difficulties in establishing and maintaining a unified empire in early medieval India.

Statement 2 is partially correct but ultimately misleading. While Razia Sultan did display strong leadership qualities and initially suppressed rebellions, her rule was ultimately short-lived and ended with her assassination.  Her attempts to challenge the power of the established Turkish nobles, while demonstrating strong leadership, ultimately failed to prevent her overthrow and death.  This highlights the limitations even strong rulers faced in the face of entrenched power structures.  The statement overstates her long-term success.


**1. With reference to the administrative structure during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *amil* headed the *pargana*, a unit below the province, while villages were grouped into units of 100 to 84, traditionally called *chaurasi*.
2.  The *muqti*, responsible for remitting the balance of income after meeting expenditures, faced harsh auditing processes, including torture, which were later relaxed by Firuz Tughlaq.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the administrative hierarchy within the Delhi Sultanate.  The *pargana*, a sub-provincial unit, was headed by an *amil*. Villages were organized into groups, often numbering around 100 or 84 (*chaurasi*), forming the base of the *pargana* system. This reflects the decentralized nature of administration at the local level, with limited interference as long as land revenue was paid.

Statement 2 correctly outlines the role of the *muqti* and the evolution of the auditing system.  The *muqti* was a revenue official responsible for collecting revenue from assigned territories (*iqta*) and remitting the surplus to the central government. However, the auditing process was often rigorous and harsh, involving punishments like torture and imprisonment.  Firuz Tughlaq, towards the end of the Sultanate period, implemented reforms to mitigate the severity of these practices, indicating a shift towards a more lenient approach.  This demonstrates a significant administrative change during the Sultanate's later phase.


**2. With reference to the economic and social life under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. Ibn Battuta's account provides detailed information about the economic condition of ordinary people during the reign of Muhammad Tughlaq.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's agrarian reforms aimed to reduce the power of *khets* and *mugaddams* by making them pay taxes similar to ordinary cultivators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ibn Battuta's account offers valuable insights into various aspects of life under Muhammad Tughlaq, including products, roads, and the lives of some people, it doesn't provide extensive details on the economic conditions of the majority of the population. The focus is more on court life and observations of specific regions he visited.  The lack of comprehensive data on the general economic condition of ordinary people limits the scope of his account in this specific area.

Statement 2 is correct. Alauddin Khalji's agrarian reforms aimed at restructuring land revenue collection and reducing the power of the landed gentry (*khets* and *mugaddams*).  He implemented measures forcing these wealthy landowners to pay taxes on a par with ordinary cultivators, effectively curtailing their privileges and ensuring a larger share of revenue for the state. This policy, though harsh, was a significant attempt to redistribute economic power and enhance state control over agricultural production.


**3. With reference to agricultural policies during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Muhammad Tughlaq's agrarian reforms, implemented in the Doab region, focused on extending cultivation by providing loans to cultivators and encouraging the growth of superior crops.
2.  Firuz Tughlaq's policies, unlike Muhammad Tughlaq’s, emphasized the hereditary nature of land ownership and revenue collection, thereby reducing the efficiency of the system.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Muhammad Tughlaq's agricultural policies.  He implemented ambitious schemes in the Doab region aiming to improve agricultural productivity.  These involved establishing a separate department (*diwan-i-amir-i-kohi*), providing loans to cultivators, and encouraging the cultivation of higher-yielding crops like wheat and sugarcane. Although these reforms ultimately failed due to various factors including corruption, the intent and the nature of these initiatives are accurately depicted.

Statement 2 correctly highlights a key contrast between Firuz Tughlaq's and Muhammad Tughlaq's approaches to land revenue. While Muhammad Tughlaq focused on direct state control and revenue collection, Firuz Tughlaq's policies leaned towards making land-related offices and *iqta* hereditary. While this appeased the nobility, it created inefficiencies and reduced the chances of recruiting competent individuals outside a narrow circle, impacting the overall efficiency of the revenue system. The hereditary nature of these positions ultimately hampered the system's effectiveness.


**4. With reference to the economic conditions under the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The introduction of the silver *tanka* and copper *dirham* led to a significant growth of trade and the flourishing of urban economies during the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The prices of essential commodities, such as grains, remained consistently low throughout the Sultanate period, ensuring the support of citizens and the army.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The establishment of a sound currency system based on the silver *tanka* and copper *dirham* played a crucial role in the economic growth of the Delhi Sultanate. This stable currency facilitated trade and commerce, leading to the expansion of towns and urban centers. The improved infrastructure and economic activity fostered a relatively prosperous urban economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While there were periods of low prices for essential commodities, particularly under Alauddin Khalji's market control measures, prices fluctuated throughout the Sultanate period.  Famines and other factors influenced price levels, leading to periods of both low and high prices for food grains.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate picture of the consistent affordability of essential goods.


**5. With reference to the social structure during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. The overwhelming majority of the population consisted of peasants, many of whom lived at a subsistence level, facing hardships due to recurring famines and wars.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's policies significantly improved the living conditions of all peasants, leading to widespread prosperity in rural areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the social reality of the Delhi Sultanate. Peasants formed the vast majority of the population, and many lived at or near subsistence level. Recurring famines and frequent warfare exacerbated their hardships, creating a challenging environment for rural communities.  This highlights the precarious position of the peasantry within the Sultanate's social structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Alauddin Khalji's agrarian reforms aimed to improve the state's revenue collection and control market prices, they were not designed to universally improve the living conditions of all peasants.  His policies, though aimed at increasing agricultural production and regulating prices, were also harsh and led to resentment among some sections of the rural population. The reforms were not universally beneficial to the peasantry, and the statement presents a misleadingly positive view of their impact.

This demonstrates a strategic understanding of limitations and a pragmatic approach to border disputes, a common theme in medieval Indian power dynamics.  The statement avoids oversimplification by acknowledging the military engagements that preceded the treaty.

Statement 2 correctly notes Nuniz's account of tribute paid to Deva Raya II. However, it cleverly incorporates the historical uncertainty surrounding the extent of Vijayanagara's influence.  The passage itself questions the reality of regular tribute from distant kingdoms like Pegu and Tenasserim, suggesting the possibility of diplomatic gifts or embassies instead. This nuanced approach avoids presenting the information as undisputed fact, thereby reflecting a critical understanding of historical sources and the complexities of interpreting historical accounts.  The inclusion of this element of doubt makes the statement historically accurate and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the limitations of primary sources.

**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara administrative structure, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara kingdom was divided into Rajyas or Mandalams (provinces), further subdivided into Nadus (districts), Sthalas (sub-districts), and Gramas (villages), mirroring the Chola administrative model closely.
2.  Provincial governors initially held significant autonomy, including the power to levy new taxes or remit old ones, but their authority was consistently challenged by the growing power of hereditary Nayaks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara kingdom did have a hierarchical administrative structure consisting of Rajyas/Mandalams, Nadus, Sthalas, and Gramas, it significantly differed from the Chola model.  The Chola system emphasized village self-governance, which was considerably weakened under Vijayanagara rule due to the rise of hereditary Nayakships. The statement incorrectly implies a close resemblance between the two systems.

Statement 2 is correct. Provincial governors in the Vijayanagara empire initially enjoyed considerable autonomy. They maintained their own courts, armies, and even issued their own coins (though of small denominations).  Crucially, they had the power to levy new taxes or remit existing ones, highlighting their significant administrative control. However, this autonomy was constantly challenged by the increasing power of hereditary Nayaks, who often acted semi-independently and posed a threat to central authority.  The rise of these powerful Nayaks ultimately contributed to the weakening of the Vijayanagara empire.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the economic policies of Krishna Deva Raya:**

1.  Krishna Deva Raya implemented a land tax system where rates were fixed based solely on the type of crop cultivated, irrespective of land quality or irrigation methods.
2.  The Vijayanagara economy under Krishna Deva Raya witnessed significant urbanization, fueled by flourishing temple-centered trade and the growth of towns around major religious sites.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Krishna Deva Raya's taxation system did involve varying tax rates depending on the type of crop, it was not solely based on this factor.  The text explicitly states that tax rates varied according to the type of crops, soil quality, and irrigation methods. This demonstrates a more nuanced approach to taxation than the statement suggests. The statement oversimplifies a complex tax structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The reign of Krishna Deva Raya saw a considerable expansion of urban centers and a flourishing trade network.  The text explicitly highlights the growth of towns, often located around major temples. These temples served as economic hubs, requiring supplies and distributing prasadam, stimulating local trade and contributing to urbanization. The expansion of trade, both internal and overseas, further boosted economic activity and urban development during this period.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The peasantry under Vijayanagara rule experienced consistent economic hardship, as evidenced by the accounts of foreign travelers who described widespread poverty among the rural population.
2.  Besides land revenue, the Vijayanagara state levied various other taxes, including property tax, sales tax, professional taxes, and taxes on specific events like marriages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While foreign travelers did note some poverty among the rural population, it's inaccurate to characterize the peasantry's economic condition as consistently harsh. The text itself acknowledges a lack of detailed information about village life and admits that the economic life of the peasantry remained "more or less the same."  The statement overgeneralizes the experiences of the peasantry based on limited and potentially biased accounts.  It fails to consider the existence of prosperous owner-cultivators.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vijayanagara state's revenue system was not limited to land tax. The text clearly mentions the existence of a variety of other taxes levied on different aspects of economic activity. Property tax, sales tax, professional taxes, military contributions (during emergencies), and even taxes on marriages all contributed to the state's revenue, showcasing a diverse and multi-faceted tax structure.


**4. With reference to the Nayakas in the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nayakas, initially appointed as military chiefs, gradually accumulated significant power and autonomy, eventually leading to the decentralization of the empire.
2.  The Nayakas were solely responsible for maintaining a fixed number of soldiers, horses, and elephants for the Vijayanagara army, with no financial obligations to the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nayakas (or Palegars) were initially appointed by the Vijayanagara rulers as military chiefs, granted land (gmaram) in exchange for military service.  However, over time, they accumulated considerable power and autonomy, effectively becoming semi-independent rulers within the empire. This gradual accretion of power significantly contributed to the weakening and eventual disintegration of the Vijayanagara empire. The statement accurately reflects the Nayakas' growing influence and its impact on the empire's structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Nayakas were indeed responsible for maintaining a specified number of soldiers, horses, and elephants for the Vijayanagara army, they also had significant financial obligations to the central government.  The text clearly states that they had to pay a sum of money to the central exchequer. This financial contribution was a crucial aspect of their relationship with the Vijayanagara state, and the statement's omission of this detail makes it factually incorrect.


**5. With reference to the reign of Krishna Deva Raya, consider the following statements:**

1. Krishna Deva Raya's reign marked a period of transition from the old to the new economy, characterized by a significant decline in agricultural production and the rise of mercantile capitalism.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya was a patron of Telugu and Sanskrit literature and commissioned several literary works, including a treatise on polity and a Sanskrit drama.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the text mentions Krishna Deva Raya's reign as a period of transition, it does *not* describe a decline in agricultural production. In fact, the text emphasizes the prosperity and population density of the empire under his rule.  The statement erroneously links the transition to a decline in agriculture and the rise of mercantile capitalism, which is not supported by the provided text. The statement misinterprets the nature of the economic transition.

Statement 2 is correct.  Krishna Deva Raya is widely known for his patronage of arts and literature. The text explicitly mentions his authorship of a Telugu work on polity and a Sanskrit drama, illustrating his contribution to both Telugu and Sanskrit literary traditions.  His reign is indeed considered a golden age in Telugu literature.  The statement accurately reflects his literary patronage and achievements.


**6. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom's administrative structure, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Mahmud Gawan, the Bahmani kingdom was divided into eight provinces (tarafs), each governed by a tarafdar, with salaries and obligations clearly defined.
2.  Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms included efforts to accurately measure land and fix the amount of land revenue payable by cultivators, leading to a more equitable system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms included the division of the Bahmani kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each headed by a tarafdar.  The text explicitly mentions the establishment of a system where the salaries and obligations of each noble were clearly defined. This demonstrates a clear attempt at streamlining and organizing the administrative structure of the kingdom.

Statement 2 is correct. Mahmud Gawan's reforms also focused on improving the land revenue system.  The text states that efforts were made to accurately measure land and fix the amount payable by cultivators.  This aimed to create a more systematic and equitable system of land revenue collection, enhancing the efficiency and fairness of the state's fiscal policies.  The statement accurately reflects a key component of Gawan's administrative reforms.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the economic conditions of the Delhi Sultanate:**

1. Ibn Battuta, in his account of the Delhi Sultanate, described a thriving urban economy characterized by large cities like Delhi and Daulatabad, and a significant volume of internal and external trade.
2. The Delhi Sultanate's economic prosperity was primarily based on a flourishing agricultural sector, with the majority of the population engaged in subsistence farming, and minimal development of manufacturing industries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ibn Battuta's accounts indeed depict a flourishing urban economy within the Delhi Sultanate. His descriptions of large cities like Delhi and Daulatabad, coupled with accounts of significant internal and external trade, highlight the economic dynamism of the period. The statement accurately reflects Ibn Battuta's observations on urban development and trade within the Sultanate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While agriculture was undoubtedly important to the Delhi Sultanate economy, it's inaccurate to characterize it as the *sole* driver of prosperity, or to portray manufacturing as minimally developed.  The text mentions various manufacturing industries, such as textile production (Bengal and Gujarat being particularly noted), leatherwork, metalwork, carpet weaving, and woodworking. These industries contributed significantly to the Sultanate's economy and trade, contradicting the statement's assertion of minimal industrial development. The statement presents an overly simplistic view of the Sultanate's diverse economy.


**8. With reference to the Mughal land revenue system under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Zabti system, implemented under Akbar, involved a fixed division of the agricultural produce between the peasant and the state, regardless of variations in crop yields or local market prices.
2.  Akbar's land revenue reforms included the introduction of the Dahsala system, which calculated the state's share based on the average produce and prices over the past ten years, thereby providing some degree of stability and predictability for the peasants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Zabti system, while aiming for a systematic assessment, did *not* involve a fixed division of produce regardless of variations. The Dahsala system, a refinement of Zabti, specifically addressed the issue of fluctuating crop yields and market prices by using averages over a ten-year period.  The statement incorrectly presents a rigid and inflexible aspect to the Zabti system, ignoring the later refinements and contextual factors.

Statement 2 is correct. The Dahsala system, a significant element of Akbar's land revenue reforms, utilized average produce and prices from the past ten years to determine the state's share.  This approach aimed to create a more stable and predictable system for both the state and the peasants, reducing the impact of annual fluctuations in agricultural output and market conditions. The statement accurately describes a key feature of the Dahsala system and its significance.


**9. With reference to the Mansabdari system in the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mansabdari system, introduced by Akbar, solely focused on organizing the Mughal army, with no implications for the broader administrative structure or social hierarchy.
2.  Under the Mansabdari system, a Mansabdar's rank (Mansab) was divided into two components: Zar (personal rank) and Sawar (number of cavalrymen to be maintained), with further categorization based on the number of cavalrymen actually maintained.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mansabdari system, while primarily designed to organize the Mughal army, had significant implications for the broader administrative structure and social hierarchy.  It essentially integrated the nobility into the military structure, shaping the administrative and political landscape of the empire. The statement wrongly limits the system's impact to the army alone.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Mansab, or rank, under the Mansabdari system was indeed divided into two components: Zar (personal rank, determining salary) and Sawar (the number of cavalrymen a Mansabdar was required to maintain). Furthermore, the Sawar component had further sub-categories (three, to be precise) based on whether the Mansabdar maintained the full number, half, or less than half of the assigned cavalry. This two-part system with sub-categories is a defining feature of the Mansabdari system, accurately represented in the statement.


**10. With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's abolition of the Jizya tax and the pilgrim tax demonstrated his commitment to religious tolerance and equality among his subjects, regardless of their faith.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, established by Akbar, was solely intended as a private chamber for his personal prayers and religious contemplation, with no involvement of scholars or representatives of different faiths.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's abolition of the Jizya tax (a tax on non-Muslims) and the pilgrim tax were significant steps towards promoting religious tolerance and equality within his empire. These actions demonstrated a departure from traditional discriminatory practices and aimed to foster a more inclusive and harmonious society. The statement accurately reflects the significance of these actions in Akbar's religious policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ibadat Khana, while initially intended as a place of private prayer, evolved into a forum for religious discussions involving scholars and representatives from various faiths.  Akbar's aim was to engage in intellectual discourse and explore different religious perspectives, making the statement's description of the Ibadat Khana as solely a private chamber for prayer factually inaccurate. The statement misrepresents the purpose and function of the Ibadat Khana.


**1. With reference to Akbar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's conquest of Sindh in 1590 facilitated trade along the Indus River, benefiting Punjab.
2.  Raja Birbal, a favorite of Akbar, died during an expedition to clear the Khyber Pass, which was blocked by rebellious tribesmen.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect events during Akbar's reign.  Statement 1 correctly notes the strategic importance of Akbar's conquest of Sindh in 1590.  Gaining control of Sindh opened up vital trade routes along the Indus River, directly impacting and boosting the economy of Punjab. This demonstrates Akbar's understanding of the interconnectedness of regional economies and his ability to leverage military victories for economic gain – a key aspect of his administrative acumen.  Statement 2 is also accurate.  The Khyber Pass, a crucial strategic gateway, was repeatedly a source of conflict due to rebellious tribesmen.  Akbar's attempts to secure this passage resulted in the unfortunate death of Raja Birbal, highlighting the risks involved in maintaining control over the empire's vast and often volatile borders. Birbal's death underscores the challenges Akbar faced in consolidating his Northwest frontier, despite his ultimate success.  The loss of a key advisor like Birbal also shows the human cost of imperial expansion.


**2. With reference to Akbar's integration policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar abolished the jizya tax, a poll tax on non-Muslims, and the pilgrim tax on bathing at holy places like Prayag and Banaras to promote religious equality.
2.  Akbar's policy of *sulh-kul*, or 'peace to all', involved bringing able Hindus into the nobility, including Rajput rajas, and granting mansabs based on competence, regardless of religious affiliation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key aspects of Akbar's integration policies. Statement 1 highlights Akbar's early actions to abolish discriminatory taxes like the jizya tax (levied on non-Muslims) and the pilgrim tax.  These actions were not merely symbolic; they aimed at fostering a sense of inclusivity and equality among his diverse subjects. Abolishing these taxes demonstrated a practical commitment to religious tolerance, a departure from traditional practices in many Muslim states. Statement 2 accurately reflects Akbar's broader strategy of *sulh-kul*. This policy wasn't solely about religious tolerance; it encompassed a pragmatic approach to governance. By incorporating capable Hindus, especially Rajput elites, into his administration and military through the mansabdari system, Akbar strengthened his empire's political and military base. This integration went beyond mere tokenism; it involved strategic alliances, inter-marriages, and a genuine effort to build trust and cooperation across religious lines.


**3. With reference to the Mughal expansion under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mirza Aziz Koka, Akbar's foster-brother, conquered Kathiawar in western India, expanding Mughal control.
2.  Raja Man Singh, the Mughal governor of Bengal, conquered Orissa, Cooch Bihar, and parts of East Bengal, including Dacca.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately represent significant expansions of the Mughal empire under Akbar. Statement 1 correctly identifies Mirza Aziz Koka's role in conquering Kathiawar. This conquest extended Mughal influence westward, solidifying their control over a strategically and economically important region.  Kathiawar's conquest showcases Akbar's ability to deploy trusted lieutenants effectively to achieve his expansionist goals. Statement 2 correctly attributes the conquest of Orissa, Cooch Bihar, and parts of East Bengal (including Dacca) to Raja Man Singh. This eastward expansion significantly increased Mughal territory and influence, extending their reach into regions previously dominated by Afghan chiefs and local rulers. Man Singh's success highlights both Akbar's military prowess and his ability to utilize capable commanders from diverse backgrounds. The conquests mentioned in both statements demonstrate Akbar's strategy of systematic expansion, securing vital territories and consolidating Mughal power across a vast geographical expanse.


**4. With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ibadat Khana, or Hall of Prayer, initially restricted to Muslim theologians, was later opened to people of all religions, leading to broader discussions on religious and spiritual matters.
2.  Akbar's issuance of a *makazr*, often wrongly called a "Decree of Infallibility," asserted his right to choose among conflicting interpretations of the Quran when differences arose among qualified scholars.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe crucial aspects of Akbar's religious policies. Statement 1 correctly describes the evolution of the Ibadat Khana. Initially intended as a space for discussions among Muslim theologians, its expansion to include representatives of various faiths reflects Akbar's growing interest in religious pluralism and his search for universal truths.  The transformation of the Ibadat Khana demonstrates a shift from orthodox Islamic discourse to a more inclusive and syncretic approach.  The initial disorderly nature of the discussions among Muslim scholars and Akbar's subsequent disillusionment with their rigid interpretations further highlight his intellectual curiosity and openness to alternative perspectives. Statement 2 accurately describes Akbar's issuance of the *makazr*. This declaration, while not a decree of infallibility,  asserted Akbar's authority to interpret religious doctrines in matters of conflict among scholars. This move, though controversial, aimed to quell sectarian disputes and maintain social harmony within his empire.  It reflects Akbar's attempt to use his political power to influence religious discourse and promote a more unified and peaceful society.


**5. With reference to the reign of Mahmud Begarha of Gujarat, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Begarha's conquest of Girnar Fort in Saurashtra was facilitated by treason within the fort's leadership.
2.  Mahmud Begarha's conquest of Champaner Fort led to the performance of Jauhar by the Rajput defenders and their families.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect events during the reign of Mahmud Begarha. Statement 1 correctly details the circumstances surrounding the conquest of Girnar Fort.  While Mahmud Begarha employed a large army, his success was significantly aided by internal treachery. The betrayal by a disgruntled minister, who had a personal grievance against the fort's ruler, weakened the defenses and facilitated the Mughal conquest. This highlights the importance of intelligence gathering and exploiting internal divisions in warfare, a strategy employed by many rulers. Statement 2 accurately describes the events surrounding the fall of Champaner Fort. Faced with imminent defeat and capture, the Rajput defenders, including women and children, performed Jauhar – a ritualistic mass self-immolation to avoid capture and dishonor.  This tragic event underscores the fierce resistance faced by Mahmud Begarha and the extreme measures taken by the Rajputs to defend their independence and honor.  The Jauhar at Champaner is a significant historical event, showcasing Rajput valor and the desperate measures taken in the face of overwhelming odds.


**6. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur, known as "Friend of the Poor," composed the *Kitizb-i-Nawras*, a book of songs set to various ragas, showcasing his interest in music and his patronage of arts.
2.  Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda, a poet and patron of arts, built the Charminar in Hyderabad, a significant architectural achievement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements highlight the significant cultural contributions of the Deccan states. Statement 1 accurately describes Ibrahim Adil Shah II's patronage of arts, particularly music. His composition of *Kitizb-i-Nawras*, a collection of songs set to various ragas, demonstrates his personal interest in music and his support for musical traditions. The fact that he invoked the goddess Saraswati in his songs further emphasizes the syncretic nature of Deccan culture.  His title, "Friend of the Poor," reflects his concern for social welfare. Statement 2 correctly identifies Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah's role in constructing the Charminar. This iconic structure, situated in Hyderabad, is a testament to the architectural achievements of the Golconda sultanate.  The Charminar's design, with its four minarets and intricate carvings, reflects the rich blend of architectural styles prevalent in the Deccan.  Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah's own literary pursuits further solidify his reputation as a patron of arts and letters.  Together, both statements illustrate the flourishing cultural scene in the Deccan, characterized by a blend of artistic expressions and patronage from the ruling elites.


**7. With reference to the political situation in North India during the 16th century, consider the following statements:**

1. The battle of Khanwa (1527) secured Babur's position in the Delhi-Agra region after defeating Rana Sanga's Rajput confederacy.
2.  Following Babur's death, Humayun faced challenges from his brothers, notably Kamran, who contested his claim to the throne.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect significant political events in 16th-century North India. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Battle of Khanwa as a pivotal moment in Babur's consolidation of power.  His victory over Rana Sanga's formidable Rajput forces secured his control over the strategically important Delhi-Agra region. The battle showcased Babur's military skills, particularly his effective use of gunpowder and artillery, which proved decisive against the Rajput cavalry.  This victory laid the foundation for the Mughal Empire's expansion in India. Statement 2 accurately describes the challenges Humayun faced upon succeeding Babur.  The traditional Timurid practice of dividing the empire among brothers led to conflicts, with Humayun's brother Kamran being a particularly significant threat.  Kamran's rebellion highlights the internal instability that plagued the early Mughal Empire and the difficulties Humayun faced in consolidating his authority and establishing a stable succession.  The conflicts between Humayun and his brothers underscore the precarious nature of power transitions in early Mughal history.


**8. With reference to the Mughal Empire's decline, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's death in 1707 marked a turning point, leading to increased factional fighting among nobles and the rise of ambitious provincial governors who acted independently.
2. The Maratha expansion under Shivaji and his successors posed a significant challenge to the Mughal Empire's authority, extending their influence from the Deccan into the Gangetic plains.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly identify key factors contributing to the decline of the Mughal Empire. Statement 1 accurately describes the immediate consequences of Aurangzeb's death. The removal of his strong hand led to internal power struggles among the nobles, further weakening the central authority.  Ambitious provincial governors, sensing the weakening of the imperial hold, began to assert their independence, leading to fragmentation of the empire. This internal strife played a significant role in the Mughal Empire's decline. Statement 2 correctly emphasizes the significant challenge posed by the Maratha expansion.  Under Shivaji and his successors, the Marathas successfully challenged Mughal dominance, expanding their influence and power from their base in the Deccan into the heartland of the Mughal Empire, the Gangetic plains.  The Maratha incursions not only weakened Mughal control but also exposed the empire's vulnerabilities and the limitations of its administrative and military capabilities.  The combined impact of internal strife and external pressure from the Marathas accelerated the Mughal Empire's decline.


**9. With reference to the administrative reforms of Sher Shah Suri, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system involved measuring cultivated land and fixing crop rates based on land productivity, creating a central price schedule for agricultural produce.
2. Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms included the establishment of a new city near Delhi, with the Old Fort (Purana Qila) being one of the surviving structures from that period.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe aspects of Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms. Statement 1 accurately details his land revenue system.  Sher Shah Suri's system was a significant improvement over previous methods, introducing a more efficient and systematic approach to land revenue collection.  The process of measuring cultivated land and fixing crop rates based on productivity aimed at ensuring fairness and preventing exploitation of peasants. The attempt to create a central price schedule, though not fully successful, reflected an effort toward standardization and transparency.  This system, while not perfect, was a substantial step towards a more equitable and efficient revenue system. Statement 2 is also correct.  Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms included the construction of a new city near Delhi.  The Old Fort (Purana Qila) stands as one of the surviving structures from this urban planning project.  The construction of a new city reflected Sher Shah Suri's ambition to create a strong and well-organized capital, symbolizing his administrative capabilities and his desire to leave a lasting legacy.  The Old Fort's architecture reflects the architectural styles of his period.


**10. With reference to the early Mughal conquests, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's conquest of Malwa involved the defeat of Baz Bahadur, whose kingdom had become a celebrated center for music under his rule.
2.  Akbar's conquest of Garh-Katanga resulted in the death of Rani Durgavati, who valiantly defended her kingdom against Mughal forces.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect events during Akbar's early conquests. Statement 1 correctly describes the conquest of Malwa. The defeat of Baz Bahadur, while militarily significant, also highlights the cultural impact of Mughal expansion.  Baz Bahadur's kingdom was known for its flourishing musical traditions, and his defeat marked the end of an era of artistic and cultural prominence in Malwa.  The story of Rupmati, Baz Bahadur's consort, further adds to the narrative surrounding this conquest. Statement 2 accurately details the conquest of Garh-Katanga and the tragic fate of Rani Durgavati. Her valiant defense against the superior Mughal forces, culminating in her self-sacrifice, has become a legendary tale of Rajput valor and resistance.  Rani Durgavati's story is a powerful reminder of the human cost of imperial expansion and the resilience of local rulers in the face of overwhelming odds.  The immense plunder acquired by the Mughals from Garh-Katanga also underscores the economic incentives driving Mughal expansion.


**1. With reference to Akbar's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar divided the empire into twelve Subas in 1580, each headed by a Subedar assisted by a Diwan, Bakhshi, Sadr, Qazi, and Waqi'a-Navis.
2.  The Mansabdari system, introduced under Akbar, initially paid Mansabdars at an average rate of Rs. 240 per annum per Sawar, later reduced to Rs. 200 under Jahangir.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Akbar's administrative reforms involved the division of the empire into twelve Subas (provinces) in 1580. Each Suba was governed by a Subedar, who was assisted by a team of officials with specialized responsibilities: the Diwan (finance), Bakhshi (military), Sadr (religious affairs), Qazi (judicial), and Waqi'a-Navis (chronicler). This decentralized structure aimed at efficient governance and control across the vast empire.  This system of checks and balances was a key component of Akbar's administrative success.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Mansabdari system, a crucial element of Akbar's military and administrative structure, initially provided Mansabdars (officers) with salaries based on the number of Sawars (cavalrymen) they were responsible for maintaining. While the exact initial rate is debated among historians,  the text indicates an average of Rs. 240 per annum per Sawar.  This was later revised to Rs. 200 under Jahangir, reflecting adjustments in fiscal policy and perhaps, the need to control expenditure. The system’s complexities, including variations in zat and sawar ranks and payment methods, are important aspects of Mughal administration.


**2. With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar abolished the Jizya tax in 1564, primarily to foster religious harmony and remove a source of discrimination against non-Muslims.
2. The Ibadat Khana, established in 1575, initially focused solely on discussions among Muslim theologians but later expanded to include representatives of various faiths.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's abolition of the Jizya tax, a poll tax levied on non-Muslims, in 1564 was a significant step towards religious tolerance.  While revenue considerations might have played a minor role, the primary motive was to promote religious harmony and eliminate a discriminatory practice that symbolized the unequal treatment of different religious communities within the empire. This demonstrates Akbar’s pragmatic approach to governance and his willingness to compromise for the greater good of the empire's stability.

Statement 2 is also accurate. The Ibadat Khana, or "House of Worship," established by Akbar in 1575, initially served as a platform for discussions among Muslim theologians.  However, Akbar's evolving religious views led him to expand the Ibadat Khana's scope to include representatives from various religions including Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, and Jainism. These discussions aimed to foster understanding and explore common religious principles, although they also generated controversy and accusations of religious syncretism.


**3. With reference to the Mughal expansion under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's conquest of Sindh in 1590 facilitated trade along the Indus River, benefiting Punjab.
2. Raja Birbal, a favored noble of Akbar, died during an expedition to clear the Khyber Pass, which had been blocked by rebellious tribesmen.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is historically accurate. Akbar's successful campaign in Sindh in 1590 brought the region under Mughal control.  This strategic conquest opened up the Indus River for trade, significantly benefiting Punjab by providing a vital trade route and enhancing economic prosperity.  The integration of Sindh into the Mughal empire had wide-ranging economic and political implications, strengthening the empire's trade networks and consolidating its control over a crucial region.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Khyber Pass, a strategically significant mountain pass, was blocked by rebellious tribesmen during Akbar’s reign.  Akbar dispatched expeditions to clear the pass, and during one of these campaigns, Raja Birbal, a trusted and highly regarded noble, unfortunately lost his life.  Birbal’s death highlights the risks and challenges associated with maintaining control over the empire's vast and diverse territories. His death also serves as a significant historical event that illustrates the dangers faced by the Mughal administration in its border regions.


**4. With reference to Aurangzeb's Deccan campaigns, consider the following statements:**

1. Jai Singh I's Bijapur campaign in 1665 failed primarily due to a lack of siege weaponry and the united front presented by the Deccani states against the Mughals.
2. The fall of Bijapur in 1686 and Golconda in 1687 marked the culmination of Aurangzeb’s Deccan campaigns, but not the end of his challenges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jai Singh I's campaign against Bijapur in 1665, while ambitious, ultimately failed due to a combination of factors.  Crucially, the lack of adequate siege weaponry hampered the Mughal ability to effectively assault the fortified city of Bijapur.  Furthermore, the campaign inadvertently united the Deccani states (Bijapur, Golconda) against the Mughals, who employed effective guerrilla tactics, denying the Mughals essential supplies. This unified resistance significantly weakened the Mughal campaign and contributed to its failure.

Statement 2 is also correct. Aurangzeb’s conquest of Bijapur in 1686 and Golconda in 1687 represented a significant military achievement, marking the effective end of the independent Deccani sultanates. However, these victories did not bring an end to Aurangzeb's difficulties in the Deccan.  The Maratha resistance continued relentlessly, posing a persistent and formidable challenge to Mughal authority.  The prolonged struggle with the Marathas during and after the conquest of these sultanates is a crucial aspect of Aurangzeb's reign.


**5. With reference to the early Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's victory at the Battle of Panipat in 1526 marked the beginning of Mughal rule in India, but consolidating this rule required further military campaigns.
2. The Battle of Khanwa in 1527, where Babur defeated Rana Sanga, secured Babur's position in the Delhi-Agra region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Babur's decisive victory at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 against Ibrahim Lodi effectively ended the Lodi dynasty's rule and established the foundation for Mughal rule in India. However, this victory was just the first step.  Babur faced significant challenges in consolidating his control, primarily from Rajput resistance led by Rana Sanga and continued Afghan opposition.  These subsequent conflicts highlight the difficulties in establishing a stable and secure Mughal empire.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Battle of Khanwa in 1527, where Babur decisively defeated Rana Sanga, a powerful Rajput ruler, was a crucial turning point in establishing Mughal dominance.  This victory significantly weakened the Rajput confederacy and secured Babur's position in the strategically important Delhi-Agra region.  The Battle of Khanwa is considered a landmark event in the establishment and consolidation of early Mughal power.


**1. With reference to Akbar's administrative system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *Subedar* in each of Akbar's twelve *subas* held absolute authority, unchecked by other officials.
2.  The *Diwan*, *Bakshi*, *Sadr*, and *Qazi* in each province served as checks and balances on the *Subedar*'s power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the *Subedar* was the chief governor of a *suba* (province), Akbar's administrative system deliberately avoided concentrating absolute power in a single individual's hands.  The appointment of other officials like the *Diwan* (finance), *Bakshi* (military), *Sadr* (religious affairs), and *Qazi* (judicial) within each province ensured a system of checks and balances.  These officials had specific responsibilities and could report directly to the emperor, limiting the *Subedar*'s potential for unchecked authority.  This reflects Akbar's sophisticated understanding of administrative efficiency and the prevention of corruption.

Statement 2 is correct. The presence of the *Diwan*, *Bakshi*, *Sadr*, and *Qazi* in each province served as a crucial mechanism to prevent arbitrary rule by the *Subedar*.  Each official's distinct role ensured accountability and prevented the concentration of power. The system was designed to promote efficient governance, minimize corruption, and maintain a balance of power within the provincial administration.  This system was a key element in the success of Akbar's vast empire.  The careful division of responsibilities and the incorporation of checks and balances demonstrate Akbar's administrative acumen and his efforts to create a stable and efficient governing structure.


**2. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar primarily relied on matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers to consolidate his power, foregoing other methods of integration.
2.  Akbar's policy towards the Rajputs involved a combination of matrimonial alliances, religious tolerance, and the granting of high offices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While matrimonial alliances were a significant part of Akbar's Rajput policy, it was not his sole method of integrating the Rajputs into his empire.  Akbar employed a multi-pronged approach that included strategic marriages to cement alliances with powerful Rajput houses, but also encompassed significant elements of religious tolerance (such as abolishing the *jizya* tax), granting high positions within the Mughal nobility to Rajput leaders, and incorporating Rajput military contingents into the Mughal army.  This holistic strategy was crucial to his success in bringing the Rajputs into the Mughal fold.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar’s Rajput policy was a masterful blend of political pragmatism and shrewd diplomacy.  He understood the importance of integrating the powerful Rajput clans into his empire and did so through a multifaceted approach.  This included strategic marriages with Rajput princesses, which symbolized trust and alliance, while simultaneously granting them high positions and mansabs in the Mughal administration and military.  His policy of religious tolerance, particularly the abolition of the *jizya* tax, further enhanced his appeal to the Rajput population.  This combination of strategies effectively neutralized potential opposition and solidified Mughal control over key regions.


**3. With reference to the Mansabdari System, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's Mansabdari system was exclusively a military system, with no administrative implications.
2. The Mansabdari system, introduced by Akbar, was entirely original and unprecedented in its design.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mansabdari system, though primarily a military system determining rank and responsibilities of officers, had significant administrative implications. Mansabdars held both military and administrative posts, combining military command with revenue collection, judicial functions, and other administrative duties within their assigned territories.  The system was integral to the Mughal administrative structure, linking military strength with effective governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Akbar refined and expanded the Mansabdari system, making it a defining characteristic of his administration, the system wasn't entirely original. It drew inspiration from pre-existing systems of military organization in Persia and Central Asia.  Akbar adapted and improved upon these existing models, creating a more efficient and centralized system that suited the needs of his vast and diverse empire.  The system's success lay in its adaptability and its effectiveness in integrating diverse military and administrative functions under a single framework.


**4. With reference to the Mughal Empire's relations with Central Asian powers, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's primary concern regarding Central Asian powers was the economic threat posed by their control of trade routes.
2.  Akbar's acquisition of Qandahar was primarily a strategic move to secure the northwestern frontier against Uzbek incursions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While control of trade routes was undoubtedly a factor in Mughal relations with Central Asian powers, Akbar's primary concern was the military threat posed by these powers, particularly the Uzbeks. The potential for invasion and disruption of the northwestern frontier was a far more pressing issue than purely economic considerations.  Akbar's policies towards Central Asia reflect a strategic focus on maintaining security and stability in his empire's vulnerable border regions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The acquisition of Qandahar in 1595 was a crucial strategic move by Akbar to secure his northwestern frontier.  Qandahar's strategic location at the crossroads of trade routes and its strong fortifications made it a vital asset in deterring potential Uzbek invasions.  The region's control was essential for the security of Kabul and the stability of the Mughal empire's western flank.  Akbar's actions demonstrate his understanding of geopolitical strategy and his determination to safeguard his empire's borders.


**5. With reference to Sher Shah Suri's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms were largely based on the existing Mughal administrative structure.
2. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is considered a significant architectural achievement, representing a blend of styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms were not based on the Mughal system, which was still in its formative stages during his reign.  Instead, his reforms drew upon existing administrative practices in India and were characterized by innovative approaches to land revenue, military organization, and road infrastructure. His system was independent and highly effective, leaving a lasting impact on subsequent rulers.

Statement 2 is correct. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is a remarkable example of architecture, showcasing a sophisticated blend of architectural styles.  It is considered a masterpiece of its time and stands as a testament to his patronage of the arts and his legacy as a significant ruler.  The tomb's design and construction demonstrate a high level of architectural skill and artistic vision.  Its enduring presence is a symbol of his reign and lasting impact on Indian history.


**6.  With reference to the early Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's victory at Panipat in 1526 immediately led to the complete consolidation of Mughal rule across the Indian subcontinent.
2. The Battle of Khanwa in 1527 was a crucial victory for Babur, solidifying his control over northern India and weakening Rajput opposition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Babur's victory at Panipat marked a significant turning point, but it did not lead to immediate consolidation of Mughal rule across the entire subcontinent.  Subsequent battles, such as Khanwa, were necessary to secure Mughal control over key regions and suppress opposition from powerful Rajput and Afghan forces. The process of establishing a stable Mughal empire was gradual and involved significant military campaigns and political maneuvering.

Statement 2 is correct. The Battle of Khanwa was a decisive victory for Babur, significantly weakening the Rajput confederation led by Rana Sanga and solidifying Mughal control over a substantial portion of northern India.  This victory was instrumental in establishing the Mughal foothold in the region and paved the way for future expansion. The battle demonstrated Babur's military prowess and strategic acumen and its outcome had far-reaching consequences for the political landscape of northern India.


**7. With reference to Aurangzeb's Deccan policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's conquest of Bijapur and Golconda immediately led to the end of Maratha resistance.
2. Aurangzeb's execution of Sambhaji, the Maratha king, was a strategically sound decision that weakened Maratha power significantly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aurangzeb's conquest of Bijapur and Golconda did not bring an end to Maratha resistance. In fact, it arguably intensified Maratha resistance, leading to a protracted and costly conflict for the Mughals. The elimination of the two major Deccan sultanates removed a buffer against Mughal expansion and united the Marathas against a common enemy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the execution of Sambhaji was a brutal act, it was not a strategically sound decision from a long-term perspective.  It galvanized Maratha resistance, transforming it into a more decentralized yet potent force under different leaders.  The elimination of a central figure allowed the Marathas to adapt their strategy and continue their struggle against the Mughal empire. This decision proved to be a significant miscalculation by Aurangzeb.


**8. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan sultanates, consider the following statements:**

1. The Deccan sultanates were primarily characterized by religious intolerance and suppression of non-Muslim cultures.
2. The Deccan sultanates made significant contributions to the fields of literature, music, and architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Deccan sultanates, while predominantly Muslim, were not characterized by religious intolerance and suppression of non-Muslim cultures. Several rulers actively patronized both Hindu and Muslim artists, scholars, and musicians, fostering a relatively tolerant environment.  There were instances of religious harmony and cultural exchange, contributing to a vibrant cultural landscape in the Deccan.

Statement 2 is correct. The Deccan sultanates made substantial contributions to literature (especially in Urdu and Marathi), music (with the development of distinct musical styles), and architecture (producing iconic structures like the Charminar and the Gol Gumbaz).  This cultural flourishing demonstrates a sophisticated and cosmopolitan outlook that transcended religious boundaries.  The patronage extended by rulers to diverse artistic and intellectual pursuits resulted in a rich cultural legacy.


**9. With reference to the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mughal nobility consisted primarily of foreign-born individuals, with limited participation from native-born Indians.
2. The Mughal nobility played a significant role in the economic development of India, engaging in both land ownership and commercial activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mughal nobility, while initially heavily influenced by Central Asian and Persian elements, increasingly incorporated native-born Indians, including Hindus and Muslims. Over time, a significant portion of the nobility came from within India itself, reflecting a gradual process of integration and assimilation.  The composition of the nobility evolved over the centuries, becoming more diverse and representative of the Indian population.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mughal nobility played a crucial role in the economic development of India.  They were major landowners, controlling vast tracts of agricultural land.  Simultaneously, many nobles actively participated in commercial activities, engaging in trade, moneylending, and other economic ventures.  Their involvement in both agriculture and commerce contributed significantly to the overall economic dynamism of the Mughal era.  Their economic influence is a crucial aspect of understanding the Mughal period's economic landscape.


**10. With reference to the early Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1. Humayun's reign was marked by significant territorial expansion and consolidation of Mughal power in India.
2. Akbar's accession to the throne was followed by a period of immediate peace and stability within the Mughal Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Humayun's reign was characterized by instability and a struggle for power, rather than significant territorial expansion and consolidation. He lost the throne to Sher Shah Suri and spent many years in exile before regaining it briefly before his death.  His reign was marked by challenges and setbacks rather than consistent success.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Akbar's accession to the throne was followed by a period of significant challenges, including conflicts with Afghan forces and internal power struggles within the Mughal nobility.  The establishment of a stable and secure Mughal empire under Akbar was a gradual process that involved overcoming considerable obstacles.  His early reign was defined by political maneuvering and military campaigns to consolidate his power and secure his position.

**1. With reference to Akbar's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's division of the empire into twelve Subas in 1580 included Bengal, Bihar, Allahabad, Awadh, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Multan, Kabul, Ajmer, Malwa, and Gujarat, each province headed by a Subedar, Diwan, Bakhshi, Sadr, Qazi, and Waqia-navis.
2.  The Ghusal Khana, initially Akbar's bathing apartment, evolved into a chamber for confidential consultations with ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Akbar's division of the empire into twelve Subas in 1580, listing the provinces and the key administrative officials appointed to each. This demonstrates a well-structured and decentralized administrative system aimed at effective governance across the vast empire.  The inclusion of diverse officials reflects a system of checks and balances intended to prevent corruption and ensure accountability.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The passage clearly explains how the Ghusal Khana, initially Akbar's bathing area, transformed into a private chamber for confidential meetings with his ministers. This evolution highlights the informal yet crucial aspects of Akbar's governance, emphasizing personal interaction and decision-making processes beyond formal Darbars.


**2. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers, exemplified by his marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bhara Mal of Amber, were primarily aimed at consolidating political power and were not accompanied by religious tolerance for his Hindu wives.
2.  Akbar’s policy extended beyond matrimonial alliances; the Hadas of Ranthambhor, despite lacking matrimonial ties, remained high in his favor, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to forging alliances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar did use matrimonial alliances strategically (as shown by his marriage to Harkha Bai), the text explicitly contradicts the assertion that religious tolerance was absent.  It emphasizes that Akbar granted complete religious freedom to his Hindu wives and bestowed honored positions upon their families within the nobility. This demonstrates a nuanced policy beyond mere political expediency.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly cites the example of the Hadas of Ranthambhor, highlighting that Akbar did not solely rely on matrimonial alliances to secure alliances. This showcases a pragmatic approach that valued loyalty and competence over strict adherence to a single strategy.  This demonstrates a flexible and adaptable policy.


**3. With reference to the Mughal administrative system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama-Dami, a register maintained by the revenue department, indicated the assessed income of various areas in rupees, facilitating the efficient assignment of Jagirs to Mansabdars.
2.  The Mansabdari system, while bureaucratic in nature, could not entirely eliminate the feudal attachment of nobles to land, representing a persistent tension within the Mughal administrative structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the Jama-Dami indicated assessed income in *dams*, not rupees, a crucial detail often overlooked. The conversion rate of 40 dams to a rupee is a significant element of the Mughal financial system and understanding this distinction is vital for accurate assessment.

Statement 2 is correct. The text highlights the inherent tension between the Mughal attempt to create a bureaucratic system and the persistent feudal attachment of the nobility to land.  This conflict is a key aspect of understanding the complexities and limitations of the Mughal administrative system. The persistence of feudal ties despite bureaucratic attempts to control them is a significant factor in analyzing the system's strengths and weaknesses.


**4. With reference to Aurangzeb's Deccan policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's conquest of Bijapur and Golconda, while initially appearing as a triumph, exacerbated the problem of jagir shortages, leading to increased disaffection among the Mughal nobility and fostering the rise of the Marathas.
2.  Jai Singh's advocacy for an all-out forward policy in the Deccan was initially rejected by Aurangzeb, who preferred a more cautious approach, delaying the inevitable conflict with the Marathas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The annexation of Bijapur and Golconda, while strategically significant, created a severe shortage of suitable Jagirs for the Mughal nobility. This led to widespread discontent, weakening the empire's internal cohesion and inadvertently strengthening the Maratha position. The text highlights the unintended consequences of Aurangzeb's military successes in the Deccan.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text explicitly mentions Jai Singh's advocacy for a proactive Deccan policy and Aurangzeb's initial reluctance to adopt this strategy.  Aurangzeb's hesitation, stemming from various factors including the situation in the northwest and his own political considerations, ultimately delayed effective action against the growing Maratha threat. This delayed response is a crucial aspect in understanding Aurangzeb's Deccan policy and its ultimate failure.


**5. With reference to Babur's early campaigns in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's initial forays into India were primarily motivated by the desire to acquire the Punjab parganas to supplement the meagre income of Kabul and to provide a strategic base against potential Uzbek attacks.
2.  The Battle of Panipat (1526) decisively ended the Lodi dynasty's rule and secured Babur's control over the entire area up to Jaunpur without any further significant battles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly explains Babur's motivations for his early Indian campaigns.  He sought to gain control of the Punjab's resources to bolster his weak financial position in Kabul and establish a secure base against potential threats from the Uzbeks. This highlights the economic and strategic factors driving Babur's expansion into India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Battle of Panipat was a significant victory for Babur, the text explicitly mentions that he had to fight further battles, notably against Rana Sanga at Khanwa, before consolidating his hold on the conquered territories up to Jaunpur.  This demonstrates that Babur's conquest was not immediate or effortless.  The mention of further battles challenges the assertion of immediate and complete control after Panipat.


**6. With reference to Alauddin Khalji's economic policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Alauddin Khalji's market control measures, including price fixing of various commodities, were primarily aimed at ensuring a regular supply of cheap foodgrains to the army and citizens, thereby bolstering his military strength and political stability.
2. Alauddin Khalji's agrarian reforms, which involved direct collection of land revenue based on land measurement, primarily targeted the wealthy landlords (Khuts and Muqaddams) to redistribute wealth and promote social equality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text emphasizes that Alauddin's market control measures were crucial for maintaining a large and efficient army by ensuring cheap food supplies. This was a key element of his strategy, linking economic control directly to military and political stability. The emphasis on cheap foodgrains for the army and citizens highlights the pragmatic and strategic nature of his policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Alauddin's agrarian reforms did affect wealthy landlords, the primary objective was not wealth redistribution or social equality.  The text suggests that the reforms were intended to ensure efficient and direct collection of land revenue, enhancing the state's financial resources to support the army and state functioning. Although the reforms had unintended social consequences, the primary goal was economic, not social.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring in-depth knowledge of Medieval Indian history.


**1. With reference to Shah Jahan's Deccan policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The treaty of 1636 with Bijapur stipulated that Bijapur would cede territory worth approximately 80 lakh rupees annually in exchange for Mughal recognition of Bijapuri suzerainty over Golconda.
2.  The Golconda treaty of 1636 required Golconda to pay an annual tribute of two lakh Auns to the Mughal emperor, remitting its previous tribute to Bijapur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1636 treaty with Bijapur involved Bijapur recognizing Mughal suzerainty, paying an indemnity, and not interfering in Golconda's affairs.  Bijapur received territory worth approximately 80 lakh rupees annually (from Ahmadnagar) *in return* for these concessions, not as a payment to the Mughals for recognition of Bijapuri suzerainty over Golconda. The treaty aimed to integrate Bijapur into the Mughal sphere of influence, not to establish Bijapur's dominance over Golconda.

Statement 2 is correct. The Golconda treaty of 1636 did indeed mandate Golconda to pay a reduced annual tribute of two lakh Auns to the Mughal emperor, ending its previous tributary relationship with Bijapur.  This demonstrates Shah Jahan's success in consolidating Mughal power in the Deccan by altering existing power dynamics.  The remission of tribute to Bijapur and the establishment of a tributary relationship with the Mughal emperor showcases a shift in regional power balance.

**2. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur, known as "Friend of the Poor," authored "Kitab-i-Nawras," a collection of songs set to various ragas, and significantly patronized Marathi literature.
2.  Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda, a poet who wrote in Dakhini Urdu, Persian, and Telugu, is credited with constructing the Charminar in Hyderabad.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate reflections of the cultural contributions of the Deccan states.  Statement 1 correctly identifies Ibrahim Adil Shah II's patronage of the arts and his authorship of "Kitab-i-Nawras," highlighting his inclusive approach by incorporating elements of Hindu culture (ragas) and his title reflecting social concern.  The mention of Marathi literature patronage further emphasizes the cultural blending in Bijapur.

Statement 2 is also correct in its assertion about Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah's poetic contributions and his architectural achievements. His multilingual poetry reflects the cosmopolitan nature of Golconda's court, and the Charminar stands as a testament to his patronage of architecture and urban planning, shaping the identity of Hyderabad.


**3. With reference to Akbar's administrative and economic policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Zabt system, implemented by Akbar, involved calculating the average produce and prices over the last five years to determine the state's share (one-third) of the land revenue, payable in cash.
2.  Akbar's Mansabdari system assigned ranks (Mansabs) to officers, with the highest rank initially being 5000, later increased to 7000, indicating both the officer's personal status and the number of cavalrymen he was to maintain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Zabt system did indeed involve calculating the average produce to determine the state's share (one-third), it was based on the average of the *last ten* years (dahsala), not five.  The system aimed for a more accurate and fair assessment of land revenue than previous methods. The emphasis on a ten-year average highlights the system's attempt at long-term stability and fairness.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's Mansabdari system is accurately described. The initial highest rank was 5000, later raised to 7000, signifying both personal status and military responsibilities.  This system played a crucial role in organizing the Mughal nobility and army, maintaining control and promoting loyalty.  The dual nature of the Mansab (personal rank and military command) is key to its effectiveness in controlling the nobility and military.


**4.  With reference to the Mughal-Deccan relations during Akbar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's conquest of Gujarat in 1572 immediately led to a Mughal invasion of the Deccan, aiming to establish Mughal suzerainty over the region's kingdoms.
2.  The Marathas, initially employed as bargirs (auxiliaries) in the Bahmani kingdom, gradually gained prominence in the Deccan states, holding significant positions in Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, and Golconda.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the conquest of Gujarat did bring the Mughals closer geographically to the Deccan, Akbar did not immediately invade.  He focused on other matters, notably consolidating his Northwest frontier, before turning his attention to the Deccan.  The delay highlights Akbar's strategic approach to expansion.

Statement 2 is correct. The rise of the Marathas in the Deccan is accurately described.  Their service as bargirs laid the foundation for their increasing influence and the acquisition of significant positions within the Deccan sultanates.  This demonstrates a pattern of local recruitment and integration into the political landscape of the Deccan, a trend seen in other regions under Mughal rule.


**5. With reference to the reign of Sher Shah Suri, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system abolished the practice of crop-sharing (batai) and exclusively implemented a cash-based system based on land measurement.
2. The "Grand Trunk Road," extending from the Indus to Sonargaon, was a significant infrastructural achievement during Sher Shah's reign, facilitated by the construction of numerous sarais (lodges) along its length.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system emphasized land measurement and aimed for a more efficient and equitable system, it did *not* abolish batai entirely.  Peasants retained the option of paying in cash or kind (batai), although the state preferred cash payments. This demonstrates a pragmatic approach, adapting to local conditions and practices.

Statement 2 is correct. The restoration and expansion of the "Grand Trunk Road" with its strategically placed sarais is accurately described. This infrastructural development significantly contributed to improved trade, communication, and the overall governance of Sher Shah's vast empire.  The sarais, with their provisions for travelers, further enhanced the road’s utility and security.  This highlights the importance of infrastructure in consolidating an empire.


**1. With reference to Sher Shah Suri's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is a significant example of the culmination of earlier architectural styles and a precursor to new styles.
2.  The Purana Qila in Delhi is a surviving structure from a new city built by Sher Shah Suri on the banks of the Yamuna.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is widely recognized as a masterpiece of architecture, representing a synthesis of pre-existing architectural styles and a pivotal point in the evolution of subsequent architectural trends.  Its unique design and construction techniques showcase a blend of influences, making it a significant landmark in the history of Indian architecture.  The tomb's construction during Sher Shah's lifetime further highlights its importance as a deliberate architectural statement.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Sher Shah Suri undertook the ambitious project of building a new city on the banks of the Yamuna River near Delhi. While much of the city has been lost to time, the Purana Qila (Old Fort) remains a testament to this endeavor.  The fine mosque within the Purana Qila further underscores the architectural and urban planning ambitions of Sher Shah Suri's reign.  This surviving structure offers valuable insights into the urban development and architectural styles prevalent during his time.  The fact that it is the only significant survivor emphasizes its historical significance.


**2. With reference to the early life of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's birth took place in Amarkot in 1542, while his father Humayun was retreating from Bikaner and received shelter from the Rana of Amarkot.
2.  Following Humayun's death, Akbar was crowned at Kalanaur in 1556 at the age of thirteen years and four months, while commanding operations against Afghan rebels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect events in Akbar's early life. Statement 1 correctly identifies Amarkot as Akbar's birthplace in 1542, emphasizing the context of Humayun's retreat from Bikaner and the hospitality offered by the Rana of Amarkot. This detail highlights the precarious political situation during Humayun's reign and the significance of the refuge provided to the Mughal heir.  The specific date and location add a layer of precision to the historical narrative.

Statement 2 is also accurate in stating that Akbar's coronation took place at Kalanaur in 1556, at the age of thirteen years and four months. The context of his simultaneously commanding operations against Afghan rebels underscores the immediate challenges he faced upon ascending the throne. This illustrates the young emperor's immediate involvement in military affairs and the turbulent political landscape he inherited. The precise age and location again add depth to the historical account.


**3. With reference to the Battle of Panipat (1556), consider the following statements:**

1. Hemu, initially a market superintendent under Islam Shah, rose to become a powerful commander, undefeated in twenty-two battles before the encounter at Panipat.
2. The Mughal victory at Panipat, although initially in Hemu's favor, was secured when an arrow struck Hemu in the eye, leading to his incapacitation and the subsequent rout of the Afghan forces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Hemu's remarkable rise to power.  Starting from a humble position as a market superintendent under Islam Shah, he demonstrated exceptional military prowess, achieving an undefeated record in twenty-two battles. This rapid ascent highlights his strategic abilities and battlefield acumen, making him a formidable opponent for the young Akbar.  The detail about his initial position adds context to his achievement.

Statement 2 correctly recounts the pivotal moment in the Battle of Panipat that secured the Mughal victory.  Despite initial successes for Hemu's forces, the battle turned decisively when an arrow struck him in the eye, causing him to faint. This unexpected event led to the collapse of Afghan leadership and a subsequent rout of their army. The description emphasizes the role of chance in military history and the fragility of even the most successful military campaigns.  The details of the battle's turning point are historically accurate.


**4. With reference to Akbar's early conflicts with the nobility (1556-1567), consider the following statements:**

1. Bairam Khan, Akbar's tutor and a loyal officer of Humayun, initially maintained control over the nobility but eventually faced a rebellion due to his perceived Shia leanings and the appointment of his supporters to high offices.
2. Adham Khan, son of Akbar's foster-mother Maham Anaga, after being removed from command in Malwa, murdered the acting wazir, leading to his execution by Akbar in 1561.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately portrays the complex relationship between Akbar and Bairam Khan. While Bairam Khan initially played a crucial role in consolidating Akbar's power and expanding the empire, his actions, including the perceived favoritism towards Shia supporters and his assertive governance style, created resentment among powerful nobles.  These factors contributed significantly to the eventual rebellion against him.  The mention of his Shia leanings adds a nuanced perspective to the political dynamics of the time.

Statement 2 correctly describes the events leading to Adham Khan's execution.  Following his removal from command in Malwa, Adham Khan's ambition and arrogance led him to commit the heinous act of murdering the acting wazir. Akbar's swift and decisive response in executing Adham Khan underscores the young emperor's determination to assert his authority and maintain order within his court.  The specific detail about the murder and the year of execution contribute to the historical accuracy.


**5. With reference to Akbar's conquest of Malwa, consider the following statements:**

1.  Baz Bahadur, the ruler of Malwa, was known for his patronage of music and poetry, but his neglect of the army led to his defeat by Adham Khan, son of Akbar's foster-mother.
2.  Following Baz Bahadur's defeat, Rupmati, his consort, committed suicide rather than falling into the hands of Adham Khan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately portrays Baz Bahadur as a ruler known for his artistic patronage but militarily unprepared.  His focus on music and poetry, while reflecting a cultural sophistication, ultimately proved to be a weakness in the face of the Mughal invasion. Adham Khan's victory highlights the contrast between cultural refinement and military might. The details about Baz Bahadur's strengths and weaknesses provide a balanced historical perspective.

Statement 2 also correctly describes Rupmati's tragic fate. Faced with the prospect of capture and confinement in Adham Khan's harem, she chose suicide as a means of preserving her dignity and avoiding a life of humiliation. This act of defiance underscores the values of honor and independence in Rajput culture.  The description of Rupmati's choice adds an emotional and culturally significant dimension to the historical event.


**6. With reference to Akbar's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar initially adopted Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system but later shifted to an annual assessment due to difficulties with the central price schedule.
2. The annual assessment, while intending to ensure fairer revenue collection, faced challenges due to dishonesty among ganungos and difficulties for both the peasantry and the state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Akbar's initial adoption of Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system and the subsequent shift to an annual assessment.  The difficulties encountered with the central price schedule, which often resulted in delays and hardship for the peasantry, prompted Akbar to seek a more adaptable approach.  This demonstrates Akbar's pragmatic approach to governance and his willingness to modify existing systems to better suit the needs of his empire.

Statement 2 correctly points out the problems associated with the annual assessment. While intended to improve fairness, the system faced significant challenges due to the dishonesty of ganungos (local revenue officials) who often concealed the true extent of agricultural produce.  The annual assessments also created difficulties for both the peasantry and the state, illustrating the complexities of implementing effective revenue systems in a large and diverse empire.  The challenges highlight the practical limitations of the annual assessment.


**7. With reference to Akbar's relations with the Rajputs, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bhara Mal, the ruler of Amber, strengthened the alliance between the Mughals and the Kachhawaha Rajputs.
2.  Akbar's Rajput policy, which included matrimonial alliances and granting high positions to Rajput nobles, was a significant factor in the consolidation and expansion of the Mughal empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the strategic marriage between Akbar and Harkha Bai. This matrimonial alliance with the Kachhawaha Rajputs not only cemented a personal bond but also formed a crucial political alliance, strengthening Akbar's position in Rajasthan and facilitating access to Rajput military resources.  The marriage served both political and social purposes.

Statement 2 correctly assesses the overall success of Akbar's Rajput policy. By strategically utilizing matrimonial alliances, granting high positions to Rajput nobles, and demonstrating religious tolerance, Akbar effectively secured the loyalty of powerful Rajput rulers, thereby significantly contributing to the consolidation and expansion of the Mughal empire.  This policy highlights Akbar's shrewd political strategy and his understanding of the importance of forging alliances with powerful regional actors.


**8. With reference to the Battle of Haldighati, consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the main participants in the Battle of Haldighati. The battle was primarily a conflict between the Mughal forces and Rana Pratap of Mewar, although the Rana's army also included an Afghan contingent.  This fact underscores the complex political alliances and the multi-ethnic nature of the armies involved.  The inclusion of the Afghan contingent adds a layer of complexity to the battle's dynamics.

Statement 2 accurately describes the outcome of the Battle of Haldighati and Rana Pratap's subsequent strategy.  Although Rana Pratap's forces achieved initial successes, they were eventually defeated, leading Rana Pratap to shift his tactics to guerrilla warfare. This strategic shift demonstrates Rana Pratap's adaptability and his resilience in the face of a superior Mughal force.  The description of the battle's outcome and its impact on Rana Pratap's strategy is historically accurate.

The strategic importance of these territories is evident in their geographical location and their role in controlling access to the Mughal empire.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the significance of Akbar's acquisition of Qandhar.  The conquest of Qandhar in 1595 not only fortified the Mughal northwestern frontier but also secured a vital trade route linking India to Central Asia, facilitating the flow of goods and enhancing the empire's economic prosperity.  The strategic and economic implications of Qandhar's acquisition are significant.


**10. With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar abolished the jizya tax, pilgrim tax, and the practice of forcible conversion of prisoners of war, laying the foundation for an empire based on religious tolerance.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, established in 1575, initially focused on discussions among Muslim theologians but later expanded to include representatives of various religious faiths.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The abolition of the jizya tax (poll tax on non-Muslims), pilgrim tax, and forcible conversions represented a radical departure from traditional Islamic practice, laying the foundation for a more inclusive and equitable empire.  These actions underscore Akbar's commitment to religious pluralism and his vision of a unified empire.

Statement 2 correctly outlines the evolution of the Ibadat Khana.  Initially intended as a forum for discussions among Muslim theologians, it later evolved into a space where representatives of various faiths, including Christians, Zoroastrians, Hindus, and Jains, engaged in religious and philosophical debates.  This expansion reflects Akbar's growing interest in diverse religious perspectives and his pursuit of religious harmony.  The evolution of the Ibadat Khana demonstrates Akbar's intellectual curiosity and his approach to religious dialogue.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Akbar's meticulous time management and his approach to governance. The jharoka darshan was a crucial element of his public image and accessibility, while the ghusalkhana provided a more private setting for consultations with his ministers.  This demonstrates Akbar's understanding of the importance of both public relations and confidential political maneuvering.  The description aligns perfectly with the text's account of Akbar's daily schedule and administrative structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Rana of Mewar did indeed resist Mughal suzerainty,  the statement oversimplifies the Rajput response to Akbar's conquests.  Many Rajput rulers, while initially resistant, eventually accepted Akbar's authority, often through a combination of military pressure and strategic alliances, including matrimonial relations. The passage explicitly mentions that following the conquest of Chittor, *most* Rajput rulers accepted Akbar's suzerainty;  it was not a universal and immediate acceptance.  This detail makes statement 2 factually inaccurate and a misleading distractor.


**2. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy and its consequences, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's policy towards the Rajputs involved exclusively matrimonial alliances to solidify political relationships, with no other methods employed to secure their loyalty.
2.  The Battle of Haldighati, fought between Akbar's forces led by Raja Man Singh and Rana Pratap of Mewar, decisively ended Mewar's resistance against Mughal rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Akbar's Rajput policy was multifaceted. While matrimonial alliances were a significant component, aimed at forging personal bonds and integrating Rajput elites into the Mughal system, it also involved granting high ranks and positions to Rajput leaders, offering religious freedom, and employing a blend of military pressure and diplomacy.  The passage clearly shows that Akbar's approach wasn't solely reliant on marriage.  This makes statement 1 a strong distractor, playing on a partial truth to mislead.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Battle of Haldighati was a significant engagement but did not definitively end Mewar's resistance.  While Rana Pratap suffered a tactical defeat, he continued his guerilla warfare against the Mughals for many years, never fully submitting to Mughal authority.  The passage explicitly states that the battle was not a conclusive victory and that Rana Pratap continued his struggle.  This makes statement 2 a misleading distractor.


**3. With reference to the Mughal administrative structure under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar divided his empire into twelve subas in 1580, each governed by a subedar and a team of officials including a diwan (finance minister), bakhshi (military paymaster), sadr (religious affairs), qazi (judge), and waqia-navis (news reporter).
2.  The position of Mir Bakshi in the Mughal administrative system was primarily concerned with collecting taxes from farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly outlines the provincial administrative structure under Akbar.  The detailed description of officials and their responsibilities reflects Akbar's emphasis on a robust and centralized administrative system with a system of checks and balances. This accurately reflects the information presented in the source material.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Mir Bakshi's responsibilities were primarily military. He oversaw the military departments, including recruitment, pay, and equipment. Tax collection was the responsibility of the diwan.  This highlights a common misconception about Mughal administrative roles, making statement 2 a well-designed distractor.


**4.  With reference to Aurangzeb's Deccan policy and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jai Singh's Bijapur campaign in 1665 was a resounding success, leading to significant territorial gains for the Mughals and weakening the united front of the Deccan states.
2.  Aurangzeb's decision to execute Sambhaji, Shivaji's son, was a strategic political blunder, fueling Maratha resistance and prolonging the conflict in the Deccan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jai Singh's 1665 Bijapur campaign was a failure, failing to capture Bijapur due to lack of siege equipment and the united resistance of the Deccan states.  The campaign had the opposite effect, reinforcing the Deccan's united front against the Mughals. This is a key point showing a misunderstanding of Aurangzeb’s early Deccan policy and its failures.

Statement 2 is correct.  The execution of Sambhaji is widely considered a major strategic error by Aurangzeb.  It removed a potential negotiating partner and created a martyr figure for the Marathas, galvanizing their resistance and leading to a protracted and ultimately unsuccessful war.  The passage clearly points to this as a significant mistake in Aurangzeb's Deccan strategy.


**5. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur is known for his patronage of Sanskrit and Marathi literature, his interest in music (composing the *Kitib-i-Nawras*), and his tolerant policies towards both Hindu and Muslim communities.
2.  Golconda was a significant center for Urdu literature, with Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah being a notable poet who introduced secular themes into his work, contributing to the development of Dakhini Urdu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the cultural achievements of the Deccan sultanates. Statement 1 correctly identifies Ibrahim Adil Shah II's multifaceted patronage of arts, literature, and his religious tolerance.  The details provided about his musical contributions and his policies highlight the complex cultural landscape of the Deccan.

Statement 2 similarly highlights the significant role of Golconda in the development of Urdu literature.  The description of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah's poetic contributions and his introduction of secular themes accurately reflects the historical record.  Both statements showcase the rich and diverse cultural contributions of the Deccan region, making (c) the correct option.  The detailed information in both statements, particularly the names of literary works and rulers, makes simple guessing unlikely.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on various aspects of Mughal history, particularly the reign of Aurangzeb and the decline of the empire.


**1. With reference to the Mughal Jagirdari system during Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. The annexation of Bijapur and Golconda led to a shortage of easily manageable jagirs, as Aurangzeb retained the best ones for direct management to fund the war effort.
2.  The reduction in the number of horses and soldiers a mansabdar was expected to maintain, as implemented by Shah Jahan, successfully addressed the long-term problem of jagir shortages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Aurangzeb's conquests of Bijapur and Golconda resulted in a shortage of easily manageable jagirs because he kept the best ones for his own direct control ("khalisa") to finance the war. This created a scarcity of desirable jagirs for the nobility.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Shah Jahan did attempt to alleviate the jagir shortage by reducing the military obligations of mansabdars (expressed as a reduction in the number of horses and soldiers they had to maintain), the text clearly indicates that this measure did *not* solve the underlying problem. The shortage persisted and became particularly acute during Aurangzeb's later reign.  The temporary fix did not address the root causes of the issue.  The problem remained a significant contributing factor to the decline of the Mughal empire.


**2. With reference to Aurangzeb's policies towards the Marathas, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's execution of Sambhaji was a strategic blunder, as it eliminated a potential negotiating partner and fueled further Maratha resistance.
2.  Despite granting numerous high-level mansabs to Maratha sardars, Aurangzeb consistently refused to entrust them with positions of significant political responsibility, hindering their integration into the Mughal system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect Aurangzeb's flawed approach to the Maratha problem.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the execution of Sambhaji as a critical mistake.  The text highlights that this action removed a key figure with whom negotiations could have been conducted, ultimately exacerbating the conflict and strengthening Maratha resolve.

Statement 2 is also accurate.  Despite appointing Marathas to high-ranking mansabs—even more than Rajputs at the highest levels—Aurangzeb deliberately withheld positions of trust and responsibility from them. This lack of genuine integration into the Mughal political system fueled Maratha resentment and contributed to the ongoing conflict.  The distrust was a significant factor in preventing a lasting peace.


**3. With reference to the economic conditions during the later Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The expansion of the area under zabti (a system of land measurement) and an increase in the total cultivated area indicate a robust and rapidly expanding agricultural economy during the 17th century.
2.  The rising prices in the first half of the 17th century, coupled with the heavy land revenue demands, exacerbated the financial difficulties faced by the Mughal nobility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions an expansion in the area under zabti and some evidence of increased cultivation, it simultaneously points out that agricultural production was not expanding as rapidly as needed.  Factors such as soil exhaustion and heavy land revenue hindered faster growth.  The text suggests a slower, less robust expansion than a simple reading of the land statistics might imply.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that rising prices in the first half of the 17th century, combined with the substantial land revenue demands (often half the produce), significantly worsened the financial situation of the Mughal nobility. This economic pressure contributed to their difficulties in maintaining their troops and fulfilling their obligations.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Aurangzeb's religious policies:**

1. Aurangzeb's re-imposition of the jizya tax was primarily motivated by a desire to convert the Hindu population to Islam through economic pressure.
2.  The destruction of Hindu temples under Aurangzeb's reign was solely a consequence of his strict adherence to Islamic law, as outlined in the Sharia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly refutes the idea that the jizya tax was intended to force conversions through economic hardship. It argues that the tax's incidence was light, and exemptions were granted to many.  The primary motivations were political and ideological, aiming to consolidate Muslim support and assert the Islamic character of the state.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Aurangzeb's religious beliefs undoubtedly influenced his actions, the text suggests that the destruction of temples had both religious and political motivations.  It was not solely a matter of strict adherence to the Sharia, but also a tool to consolidate power, punish opponents, and send a message of dominance. The destruction was often used as a political tool during periods of conflict or rebellion.


**5. With reference to the administrative structure of the Mughal Empire under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's division of the empire into twelve subas in 1580 established a system of checks and balances by appointing multiple officials (subedar, diwan, bakhshi, etc.) to each province.
2.  Akbar's policy of establishing matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers was contingent upon the Rajputs accepting Mughal suzerainty and paying personal homage to him.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text details Akbar's administrative reforms, including the division of the empire into twelve subas and the appointment of multiple officials within each province. This system was designed to create a balance of power and prevent any single official from becoming too powerful. The multiple officials acted as checks on each other's power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Akbar did forge matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers, the text explicitly states that he did *not* make these alliances a precondition for accepting Mughal suzerainty.  Some Rajput rulers maintained their independence despite not entering into such alliances. The text highlights the example of the Hadas of Ranthambhor.  Akbar's strategy was more nuanced and flexible than simply demanding marriage as a condition of submission.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember, the difficulty is intended to be high, requiring in-depth knowledge of Mughal history.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Aurangzeb's reign:**

1. Aurangzeb's religious policy, while orthodox, was inconsistently applied, leading to both the alienation of some Hindu subjects and a failure to fully unite Muslims behind him.
2. The decline of the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb's successors was primarily due to his religious policies, which weakened the empire's social and economic fabric.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aurangzeb's religious policies, while rooted in orthodox Sunni Islam, were not uniformly implemented and often contradicted his pragmatic political needs.  His actions, such as the re-imposition of jizya and the destruction of temples, alienated significant sections of the Hindu population. However, his attempts to enforce Islamic law did not fully unite the Muslim population either, as his policies were often perceived as overly strict or impractical for the diverse Indian context.  His reign shows a tension between religious zeal and the need for political stability—a key factor in the empire's eventual decline.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb's religious policies contributed to the weakening of the empire, attributing the decline solely to them is an oversimplification. The decline was a complex process involving multiple factors including economic issues (stagnant agricultural productivity, trade disruptions), social fragmentation (growing regional autonomy, weakening of central authority), military weaknesses (decline in artillery and cavalry effectiveness), and institutional decay (inefficient administration, corruption).  Aurangzeb's policies exacerbated existing problems, but they were not the sole cause.  The long and costly Deccan campaigns significantly drained the empire's resources and manpower, further accelerating the decline.


**2. With reference to the Mughal nobility under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  The proportion of Hindus in the Mughal nobility under Akbar, while increasing, remained a relatively small percentage of the total nobility even at its peak.
2. The inclusion of Rajput elites in the Mughal nobility primarily served to enhance the military strength of the empire, neglecting other aspects of governance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Akbar actively incorporated Hindus, especially Rajputs, into his nobility, their numbers, while significant for their influence, never constituted a majority.  Estimates suggest that Hindus comprised around 16% of the nobility in 1594. This shows Akbar's policy was a strategic move to integrate powerful groups, but it did not fundamentally alter the demographic composition of the elite.  The significant presence of Rajput leaders like Man Singh and Birbal, however, belies the purely numerical representation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the military contribution of Rajput nobles was significant, their inclusion in the Mughal nobility extended beyond military matters.  Rajput elites played crucial roles in revenue administration (Todar Mal) and held other positions of power and influence within the court and administration, demonstrating the multifaceted nature of Akbar's integration strategy. Akbar aimed for a broader political and administrative integration, leveraging the skills and networks of the Rajput elite.


**3. With reference to the Battle of Panipat (1526), consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's victory at Panipat was primarily due to the superior numbers of his army, which overwhelmed Ibrahim Lodi's forces.
2. The use of artillery at Panipat marked a significant turning point in warfare in India, showcasing the effectiveness of gunpowder technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the numerical disparity between Babur's and Ibrahim Lodi's armies was present, Babur's victory was not solely due to superior numbers.  Babur's strategic deployment, the effective use of artillery and flanking maneuvers, and the innovative battlefield tactics played a more decisive role.  Ibrahim Lodi's army, despite its larger size, lacked the strategic depth and tactical flexibility of Babur's forces.

Statement 2 is correct. The Battle of Panipat is significant for its demonstration of the power of gunpowder technology in a large-scale battle in India. While gunpowder was known in India before Babur, his effective use of artillery against Ibrahim Lodi's army marked a turning point.  This battle signaled a shift towards more technologically advanced warfare, favoring rulers who could afford and deploy artillery effectively, leading to the decline of smaller kingdoms.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Mughal economic system:**

1. The Mughal administration at the district level proved remarkably resilient, with aspects of its structure surviving and influencing later British administration.
2. The Mughal nobility's involvement in commercial activities was minimal, with their primary source of income remaining land ownership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mughal administrative system, particularly at the district level, displayed remarkable tenacity.  Its structures and practices demonstrated a level of resilience that extended beyond the Mughal period.  Elements of the Mughal administrative system were adapted and integrated into the British administration, showcasing the enduring impact of Mughal governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While land ownership was the primary source of income for the Mughal nobility, their involvement in commercial activities was substantial.  Many nobles invested in trade, lent money at interest, and participated in various commercial ventures, directly or indirectly.  This involvement demonstrates that the Mughal elite were not solely reliant on land revenue and actively participated in the broader economy, challenging the notion of their being exclusively land-based.  Abul Fazl’s advice to nobles regarding commercial speculation further supports this.


**5. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The neglect of modern science and technology by the Mughal ruling class significantly contributed to the empire's decline.
2.  The socio-economic forces of disintegration were already strong by the time Aurangzeb ascended the throne, limiting his ability to reverse the decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mughal ruling class's relative lack of interest in and investment in modern science and technology compared to contemporary European powers played a role in the empire's eventual decline. This technological gap contributed to military vulnerabilities and an inability to adapt to changing warfare dynamics.  The lack of innovation in various sectors also hampered economic progress.

Statement 2 is correct. The seeds of the Mughal Empire's decline were sown long before Aurangzeb's reign.  Socio-economic factors like growing regional power struggles, weakening central authority, and the emergence of new regional powers (Marathas) created stresses within the empire.  Aurangzeb inherited these deep-seated problems, and his policies, while contributing to the decline, were not the sole cause of its downfall.  The empire's fundamental structural weaknesses made effective reforms challenging.


**1. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom's administrative structure under Mahmud Gawan, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan divided the kingdom into eight provinces, each governed by a tarafdar, and standardized the salaries and obligations of nobles.
2.  Nobles receiving salaries in the form of jagirs were responsible for collecting land revenue and managing expenses, while a portion of land (khalisa) was reserved for the Sultan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms within the Bahmani Kingdom.  Statement 1 correctly describes his division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each under a tarafdar, and his efforts to standardize the financial responsibilities and compensation of the nobility. This demonstrates his attempt to create a more efficient and centralized system. Statement 2 is also accurate, detailing the system of jagir assignments for noble salaries, the nobles' responsibility for land revenue collection within their assigned territories, and the reservation of khalisa lands for the Sultan's expenses.  The khalisa lands acted as a direct source of revenue for the Sultan, independent of the jagir system, further strengthening central authority.  There is no contradiction between the statements; they are complementary aspects of Gawan's administrative reforms. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.  The comprehensive nature of the reforms, encompassing both provincial organization and revenue management, is crucial for understanding the scope of Gawan's influence on the Bahmani administration.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire's post-Deva Raya II period, consider the following statements:**

1. The absence of a clear succession law led to a series of civil wars and the rise of powerful ministers who exploited the populace.
2.  The Saluva dynasty, succeeding the earlier Vijayanagara dynasty, oversaw the re-establishment of internal order and laid the groundwork for Krishna Deva Raya's reign.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly reflect the state of the Vijayanagara Empire after the death of Deva Raya II. Statement 1 accurately depicts the power vacuum created by the lack of a clear succession law, leading to internal conflicts and the empowerment of ambitious ministers who used their influence to extract heavy taxes and presents from the people, weakening the central authority of the Raya.  This internal strife significantly destabilized the empire. Statement 2 is also correct, highlighting the Saluva dynasty's role in restoring order after the period of chaos and civil war that followed Deva Raya II's death.  The Saluva dynasty, while short-lived, provided a period of stability before the rise of the Tuluva dynasty under Krishna Deva Raya, who ultimately consolidated the empire's power once more.  The sequence of events—civil war, the rise of powerful ministers, the Saluva interlude, and Krishna Deva Raya's subsequent consolidation—is a crucial aspect of understanding the dynamics of the Vijayanagara Empire during this period. Options (a), (b), and (d) are inaccurate as they fail to recognize the validity of both statements, which together paint a complete picture of the empire's internal struggles and the subsequent restoration of order.


**3. With reference to the religious policies of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax and pilgrim tax aimed to establish religious equality and consolidate his empire's multi-religious base.
2. The Ibadat Khana, initially a space for Muslim theological discussions, evolved into a platform for interfaith dialogues, sparking controversies and fueling rumors about Akbar's religious beliefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's religious policies. Statement 1 correctly identifies the abolition of the jizya (poll tax on non-Muslims) and pilgrim tax as key steps in Akbar's strategy to promote religious harmony and strengthen the unity of his diverse empire.  These actions were not merely symbolic; they aimed to dismantle discriminatory practices and create a more inclusive society, thereby fostering loyalty among his Hindu subjects. Statement 2 accurately describes the evolution of the Ibadat Khana (House of Worship).  Initially intended for discussions among Muslim theologians, it later expanded to include representatives of various faiths, leading to debates on fundamental religious doctrines. This openness, while intended to foster understanding, also generated controversy and rumors about Akbar's own religious leanings, highlighting the complexities of his approach to religious tolerance.  The combination of these two statements reveals the multifaceted nature of Akbar's religious policy—a blend of practical political strategies and intellectual explorations of religious truth, often leading to both positive outcomes and unintended consequences. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to account for the accuracy of both statements, which are distinct yet interconnected elements of Akbar's reign.


**4. With reference to the Mughal administrative system under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Subah system, established in 1580, divided the empire into twelve provinces, each headed by a Subedar and supported by various officials to ensure checks and balances.
2. Akbar's Rajput policy, while incorporating Rajput rulers into the Mughal nobility through matrimonial alliances, extended beyond such alliances, as seen in the relationships with the Hadas of Ranthambhor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of Akbar's administrative system. Statement 1 correctly outlines the Subah system, which divided the empire into twelve provinces (Subahs) with a clear hierarchical structure. The Subedar, along with the Diwan (finance minister), Bakhshi (paymaster), Sadr (religious judge), Qazi (judicial officer), and Waqia-navis (news reporter), formed a system of checks and balances intended to enhance efficiency and prevent corruption.  The Subah system was a critical component of Akbar's centralized administrative reforms.  Statement 2 accurately points out the nuanced nature of Akbar's Rajput policy. While matrimonial alliances were a significant tool in forging alliances with Rajput rulers (as seen with the Kachwahas of Amber),  Akbar also cultivated relationships with Rajput houses that did not involve marriage, as demonstrated by his dealings with the Hadas of Ranthambhor. This reveals the flexibility and pragmatism of Akbar's approach to consolidating his power base.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the validity of both statements which, when considered together, provide a comprehensive understanding of Akbar's administrative strategies. The combination of centralized provincial governance and flexible strategies in forging alliances with powerful Rajput clans was key to Akbar's success in consolidating the Mughal empire.


**5. With reference to the Deccan Sultanates, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bijapur Sultanate, under Ibrahim Adil Shah II, fostered a culture of tolerance, evident in his patronage of both Hindu and Muslim saints and temples, including Pandharpur.
2.  Golconda, under Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, saw a flourishing of Urdu literature, with poets drawing inspiration from Persian, Hindi, and Telugu, marking a significant development in the language's evolution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the cultural contributions of the Deccan Sultanates. Statement 1 correctly highlights the tolerant policies of Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur, who actively patronized both Hindu and Muslim religious figures and institutions. His support for Pandharpur, a significant center of the Bhakti movement, demonstrates his inclusive approach to governance and his understanding of the importance of religious harmony in maintaining social stability. Statement 2 accurately describes the significant development of Urdu literature in Golconda during the reign of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah.  The Sultan's patronage, combined with the influence of Persian, Hindi, and Telugu, fostered the evolution of a distinct Dakhini Urdu, showcasing the syncretic nature of Deccan culture.  The development of Urdu as a literary language in the Deccan is a significant cultural achievement.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the substantial cultural contributions of both Sultanates, reflecting a broader pattern of religious and cultural synthesis in the Deccan region.  The combined statements showcase the rich cultural landscape of the Deccan Sultanates, highlighting their contributions to religious tolerance and literary development.


**6. With reference to the reign of Sher Shah Suri, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms included a standardized land revenue system based on accurate land measurement and crop assessment.
2. Despite his focus on administrative efficiency, Sher Shah Suri's reign was characterized by a continuation of the jizya tax on Hindus and a nobility largely composed of Afghans.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Sher Shah Suri's reign. Statement 1 correctly highlights Sher Shah Suri's significant administrative reforms, particularly his land revenue system.  This system involved accurate land measurement, crop assessment based on productivity, and a standardized system for collecting revenue from peasants.  This efficiency contrasted with the often chaotic systems of his predecessors. Statement 2 is also correct, highlighting that despite his administrative acumen, Sher Shah Suri did not significantly alter the existing religious policies. The jizya tax on Hindus remained in place, and his nobility was overwhelmingly composed of Afghans, reflecting his focus on his ethnic group.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.  The combined statements showcase the complex nature of Sher Shah Suri's reign: a period of administrative modernization alongside a continuation of existing social and religious structures that favored his own ethnic group. This offers insights into the limitations of his reforms and their impact on broader societal relations.


**7. With reference to the early expansion of the Mughal Empire under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. The conquest of Malwa, initially led by Adham Khan, saw Baz Bahadur forced to flee, eventually seeking refuge and becoming a Mughal mansabdar.
2. The conquest of Garha-Katanga, following the death of Rani Durgavati, resulted in significant plunder for the Mughal governor Asaf Khan, who was later forced to disgorge his ill-gotten gains by Akbar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe events during the early expansion of the Mughal Empire under Akbar. Statement 1 correctly recounts the conquest of Malwa. The initial Mughal campaign, led by Adham Khan, resulted in Baz Bahadur's defeat and subsequent flight.  Significantly, Baz Bahadur later submitted to Akbar and was appointed a Mughal mansabdar, demonstrating Akbar's pragmatic approach to incorporating defeated rulers into his administration. Statement 2 accurately describes the conquest of Garha-Katanga.  Rani Durgavati's valiant defense against the Mughals ended with her death and the subsequent conquest of the kingdom. Asaf Khan, the Mughal governor, amassed considerable wealth through plunder but was later compelled by Akbar to return the illegally acquired riches, demonstrating Akbar's commitment to controlling the behavior of his governors and enforcing accountability.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the validity of both statements.  These events, when considered together, provide insights into Akbar's military strategies, his approach to incorporating defeated rulers, and his ability to control the actions of his officials, showcasing his consolidation of power.


**8. With reference to the Mughal nobility under Akbar and his successors, consider the following statements:**

1. Under Akbar, Hindus constituted a significant portion of the nobility, with Rajputs forming a prominent group, although their overall proportion in 1594 remained relatively low.
2. The Mughal nobility, while initially dominated by foreigners, gradually became more India-born under Jahangir and Shah Jahan, with the Marathas emerging as a new group during this period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the composition and evolution of the Mughal nobility. Statement 1 correctly notes the inclusion of Hindus, particularly Rajputs, in the Mughal nobility under Akbar.  While their overall percentage in 1594 was relatively small, their presence was significant, especially considering the influence of key figures like Raja Man Singh and Raja Birbal.  The integration of Rajputs into the nobility was a crucial aspect of Akbar's strategy to consolidate his power and foster alliances. Statement 2 correctly describes the shift in the composition of the Mughal nobility over time. While initially many nobles were of foreign origin, the proportion of India-born nobles increased substantially under Jahangir and Shah Jahan.  The emergence of the Marathas as a new group within the nobility during this period is also accurate, reflecting the growing influence of the Maratha kingdom in the Deccan.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.  The combined statements provide a nuanced understanding of how the Mughal nobility evolved, reflecting both the emperor's policies and the shifting political landscape of India.  The increasing inclusion of Indian groups, including the Marathas, demonstrates the dynamic nature of the Mughal state and its interactions with regional power structures.


**9. With reference to the Mughal-Rajput relations under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bhara Mal of Amber, was a significant step in solidifying the Mughal-Kachwaha alliance, also involving the upbringing of Prince Danyal in Amber.
2.  Akbar's Rajput policy, while emphasizing matrimonial alliances, did not make them a precondition for acceptance into the Mughal fold, as evidenced by the Hadas of Ranthambhor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe Akbar's Rajput policy. Statement 1 correctly highlights the importance of Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bhara Mal of Amber. This marriage served as a crucial element in cementing the alliance between the Mughals and the Kachwahas, a powerful Rajput clan.  The act of sending Prince Danyal to be raised in Amber further strengthened the personal bond between Akbar and the Kachwaha family. Statement 2 correctly notes that while matrimonial alliances were a key strategy in Akbar's Rajput policy, they were not a strict prerequisite for acceptance into the Mughal system.  The Hadas of Ranthambhor, who maintained a strong relationship with Akbar without a matrimonial alliance, demonstrate the flexibility and pragmatism of Akbar's approach.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.  These statements, when considered together, provide a comprehensive understanding of Akbar's successful strategy in forging alliances with Rajput rulers, showing a balance of strategic marriages and pragmatic diplomacy.  The flexibility in his approach was critical to his success in integrating powerful Rajput houses into the Mughal framework without resorting to purely coercive measures.


**10. With reference to the events leading to Aurangzeb's accession to the Mughal throne, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's victory at Samugarh was decisive in his struggle against Dara Shukoh, leading to Dara's flight and eventual capture and execution.
2.  Aurangzeb's subsequent campaigns against Shuja and Murad resulted in their defeats and deaths, ultimately consolidating his control over the Mughal Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the key events in Aurangzeb's rise to power. Statement 1 correctly describes the Battle of Samugarh as a pivotal moment in Aurangzeb's struggle against Dara Shukoh. Aurangzeb's victory in this battle forced Dara's flight, ultimately leading to his capture and execution, eliminating a major rival in the succession struggle. Statement 2 is also correct, highlighting Aurangzeb's subsequent military successes against his other brothers, Shuja and Murad.  Aurangzeb's campaigns against these brothers resulted in their defeats and deaths, effectively removing any remaining significant opposition to his claim to the throne.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.   The combined statements provide a clear timeline of Aurangzeb's military victories that secured his position as the Mughal emperor, demonstrating his ruthlessness and strategic acumen in eliminating rivals and consolidating his power. This sequence of events is essential for understanding the complexities of the Mughal succession crisis and Aurangzeb's ultimate triumph.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is followed by a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Mughal Mansabdari system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 'Zat' rank determined a Mansabdar's position in the hierarchy and his salary, while the 'Sawar' rank indicated the number of horsemen he was obligated to maintain.
2.  Mansabdars holding a 'Sawar' rank of 1000 or more were designated as nobles (Umara) throughout the Mughal period, regardless of their 'Zat' rank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the dual nature of the Mansab rank.  The 'Zat' rank denoted the officer's personal status and determined his salary, while the 'Sawar' rank specified the number of cavalrymen he had to maintain. This system intricately linked military obligations with social standing and remuneration, a key feature of the Mughal administrative structure.  The relationship between 'Zat' and 'Sawar' ranks was complex and could vary, adding to the system's sophistication.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a high 'Sawar' rank was indeed a significant indicator of nobility, it wasn't the sole determinant.  The text mentions that in the 17th century, Mansabdars with 1000 or more 'Sawar' rank were designated as nobles.  The statement incorrectly generalizes this to the entire Mughal period, ignoring potential variations across different reigns and the importance of the 'Zat' rank in determining overall status.  A high 'Zat' rank, even with a lower 'Sawar' rank, could still confer significant status and influence.


**2. With reference to the Mughal administrative system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jama-dami was a register maintained by the revenue department, detailing the assessed income of various areas in rupees.
2.  The month-scale, implemented to address financial strain, reduced the quota of troopers and horses Mansabdars had to maintain, irrespective of their jagir income.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jama-dami was indeed a register of assessed income, but it was *not* in rupees. The text explicitly states that it was calculated in dams (40 dams to a rupee), reflecting the complexities of the Mughal monetary system and its impact on revenue assessment.  This detail is crucial for understanding the intricacies of Mughal financial administration and the challenges faced in managing the vast empire.

Statement 2 is correct.  The month-scale was a crucial reform introduced to address the growing financial strain on the Mughal state due to the increasing number of Mansabdars.  It directly impacted the military obligations of Mansabdars by reducing the number of horses and troopers they had to maintain. Importantly, the text clarifies that this scale applied not just to those receiving jagirs (land grants), but also to those paid in cash, showcasing the system's broader reach and its attempt to manage costs across various payment methods.


**3. With reference to the Mughal army, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahadis were individual troopers directly recruited by the emperors, receiving salaries comparable to Mansabdars.
2.  The Mughal cavalry, primarily composed of Mansabdars, was supplemented by a corps of royal bodyguards (welashakis) who served exclusively on foot.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Ahadis were indeed individual troopers directly recruited by the emperors and considered a highly trusted corps. However, their salaries were *significantly higher* than other troopers, not comparable to Mansabdars. The text highlights this difference, emphasizing the elite status of the Ahadis within the Mughal military structure.  This distinction reflects the emperor's need for a loyal and skilled personal force.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mughal army heavily relied on the cavalry provided by Mansabdars.  However, the text explicitly mentions the existence of welashakis, a corps of royal bodyguards who, while cavalrymen, served on foot within the citadel and palace, providing a crucial layer of security for the emperor and the imperial household.  This highlights the diverse composition of the Mughal army and the different roles fulfilled within its structure.


**4.  Consider the following statements regarding the economic and social conditions during the Mughal empire:**

1.  The majority of peasants owned the land they cultivated and paid land revenue at fixed, unchanging rates throughout their lives.
2.  European travelers consistently reported widespread prosperity among the common people, contrasting sharply with the lavish lifestyles of the ruling classes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some peasants were khudkashts (cultivators owning the land they tilled), this wasn't universally true.  The text describes a complex system of land tenure, including tenants (muzarians) who paid higher rates and faced potential displacement.  The land revenue rates also weren't static; they varied based on factors like crop yields and assessment methods. This points to the significant economic inequalities prevalent within the rural landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  European accounts consistently highlighted the stark contrast between the opulence of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty among ordinary people – peasants, artisans, and laborers.  The text describes their accounts of the poor's limited clothing and basic diets, indicating a substantial gap in living standards.  The statement misrepresents these accounts by suggesting widespread prosperity among the common people.


**5. With reference to the reign of Shah Jahan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The area under cultivation and the production of cash crops significantly increased, leading to a corresponding increase in the Jama-dami that outpaced inflation.
2.  Despite the increase in the Jama-dami during his reign, the month-scale system continued to be used to manage the financial obligations of Mansabdars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Shah Jahan's reign did see an increase in cultivated land and cash crop production,  the resulting increase in Jama-dami (jagir income) broadly *kept pace* with inflation, not exceeding it. The text emphasizes this point, indicating that the economic gains were largely offset by rising prices. This nuanced observation is crucial for understanding the limitations of economic growth during this period.

Statement 2 is correct. The month-scale system, initially implemented to address financial strain, continued to be used under Shah Jahan.  The text explicitly states that this system wasn't directly linked to declines in jagir income, applying to both jagir-holders and those receiving cash salaries.  The continued use of the month-scale underscores the persistent challenges in managing the Mughal empire's finances, even during a period of relative prosperity.


**1. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Gawan, a prime minister of the Bahmani kingdom, implemented administrative reforms that included dividing the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each governed by a tarafdar.  His reforms also involved fixing the salaries and obligations of nobles, payable in cash or through jagirs.
2. The Bahmani kingdom's decline was primarily caused by internal strife among the nobles, who were divided into Deccanis (long-established residents) and foreigners (afghans, also called gharibs), culminating in its fragmentation into five principalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms are well-documented. He implemented a system of eight provinces (tarafs), each under a tarafdar, aimed at improving governance and revenue collection.  His standardization of noble salaries and obligations, with the option of cash or jagir payment, reflects a significant attempt at fiscal reform within the Bahmani kingdom. This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of administrative management within the context of a medieval empire.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Bahmani kingdom's disintegration was a direct consequence of intense factionalism among its nobility. The conflict between Deccanis and foreigners (afghans), fueled by power struggles and competition for resources, significantly weakened the kingdom's central authority. This internal strife created an environment conducive to the emergence of independent principalities, ultimately leading to the kingdom's dissolution. This highlights the internal vulnerabilities that can undermine even powerful empires.  The emergence of Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Bidar as independent states demonstrates the lasting impact of this internal fracturing.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Krishna Deva Raya, considered by some historians to be the greatest Vijayanagara ruler, successfully re-established internal order after a period of civil war and significantly expanded the empire's territories through military campaigns against Orissa and the Bahmani successor states.
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire's economic system heavily relied on a centralized system of land revenue collection, with uniform tax rates applied across all crops and regions, resulting in significant state wealth and widespread prosperity among the peasantry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Krishna Deva Raya's reign. He is widely acknowledged for consolidating the Vijayanagara Empire after a period of internal strife and for his successful military campaigns that expanded the empire's boundaries. His victories against Orissa, reclaiming territories up to the Krishna River, and his triumphs over Bijapur, showcase his military prowess and strategic acumen.  This underscores the importance of strong leadership in consolidating and expanding an empire's power.

Statement 2, however, is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire possessed a robust economic system, it was not based on a completely centralized and uniform land revenue collection.  Tax rates varied depending on the type of crop, soil quality, and irrigation methods. The empire also featured a decentralized element with considerable autonomy granted to provincial governors (nayaks) who collected revenue within their respective territories.  The statement oversimplifies the complex economic structure of the empire and fails to account for the variations in revenue collection practices across different regions. The presence of nayaks and palegars also indicates a degree of decentralization in the revenue system, contrary to the statement's assertion of complete centralization.


**3. With reference to the political landscape of South India during the 15th and 16th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's decline was solely attributed to the Battle of Talikota (1565), which resulted in the sacking of the capital and the subsequent disintegration of the empire into smaller kingdoms.
2. The Bahmani Kingdom, prior to its fragmentation, significantly expanded its territory under Mahmud Gawan's leadership, extending its influence over western coastal areas including Goa and Dabhol, and engaging in conflicts with Vijayanagara and other kingdoms in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 presents an oversimplified view of the Vijayanagara Empire's decline. While the Battle of Talikota was a devastating blow, the empire's weakening was a gradual process spanning several decades.  Internal conflicts, succession struggles, and the rise of powerful feudatories contributed significantly to its decline. Attributing the decline solely to one battle ignores the complex interplay of internal and external factors that led to its downfall.  This highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of historical processes, avoiding simplistic causal explanations.

Statement 2 is accurate. Mahmud Gawan's leadership period marks a high point in the Bahmani Kingdom's expansion. His military campaigns successfully extended Bahmani control over crucial western coastal areas, including Goa and Dabhol. These acquisitions significantly enhanced the kingdom's trade and strategic position.  The conflicts with Vijayanagara, stemming from competition for resources and territory, further illustrates the complex power dynamics of the Deccan region during this period.  This underscores the importance of understanding the strategic motivations behind territorial expansion in the medieval period.


**4. With reference to the early phases of the Turkish conquest of North India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ghurid conquest, culminating in the Second Battle of Tarain (1192), marked the beginning of the widespread establishment of Turkish rule in North India, swiftly leading to the annexation of the entire Gangetic plain and the complete subjugation of all Rajput kingdoms.
2.  Prior to the Ghurid conquests, the Ghaznavids primarily engaged in plundering raids into the Gangetic valley and Rajputana, while Muslim traders and Sufi preachers gradually established a presence in North India, fostering some level of interaction between Islamic and Hindu societies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is inaccurate. While the Second Battle of Tarain was a pivotal moment in the Turkish conquest, it did not immediately lead to the complete annexation of the Gangetic plain or the total subjugation of all Rajput kingdoms.  The process of Turkish expansion was protracted, involving numerous battles and rebellions over several decades.  Rajput resistance continued even after the Ghurid victories, and the establishment of stable Turkish rule in various parts of North India was a gradual process. This highlights the complexities of imperial expansion and the resilience of local resistance.

Statement 2 correctly describes the earlier phase of Turkish presence in North India. The Ghaznavids initially focused on plundering raids, but alongside this, Muslim traders and Sufi preachers were establishing a presence, initiating a gradual process of cultural and religious interaction between the two communities.  This demonstrates the multifaceted nature of early interactions between the conquering forces and the existing Indian population. The coexistence of raiding and peaceful interactions underscores the complexities of early interactions between different cultures and religions.


**5. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reign of Razia Sultana (1236-1240) was characterized by her successful efforts to maintain the power of the monarchy against the powerful Turkish nobles (chahalgani), culminating in her complete victory and the consolidation of royal authority.
2.  Balban (1266-1287), known for his strong centralized rule, effectively suppressed rebellions in Bengal and Bihar, establishing a firm control over these eastern regions and successfully integrating them into the Delhi Sultanate's administrative structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Razia Sultana's reign, while notable for her attempt to challenge the power of the Turkish nobles, did not result in a complete victory or consolidation of royal authority.  Her rule was marked by continuous rebellions and ultimately ended with her assassination.  Her struggle against the powerful Turkish chiefs highlights the ongoing tension between the monarchy and the nobility within the Delhi Sultanate.  This illustrates the challenges faced by even strong rulers in navigating the complex power dynamics of a medieval state.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While Balban did implement strong centralized policies, he did not completely suppress rebellions in Bengal and Bihar.  These regions remained a source of challenge to the Delhi Sultanate's authority throughout his reign and beyond.  The recurring rebellions in these eastern regions demonstrate the difficulties in maintaining control over distant provinces within a vast empire.  This highlights the limitations of centralized control in a geographically dispersed medieval empire.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom's administration under Mahmud Gawan, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud Gawan implemented a system dividing the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each governed by a tarafdar, with fixed salaries and obligations for nobles maintaining cavalry contingents.  The salary could be paid in cash or through jagirs.
2.  A significant portion of land in each province (khalisa) was reserved for the Sultan's expenses, and efforts were made towards land measurement and fixing cultivator tax payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms within the Bahmani Kingdom.  Statement 1 correctly describes his division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs), each under a tarafdar, a system designed to improve efficiency and control.  The detail about salary payment options (cash or jagir) further underscores the nuanced nature of his administrative approach. Statement 2 accurately highlights the allocation of khalisa land for the Sultan's expenses, a common practice in medieval kingdoms to ensure royal revenue, and the efforts towards land measurement and tax fixation, which aimed to improve revenue collection and reduce exploitation.  Therefore, both statements are historically accurate representations of Mahmud Gawan's administrative reforms.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Vijayanagara Empire's disintegration:**

1.  The death of Deva Raya II triggered a series of civil wars and the weakening of central authority, leading to the rise of powerful ministers who extracted heavy taxes, causing widespread distress.
2.  The Tuluva dynasty, founded by Krishna Deva Raya, marked a period of renewed strength and stability, restoring internal order and reclaiming lost territories from Orissa and the successor states of the Bahmani kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements reflect key aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire's decline and subsequent resurgence. Statement 1 accurately depicts the chaos that followed Deva Raya II's death.  The lack of a clear succession led to internal conflicts, empowering ministers who exploited the populace. This internal weakness significantly contributed to the empire's vulnerability. Statement 2 correctly describes Krishna Deva Raya's pivotal role in reviving the empire. He established the Tuluva dynasty, effectively ending the period of internal strife. His military campaigns successfully restored territories lost to Orissa and the Bahmani successor states, temporarily restoring Vijayanagara's dominance.  Therefore, the conjunction of internal strife and Krishna Deva Raya's subsequent restoration of order makes both statements correct.


**3. With reference to the Mughal administrative system under Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1.  The annexation of Bijapur and Golconda led to a shortage of easily manageable jagirs, with Aurangzeb retaining the best for the khalsa, resulting in a lack of takers for jagirs in newly conquered, unsettled areas.
2.  To conserve resources, Aurangzeb implemented a virtual ban on new recruitment, leading to widespread discontent among the sons and sons-in-law of old nobles awaiting mansabs and jagirs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the challenges Aurangzeb faced in managing the Mughal administrative system, particularly concerning the jagir system. Statement 1 correctly identifies the problem of jagir scarcity following the conquests of Bijapur and Golconda.  Aurangzeb's policy of retaining prime jagirs for the khalsa (royal treasury) directly contributed to this shortage, especially in newly acquired and unstable territories of the Deccan.  This created significant difficulties in rewarding loyal nobles and maintaining the efficiency of the system. Statement 2 correctly points out Aurangzeb's policy of restricting new recruitment to conserve resources.  This decision, while fiscally prudent, caused significant resentment among aspiring nobles, especially those from established families who expected promotions and jagirs.  The combination of jagir scarcity and the recruitment freeze created considerable instability within the nobility, contributing to the weakening of the Mughal Empire.



**4. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's policy of matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers, notably the Kachhawas of Amber, was primarily aimed at securing military alliances and consolidating his power, with religious tolerance playing a secondary role.
2.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax in 1564 and his policy of religious tolerance were integral parts of his Rajput policy, aimed at fostering goodwill and integrating Hindu elites into the Mughal administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While matrimonial alliances were a part of Akbar's strategy, Statement 1 oversimplifies the motivations.  While military alliances were a benefit, Akbar's Rajput policy was significantly shaped by his broader goals of religious harmony and the integration of powerful Hindu elites into the Mughal administration.  The matrimonial alliances were a tool to achieve this larger objective, not the sole purpose. Statement 2 accurately captures the significance of Akbar's religious policies within his Rajput strategy.  The abolition of the jizya tax was a powerful symbolic gesture, demonstrating Akbar's commitment to religious tolerance. This, along with his generally tolerant approach, was crucial in gaining the trust and cooperation of the Rajput rulers, thereby strengthening his political base.  Therefore, Statement 2 provides a more accurate and nuanced understanding of Akbar's Rajput policy.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Deccan states in the 17th century:**

1.  The treaties of 1636 between Shah Jahan and the Deccan states of Bijapur and Golconda established Mughal suzerainty over the entire Deccan, leading to a period of relative peace and cultural flourishing.
2.  The rapid expansion of Bijapur and Golconda into Karnataka after 1636, while initially leading to prosperity, ultimately weakened their internal cohesion, creating opportunities for ambitious nobles like Shahji Bhonsle and Mir Jumla to challenge the established order.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe significant developments in 17th-century Deccan politics. Statement 1 correctly notes the outcome of the 1636 treaties. Shah Jahan's diplomatic efforts successfully established Mughal suzerainty over Bijapur and Golconda, leading to a period of peace in the region. This period also witnessed a flourishing of culture in the Deccan states.  The treaties, however, did not represent complete Mughal control but rather a complex power-sharing arrangement. Statement 2 accurately highlights the consequences of the Deccan states' expansion. The rapid territorial gains in Karnataka, while initially boosting their power and prosperity, created internal instability. This facilitated the rise of ambitious nobles who sought to carve out independent power bases, ultimately undermining the stability of Bijapur and Golconda.  The combination of initial success followed by internal fracturing makes both statements a correct assessment of the period.



**6. With reference to the Mughal army in the first half of the 17th century, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mughal army under Shah Jahan consisted primarily of cavalry provided by mansabdars, supplemented by a corps of ahadis (gentlemen-troopers) who performed diverse duties, including military and administrative roles.
2. While the Mughal cavalry remained a formidable force, the infantry was poorly organized, lacked discipline, and was considered inferior to contemporary European infantry, which had advanced with the development of flintlock muskets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements reflect the composition and strengths/weaknesses of the Mughal army during Shah Jahan's reign. Statement 1 accurately describes the core of the Mughal military. Mansabdars supplied the bulk of the cavalry, a traditional strength of the Mughal army. Ahadis, a distinct corps of gentlemen-troopers, played a crucial role, combining military service with administrative and other duties. Their versatility and loyalty made them a valuable asset. Statement 2 correctly points out the contrast between the effective Mughal cavalry and the less developed infantry. While the cavalry remained a potent force, the Mughal infantry suffered from poor organization and discipline.  This was a significant weakness compared to contemporary European armies that had modernized their infantry with flintlock muskets.  This disparity would have significant implications in later conflicts.  The combination of a strong cavalry and a weaker infantry makes both statements a correct description of the Mughal military.


**7. With reference to Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system, based on accurate land measurement and a fixed crop rate (ray), aimed at ensuring a fair assessment of land revenue, with the state's share fixed at one-third of the produce. Peasants had the option to pay in cash or kind.
2. Sher Shah Suri's emphasis on improving trade and commerce included the restoration of the Grand Trunk Road, the construction of numerous sarais (inns) along major routes, and the standardization of weights and measures to facilitate trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly reflect crucial aspects of Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms. Statement 1 accurately describes his land revenue system.  It emphasized accurate land measurement to prevent arbitrary assessments, a significant improvement over previous systems. The fixed crop rate (ray) and the option of payment in cash or kind aimed at fairness and efficiency.  The one-third share for the state was a relatively moderate rate compared to some earlier practices. Statement 2 correctly highlights Sher Shah Suri's efforts to boost trade and commerce. The restoration of the Grand Trunk Road and the construction of numerous sarais along major trade routes were essential for improving infrastructure and facilitating the movement of goods and people. The standardization of weights and measures further streamlined trade and reduced disputes.  The combination of improved land revenue collection and efficient trade infrastructure makes both statements a fair representation of Sher Shah Suri's reforms.


**8. Consider the following statements about the early Mughal period:**

1. Babur's victory at the Battle of Panipat (1526) marked the beginning of Mughal rule in India, though consolidating his power required further battles against Rana Sanga at Khanwa and other opponents.
2.  The Battle of Khanwa (1527) was a crucial victory for Babur, securing his control over Agra and the surrounding area, but the Mughal conquest of India was far from complete, requiring years of further campaigns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly reflect the early phase of Mughal expansion in India under Babur. Statement 1 accurately describes the significance of the Battle of Panipat.  It marked the beginning of Mughal dominance in the Indo-Gangetic plains but did not represent a complete conquest of India.  Further battles, such as Khanwa against Rana Sanga, were necessary to consolidate Mughal power and secure their hold on key territories. Statement 2 correctly highlights the importance of the Battle of Khanwa. It was a decisive victory for Babur, securing his control over Agra and solidifying his position in the region. However, it did not end the struggle for power.  Years of continued campaigns were needed to fully establish Mughal authority across India. The combination of the initial victory at Panipat followed by the crucial victory at Khanwa makes both statements a correct interpretation of the early Mughal period.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a thorough understanding of the subject matter.


**1. With reference to Akbar's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's daily routine involved a public appearance at the jharoka, followed by an open darbar (diwan-i-am) lasting until midday, where petitions were addressed.
2.  Confidential consultations with ministers typically occurred in a chamber near Akbar's bathing apartment, eventually known as the ghusal khana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's administrative system.  The jharoka darshan, a daily public appearance, allowed Akbar to connect with his subjects and receive petitions directly. This fostered a sense of accessibility and direct communication with the ruler. The open darbar, or diwan-i-am, was a formal court session where important matters of state were discussed and decisions were made.  This public nature of the darbar further emphasized Akbar's commitment to transparency and engagement with his people.

Statement 2 correctly describes the location of private consultations with ministers.  The proximity of the consultation chamber to the ghusal khana (bathing apartment) is historically accurate and reflects the informal yet important nature of these private meetings. The evolution of the term "ghusal khana" to denote this private consultation chamber is also a historically accurate detail.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they fail to capture the accuracy of both statements.


**2. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bhara Mal of Amber, was solely driven by strategic political considerations, without any regard for personal affection or religious tolerance.
2.  Akbar's policy towards the Rajputs involved a combination of matrimonial alliances and granting high ranks to Rajput nobles like Bhagwant Das and Man Singh, regardless of whether matrimonial alliances were established.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the marriage to Harkha Bai had strategic political benefits, solidifying Akbar's alliance with Amber, it's inaccurate to suggest that personal affection and religious tolerance played no role. Akbar's policy towards his Hindu wives demonstrated religious tolerance, which contributed to the success of his Rajput policy.  The text explicitly mentions Akbar granting complete religious freedom to his Hindu wives and according honored positions to their families.

Statement 2 accurately reflects Akbar's nuanced Rajput policy. He used matrimonial alliances strategically but didn't make them a prerequisite for forging alliances.  The elevation of Bhagwant Das and Man Singh to high ranks, alongside Akbar's fostering of a relationship with the Kachhawaha clan, demonstrates a broader strategy that went beyond marriage alone.  The example of the Hadas of Ranthambhor, who remained in Akbar's favor without matrimonial ties, further supports this.


**3. With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax and pilgrim tax was primarily motivated by his personal conversion to a syncretic faith, abandoning traditional Islamic orthodoxy.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, initially intended for discussions among Muslim theologians, was later opened to representatives of various faiths, leading to debates on religious and philosophical topics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar did evolve in his religious views and became less orthodox, it's inaccurate to say his abolition of the jizya and pilgrim taxes was solely due to a conversion to a syncretic faith. The text suggests these actions were part of a broader policy of religious tolerance and aimed at promoting social harmony and unity within the empire.  His motivations were complex and involved political pragmatism along with a genuine interest in religious and philosophical discussions.

Statement 2 accurately describes the evolution of the Ibadat Khana.  Initially a space for discussions among Muslim scholars, Akbar expanded its scope to include representatives from other faiths. This demonstrates his open-mindedness and his pursuit of understanding different religious perspectives. The debates that ensued, though sometimes disorderly, highlight Akbar's intellectual curiosity and his search for truth.


**4.  With reference to the Mughal nobility under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  The proportion of Hindus in the Mughal nobility under Akbar remained consistently low throughout his reign, never exceeding 10%.
2.  Raja Man Singh and Raja Birbal were significant Rajput figures who held positions of influence and enjoyed close personal relationships with Akbar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage mentions that in 1594, Hindus comprised about 16% of the nobility.  This figure alone refutes the claim of consistently low representation below 10%. The proportion of Hindus in the nobility fluctuated over time and increased during Akbar's reign, showcasing the emperor's policy of incorporating Hindus into positions of power and influence.

Statement 2 is correct.  Raja Man Singh and Raja Birbal are explicitly mentioned in the text as being close personal friends and advisors of Akbar.  Their prominent positions within the Mughal nobility underscore Akbar's policy of integrating capable individuals from various backgrounds into his administration.


**5.  Consider the following statements regarding the Mughal administrative structure:**

1.  The twelve subas created by Akbar in 1580 included Bengal, Bihar, Allahabad, Awadh, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Multan, Kabul, Aimer, Malwa, and Gujarat, each governed by a subedar.
2.  The Mughal provincial administration under Akbar lacked a system of checks and balances, relying primarily on the authority of the subedar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately lists the twelve subas established by Akbar in 1580 and the role of the subedar as governor. This division formed the backbone of Akbar's efficient provincial administration. The inclusion of diverse regions reflects Akbar's efforts to consolidate and govern his vast empire effectively.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Akbar's provincial administration did incorporate a system of checks and balances.  The text explicitly mentions the appointment of a diwan (finance minister), bakhshi (military paymaster), sadr (religious judge), qazi (judicial officer), and waqi'a-navis (recorder of events) to each province.  This distribution of responsibilities aimed to prevent any single official from accumulating excessive power and to ensure accountability and efficiency.


**6. With reference to the Battle of Haldighati, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Battle of Haldighati was primarily a conflict between Hindu and Muslim forces, with Rana Pratap leading the Hindu armies against Akbar's Muslim forces.
2.  Rana Pratap's army at Haldighati included a significant Afghan contingent led by Hakim Khan Sur, alongside Rajput forces and Bhil auxiliaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the conflict involved Rana Pratap and the Mughal forces, it is inaccurate to frame it solely as a Hindu-Muslim conflict.  The text explicitly states that Rana Pratap's army included an Afghan contingent, highlighting the complex composition of the opposing forces and negating a simple religious categorization of the conflict.  The battle's context was more about Rajput resistance to Mughal expansion than a purely religious war.

Statement 2 accurately describes the composition of Rana Pratap's army. The inclusion of the Afghan contingent led by Hakim Khan Sur, along with Rajput and Bhil troops, demonstrates the diverse nature of the alliance assembled by Rana Pratap, representing a coalition of forces rather than a single monolithic entity.


**7. With reference to the Mughal Mansabdari system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The mansab system under Akbar initially consisted of a single rank, later evolving into a dual system of *zar* and *sawar* ranks to indicate personal status and the number of cavalrymen to be maintained, respectively.
2.  The *dagh* system, a crucial component of the mansabdari system, involved branding horses with imperial marks to ensure the quality and authenticity of the cavalry contingents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Mughal mansabdari system. The evolution from a single rank to the dual *zar* and *sawar* system is historically accurate and reflects Akbar's efforts to refine and systematize his military organization.  The *zar* rank signified the officer's personal status and determined his salary, while the *sawar* rank indicated the number of cavalrymen he was responsible for maintaining.

The *dagh* system, as described in statement 2, is also a historically accurate component of the mansabdari system. This system of branding horses ensured that the cavalry contingents were well-equipped and maintained a certain standard of quality.  Periodic inspections further reinforced this system's effectiveness.


**8. With reference to the Zabti system of land revenue, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Zabti system, introduced by Akbar, involved a fixed division of the agricultural produce between the peasant and the state, with no provision for adjustments based on crop yield or market prices.
2.  Akbar's land revenue system incorporated elements such as the *dahsala* system, which calculated average produce and prices over ten years to determine the state's share, and the *batai* system, where the state's share was a fixed proportion of the harvest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Zabti system was not a rigid system with a fixed division of produce.  It considered local prices and productivity, and allowed for adjustments based on variations in crop yield. The *dahsala* system, a key component of the Zabti system, is evidence of this flexibility.  The system aimed to be fair and efficient, while ensuring a stable revenue stream for the state.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's land revenue system was not monolithic. It incorporated different methods of assessment, including the *dahsala* system, which calculated average produce and prices over a decade, and the *batai* system, which involved a fixed proportion of the harvest.  This flexibility allowed for adaptation to local conditions and ensured that the system remained adaptable to changing circumstances.  The availability of options like *rasag*, a rough estimate based on past dues, further illustrates the system's adaptability.


**9. With reference to the economic and social life under the Mughals, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal nobility, despite receiving high salaries, often incurred significant expenses on maintaining large households, stables, and extravagant lifestyles, often leading to debt.
2.  The Mughal nobility played a negligible role in economic development, primarily focused on land ownership and avoiding commercial activities due to religious restrictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the lifestyle and financial realities of the Mughal nobility.  The text highlights the high expenses associated with maintaining large households, stables, and an opulent lifestyle.  Despite their high salaries, many nobles faced financial difficulties, indicating that their spending often outpaced their income.  This is a significant aspect of their socio-economic reality.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Mughal nobility was not entirely detached from commercial activities.  The text indicates that many nobles invested in land, developed orchards and markets, lent money, and even participated directly or indirectly in trade.  While land ownership was their primary source of income, their involvement in commercial ventures demonstrates their contribution to economic development. Abul Fazl's advice to nobles to engage in commercial speculation further supports this.


**10. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The crisis in the jagirdari system, characterized by a shortage of jagirs, corruption, and reduced cavalry contingents, significantly weakened the Mughal military and administrative capabilities.
2.  The decline of the Mughal Empire was primarily due to the cessation of immigration from Central Asia, leading to a lack of talented administrators and soldiers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies a major factor contributing to the Mughal decline. The text details the crisis within the jagirdari system, including jagir shortages, corruption, and the reduction of cavalry contingents.  These issues severely hampered the empire's military strength and administrative efficiency, contributing to its weakening.  The inability to effectively collect revenue and maintain a strong army played a crucial role.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the cessation of large-scale immigration from Central Asia might have had some impact, it's inaccurate to attribute the decline solely to this factor. By Aurangzeb's reign, the Mughal nobility largely consisted of those born in India.  The text emphasizes that the decline resulted from internal factors such as the crisis in the jagirdari system, Aurangzeb's flawed policies, and the rise of challenges like the Maratha empire.  The argument that the decline was due to a lack of Central Asian immigrants is a simplistic and historically inaccurate interpretation.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's prior knowledge.


**1. With reference to Akbar's administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's subas were primarily defined by geographical boundaries, ensuring uniformity in administration across the empire.
2.  The appointment of a diverse set of officials – subedar, diwan, bakhshi, sadr, qazi, and waqia-navis – within each suba aimed to establish a system of checks and balances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar's 12 subas (Bengal, Bihar, Allahabad, Awadh, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Multan, Kabul, Ajmer, Malwa, and Gujarat) aimed for administrative efficiency, their boundaries weren't purely geographical.  They were often shaped by pre-existing political and economic realities, leading to variations in size and administrative challenges.  The focus was on strategic control and revenue collection rather than strict geographical uniformity.

Statement 2 is correct.  The appointment of a subedar (governor), diwan (finance minister), bakhshi (military paymaster), sadr (religious judge), qazi (judicial officer), and waqia-navis (news reporter) in each province was a key aspect of Akbar's administrative structure.  This system aimed to prevent the concentration of power in a single individual and promote accountability through checks and balances.  The different officials had overlapping jurisdictions, requiring them to collaborate and prevent arbitrary actions.  This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of administrative management.


**2. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers were primarily driven by a desire to consolidate his power base and establish political control over Rajputana.
2.  Akbar's policy of religious tolerance extended beyond matrimonial alliances, as evidenced by his abolition of the jizya tax and the pilgrim tax.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Akbar's marriages to Rajput princesses were partly motivated by personal preference and cultural exchange, they significantly served his political strategy.  These alliances fostered loyalty among powerful Rajput clans, weakening potential opposition and integrating them into the Mughal administration. The elevation of Rajput families to high ranks within the Mughal nobility further solidified this political integration.

Statement 2 is also correct. Akbar's religious policy was a cornerstone of his reign.  The abolition of the jizya tax (a tax on non-Muslims) and the pilgrim tax demonstrated a commitment to religious tolerance and aimed to foster a sense of unity within his diverse empire. This policy went beyond the strategic gains from Rajput alliances, showcasing Akbar's broader vision of a unified and equitable state.  This aspect highlights his understanding of social cohesion and political pragmatism.


**3. With reference to the Mughal Empire's relations with Central Asian powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's campaigns in the Northwest were primarily aimed at securing the frontier against the Uzbeks and establishing a defensible border along the Hindu Kush.
2.  The dispute over Qandhar between the Mughals and the Safavids was primarily a matter of strategic importance, with economic and prestige considerations playing a secondary role.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's expansion into Kashmir, Baluchistan, and the securing of the Khyber Pass were vital steps in establishing a firm northwestern frontier. The Uzbek threat was a constant concern, and controlling these areas served as a crucial buffer against potential invasion.  This demonstrates Akbar's strategic military acumen and foresight in securing his empire's borders.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the strategic importance of Qandhar was undeniable, its economic and prestige value were equally significant factors in the dispute between the Mughals and the Safavids.  Qandhar controlled vital trade routes and served as a symbol of power and influence in the region.  The conflict wasn't solely about military strategy; it also involved control over resources and the assertion of dominance in Central Asia.  This highlights the complex interplay of political, economic, and symbolic factors in Mughal foreign policy.


**4. With reference to the Deccan Sultanates, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Deccan Sultanates' policy of integrating Maratha chiefs into their armies and administrations predated Akbar's Rajput policy.
2.  The cultural contributions of the Deccan Sultanates included significant advancements in Urdu literature, architecture (such as the Charminar and Gol Gumbaz), and painting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Deccan Sultanates, notably Bijapur and Ahmadnagar, actively employed Maratha soldiers and administrators long before Akbar implemented his Rajput policy. This was a strategic move to integrate local power structures and create a more stable military and administrative base.  This demonstrates a parallel approach to integrating local elites into the ruling structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Deccan Sultanates fostered a rich cultural environment.  The development of Dakhini Urdu, a unique dialect of Urdu, flourished under their patronage.  Architectural marvels like the Charminar in Hyderabad and the Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur stand as testaments to their artistic achievements.  Painting also thrived, reflecting a blend of Persian and Indian styles. This highlights the syncretic nature of the Deccan culture and its lasting impact on Indian art and literature.


**5. With reference to the reigns of Jahangir and Shah Jahan, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jahangir's reign witnessed the complete pacification of Bengal, ending the long-standing conflicts with Afghan chiefs and solidifying Mughal control in the region.
2. Shah Jahan's Balkh campaign, while initially successful, ultimately failed to achieve its objective of establishing a friendly ruler in Bokhara, due to Prince Murad's impetuous actions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Under Jahangir, the Mughal conquest and subsequent pacification of Bengal was largely successful, ending major conflicts with Afghan rebels and establishing lasting Mughal authority. Islam Khan's effective strategies and subsequent conciliatory policies played a crucial role in this achievement.  This demonstrates a successful blend of military action and political shrewdness.

Statement 2 is also correct. Shah Jahan's Balkh campaign, though initially successful in capturing Balkh, was ultimately hampered by Prince Murad's rash actions.  Murad's impetuous behaviour alienated Nazr Muhammad, the ruler of Balkh, leading to his flight and the failure to establish a stable and friendly regime in Bokhara. This showcases the impact of individual decisions on larger strategic goals and highlights the complexities of imperial expansion.


**6. With reference to the Mughal Mansabdari System, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mansabdari system, while initially designed to create a meritocratic system, gradually evolved into a system based primarily on hereditary succession.
2.  The Zāt and Sawār ranks within the Mansabdari system determined the social status and the number of cavalry a Mansabdar was obligated to maintain, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While hereditary succession played a role in the Mughal Mansabdari system, merit still played a significant role in appointments and promotions.  The system aimed to create a balance between hereditary privileges and demonstrated competence.  Competence and loyalty remained important considerations throughout the system's existence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Zāt (personal rank) and Sawār (cavalry rank) were crucial components of the Mansabdari system.  The Zāt indicated the social standing of a Mansabdar, while the Sawār rank determined the number of cavalrymen (and horses) he was responsible for maintaining. This system was designed to ensure the maintenance of a well-equipped cavalry force and establish a hierarchy within the Mughal nobility.


**7. With reference to Sher Shah Suri's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's architectural achievements, exemplified by his tomb at Sasaram, represent a synthesis of pre-existing architectural styles and a precursor to later Mughal styles.
2. Sher Shah Suri's policies were characterized by a high degree of religious tolerance, including the abolishment of the Jizya tax.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is a remarkable architectural achievement, blending elements from earlier styles and foreshadowing Mughal architectural trends.  Its design and construction showcase a sophisticated understanding of architecture and engineering, leaving a lasting impact on subsequent architectural styles.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Sher Shah Suri wasn't overtly bigoted, he did not abolish the Jizya tax.  His policies, while focused on administrative efficiency and economic reforms, did not extend to major religious reforms. The Jizya tax continued to be levied during his reign, indicating a focus on revenue generation rather than extensive religious tolerance.


**8. With reference to the early years of Akbar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's early consolidation of power involved conflicts with both the Afghan forces under Hemu and internal challenges from powerful nobles like Bairam Khan.
2. The suppression of the Uzbek rebellion in 1567 marked a significant turning point, allowing Akbar to focus on the expansion of his empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Akbar's ascension to the throne was followed by immediate challenges.  The defeat of Hemu at the Second Battle of Panipat was crucial, but the subsequent conflicts with ambitious nobles like Bairam Khan demonstrated the fragility of his early rule and the need to consolidate power. This highlights the internal and external challenges faced by a young emperor.

Statement 2 is also correct. The suppression of the protracted Uzbek rebellion in 1567 was a pivotal moment in Akbar's reign. It eliminated a major source of internal instability and allowed him to shift his focus towards territorial expansion and other policy initiatives. This marked a significant transition from consolidation to expansion.


**9. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The reign of Krishnadevaraya marked the zenith of the Vijayanagara Empire's military power and territorial expansion, although naval power remained relatively underdeveloped.
2. The Battle of Talikota (1565) is widely considered to mark the effective end of the Vijayanagara Empire, despite its continued existence for several decades thereafter.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign is indeed considered a high point for the Vijayanagara Empire.  His military victories against Bijapur and Orissa significantly expanded the empire's territory and consolidated its position as a major power in South India. However, the empire's naval capabilities remained comparatively weak compared to its military strength on land.  This highlights the strengths and limitations of the empire's military strategy.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Battle of Talikota (1565) was a devastating defeat for Vijayanagara, marking a turning point in its history.  Though the kingdom technically persisted for some time, the battle irrevocably shattered its power and influence, leading to its decline and fragmentation.  This demonstrates a pivotal moment in the history of South India.


**10. With reference to the cultural and economic aspects of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mughal nobility played a significant role in both the economic development and the patronage of arts and culture, despite their focus on land ownership and feudal practices.
2. The influx of foreign traders and skilled workers into the Mughal Empire during the 17th century led to significant technological advancements, particularly in the field of military technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mughal nobility, while largely feudal in nature, played a multifaceted role in the empire's economic and cultural spheres.  They invested in land development, engaged in trade, and extended patronage to artists, writers, and scholars. This demonstrates the complex relationship between feudalism and economic/cultural development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While there was an influx of foreign individuals into the Mughal Empire, particularly during the 17th century, this did not lead to significant technological advancements in military technology.  The Mughals did adopt some foreign military technologies, but their overall military technology remained relatively static compared to the advancements occurring in Europe.  This highlights the limitations of technology transfer and the relative isolation of Mughal India from European technological progress.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer, a detailed explanation, and analysis of distractors.

**1. With reference to Shivaji's coronation and its implications, consider the following statements:**

1. Shivaji's coronation at Raigarh signified his transition from a petty jagirdar to a ruler with a status equal to the Deccani sultans, thereby enhancing his standing among Maratha chiefs who previously viewed him as an upstart.
2.  The priest Gaga Bhatta's declaration of Shivaji's high-class Kshatriya status during the coronation solely aimed at strengthening his social position within the Maratha community and had no bearing on his diplomatic relations with other kingdoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Shivaji's coronation at Raigarh was a pivotal moment, elevating his status from a regional leader to an independent sovereign comparable to the Deccani sultans. This formal declaration significantly improved his standing among other Maratha chiefs who had previously been hesitant to accept his leadership. The coronation provided legitimacy and authority, solidifying his position and facilitating his interactions with other powers on an equal footing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gaga Bhatta's declaration of Shivaji's Kshatriya status did strengthen his social standing within the Maratha community, it also had significant diplomatic implications.  By establishing his Kshatriya status, Shivaji gained legitimacy as a ruler in the eyes of other Hindu kingdoms and potentially fostered alliances based on shared caste identity. This religious and social legitimacy facilitated his ability to negotiate treaties with the Deccani sultans on a footing of equality, a crucial aspect of his foreign policy.  The coronation ceremony was a multifaceted event with both internal and external political implications.


**2. With reference to Shivaji's administrative system, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shivaji's Ashtapradhan, while comprising eight ministers, functioned as a cohesive council of ministers, ensuring collective decision-making and checks and balances within the administration.
2. Shivaji's revenue system, modeled after Malik Ambar's system, involved complete abolition of the zamindari (deshmukhi) system and a complete reliance on a direct revenue collection system from mirasdars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Shivaji did establish an Ashtapradhan, it was not a council of ministers in the traditional sense. Each minister was directly responsible to Shivaji, not to the council as a whole.  There was no system of collective decision-making or inherent checks and balances within the Ashtapradhan itself.  The system was more of a centralized, hierarchical structure with each minister managing their specific portfolio.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Shivaji's revenue system, while influenced by Malik Ambar's, did not involve the complete abolition of the zamindari (deshmukhi) system.  He did, however, exert stricter control over mirasdars (those with hereditary land rights) and deshmukhs, curbing their power and ensuring a larger share of revenue for the state. He maintained a system of jagirs (mmokasa) for his officials as well, indicating a nuanced approach rather than a complete overhaul of the existing system.  The assessment completed under Annaji Datto aimed at improving revenue collection but didn't eliminate the existing land tenure systems completely.


**3. With reference to Aurangzeb's Deccan policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's initial Deccan policy, lasting until 1668, primarily focused on recovering territories from Bijapur that had been part of the Ahmadnagar state before its surrender in 1636.
2.  Aurangzeb's later Deccan policy involved pressurizing Bijapur and Golconda into a military alliance with the Mughals against the Marathas, a strategy that proved unsuccessful due to a lack of trust and the Mughals' own expansionist ambitions in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The first phase of Aurangzeb's Deccan policy, up to 1668, concentrated on reclaiming territories ceded to Bijapur from the former Ahmadnagar kingdom. This was driven by the desire to consolidate Mughal power in the Deccan and to reverse the territorial gains made by Bijapur. The earlier treaty of 1636, where Shah Jahan had given away territories to Bijapur, was seen as a weakness to be rectified.

Statement 2 is also correct. Aurangzeb's subsequent policy attempted to forge an alliance with Bijapur and Golconda against Shivaji and later Sambhaji. However, this strategy failed due to a lack of mutual trust between the Mughal Empire and the Deccani states.  The Mughals’ own expansionist ambitions and the inherent distrust between these powers prevented the formation of a lasting and effective alliance.  The Deccani states feared being completely absorbed by the Mughals, making a genuine partnership impossible.  This ultimately led Aurangzeb to abandon the alliance strategy and resort to direct conquest of Bijapur and Golconda.


**4. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's Rajput policy solely relied on matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers as a precondition for establishing political alliances and securing their submission to Mughal rule.
2.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax in 1564 was primarily aimed at appeasing the Rajput rulers and is not considered a significant step towards broader religious toleration within the Mughal Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar did utilize matrimonial alliances strategically, it was not the sole precondition for establishing political alliances with Rajput rulers. He also incorporated Rajput rulers into his administration and granted them high mansabs (ranks) regardless of marital ties.  His approach was multifaceted, employing both diplomatic and military strategies to achieve his goals.  The Hadas of Ranthambhor, for instance, remained in his favor without matrimonial alliances.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax was a significant step toward broader religious toleration, not merely an appeasement tactic for Rajput rulers. The jizya was a poll tax on non-Muslims, and its removal demonstrated Akbar's commitment to religious neutrality and equality among his subjects, regardless of their faith. This policy was a crucial aspect of his broader strategy to consolidate his rule by fostering harmony between different religious communities within his vast empire, thereby strengthening his political base and promoting a sense of unity.


**5. With reference to the economic conditions during Aurangzeb's reign and the subsequent decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  While agricultural production increased steadily during Aurangzeb’s reign, the rapidly expanding demands and expectations of the ruling classes, coupled with rising prices, led to increased pressure on peasants and zamindars.
2.  The decline of the Mughal Empire was primarily a consequence of Aurangzeb’s flawed policies, particularly his religious policies, and not significantly influenced by the socio-economic factors prevailing at the time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Agricultural production did increase during Aurangzeb's reign, but the growth rate was insufficient to meet the escalating demands of a rapidly expanding nobility.  The increase in the number of mansabdars, coupled with rising prices and heavy land revenue, placed tremendous pressure on the peasantry and zamindars.  This created widespread discontent and contributed to the weakening of the Mughal Empire's economic foundation.  The existing systems were unable to sustain the growing demands.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Aurangzeb's policies, particularly his religious policies, exacerbated existing tensions and contributed to the decline, the downfall of the Mughal Empire was not solely attributable to his actions.  Underlying socio-economic factors, such as stagnant agricultural productivity relative to growing demands, the crisis of the jagirdari system, and internal contradictions within rural society, played a significant role in the empire's weakening and eventual disintegration.  These factors created a fertile ground for rebellion and instability, which Aurangzeb's policies only served to worsen.  The decline was a complex process with multiple contributing factors.


**1. With reference to Akbar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's conquest of Sindh in 1590 facilitated trade along the Indus River, benefiting Punjab.
2. Raja Man Singh, while serving as the Mughal governor of Bengal, conquered Orissa, Cooch-Bihar, and parts of East Bengal, including Dacca.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that Akbar's conquest of Sindh in 1590 opened up trade routes down the Indus River, directly benefiting Punjab. This demonstrates Akbar's strategic understanding of economic implications of territorial expansion and his ability to integrate newly acquired regions into the existing economic network of the empire.  This aspect highlights the interconnectedness of military conquests and economic policies during the Mughal era.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text clearly mentions Raja Man Singh's conquests in the east.  He successfully brought Orissa under Mughal control, expanding the empire's reach significantly. His further conquests of Cooch-Bihar and parts of East Bengal, including Dacca, showcase his military prowess and administrative capabilities.  This expansion solidified Mughal dominance in eastern India and demonstrates the effective implementation of Akbar's expansionist policies through capable governors. The inclusion of Dacca is crucial, highlighting the extent of Man Singh's achievements and the breadth of Akbar's control.  These details provide insights into the effective governance and expansionist strategies employed by Akbar.


**2. With reference to Akbar's religious policies, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar abolished the jizya tax, a poll tax levied on non-Muslims, to promote religious equality.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, initially a hall for Muslim theologians, was later opened to people of all faiths, reflecting Akbar's growing interest in religious pluralism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The passage explicitly mentions Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax, emphasizing his aim to establish an empire based on equal rights for all citizens regardless of their religious beliefs. This demonstrates Akbar's pragmatic approach to governance, recognizing the importance of religious harmony for the stability and prosperity of his vast empire. The abolition of this discriminatory tax was a significant step towards fostering religious tolerance and promoting social cohesion.  This act also reflects a shift away from strictly orthodox Islamic practices within the Mughal administration.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text details the establishment of the Ibadat Khana, initially restricted to Muslim theologians, and its subsequent opening to representatives of all religions. This transformation reflects Akbar's evolving understanding of religious diversity and his pursuit of a more inclusive approach to religious discourse and understanding.  The inclusion of Christians, Zoroastrians, Hindus, Jains, and even atheists in these discussions showcases his unprecedented open-mindedness and his genuine desire to engage with diverse religious perspectives. The Ibadat Khana thus became a unique space for intellectual exchange and a testament to Akbar's commitment to religious tolerance.


**3. With reference to Akbar's relations with the Rajputs, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's Rajput policy primarily involved matrimonial alliances as a precondition for Rajput acceptance of Mughal suzerainty.
2.  Despite the Rajput states' acceptance of Mughal suzerainty, Rana Pratap of Mewar remained steadfast in his resistance against the Mughals, employing guerrilla warfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Akbar did utilize matrimonial alliances to strengthen his relationships with Rajput rulers, it's inaccurate to say this was the *primary* precondition for their acceptance of Mughal suzerainty. The text highlights that Akbar also adopted a policy of broad religious toleration and granted high positions to Rajput nobles based on merit, irrespective of matrimonial alliances.  For instance, the Hadas of Ranthambhor remained in Akbar's favour without any matrimonial ties.  Therefore, Akbar's Rajput policy was multifaceted and not solely dependent on marital alliances.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly discusses Rana Pratap's unwavering resistance against Mughal rule even after other Rajput states accepted Mughal suzerainty.  His use of guerrilla warfare against the superior Mughal army demonstrates his determination and showcases Rajput valour.  The text emphasizes that despite his individual struggle, Rana Pratap's defiance had little effect on the overall acceptance of Mughal suzerainty by most other Rajput states. This highlights the complexities of Rajput politics and the varying responses to Mughal expansion.  The description of Rana Pratap's continued resistance, even after facing defeat at Haldighati, underscores his unwavering commitment to independence.


**4.  With reference to the administrative reforms of Akbar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar divided the empire into twelve subas (provinces) in 1580, each governed by a subedar, a diwan, a bakhshi, a sadr, a qazi, and a waqia-navis.
2. The system implemented in each province ensured a balance of power through checks and balances, extending orderly governance to the provinces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The provided text explicitly details Akbar's division of the empire into twelve subas in 1580. It further specifies the key administrative officials appointed in each province: the subedar (governor), diwan (finance minister), bakhshi (military paymaster), sadr (religious head), qazi (judge), and waqia-navis (chronicler). This administrative structure demonstrates Akbar's focus on efficient governance and control across his vast empire.  The detailed listing of officials provides insights into the complexity and sophistication of the Mughal administrative system.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text states that this administrative setup, with its multiple officials in each province, was based on the principle of checks and balances. This system ensured accountability and prevented any single official from accumulating excessive power.  By establishing this structure across all provinces, Akbar successfully extended orderly and efficient governance to the entire empire, laying the groundwork for long-term stability and effective administration. The emphasis on checks and balances showcases Akbar's administrative acumen and foresight in preventing corruption and promoting efficient governance.


**5. With reference to Akbar's foreign policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's expeditions against Kashmir and Baluchistan were primarily aimed at securing the northwestern frontier of the empire against Uzbek threats.
2.  Akbar's acquisition of Kandahar in 1595 concluded his efforts to establish a scientifically defensible northwestern frontier, securing the region from Uzbek incursions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text clearly explains that Akbar's campaigns into Kashmir and Baluchistan were strategically motivated to block potential invasion routes for the Uzbeks, a significant threat to the Mughal Empire's northwestern frontier. The mention of securing the Khyber Pass further underscores this objective.  This highlights Akbar's proactive approach to security and his understanding of the strategic importance of controlling key geographical locations. The marriage of a Baltistan chief's daughter to Salim (Jahangir) also indicates a policy of consolidating alliances in the region.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage explicitly states that Akbar's acquisition of Kandahar in 1595 was a crucial step in establishing a "scientific frontier" for the empire in the northwest. This acquisition, combined with the earlier consolidation efforts in the northwest, effectively created a strong defensive line against Uzbek incursions. This demonstrates Akbar's long-term strategic vision and his commitment to securing the empire's borders. The term "scientific frontier" itself implies a calculated and well-planned approach to border security, based on geographical and strategic considerations.  The mention of Akbar's prolonged stay in Lahore to monitor the situation further underscores the importance he placed on securing this frontier.


**6. With reference to Sher Shah Suri's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is considered a masterpiece of architecture, representing a culmination of earlier styles and a precursor to later architectural trends.
2. Sher Shah Suri's administrative reforms were notably inclusive, incorporating Hindus into positions of power within his administration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly describes Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram as a significant architectural achievement, marking a transition point in architectural styles. This architectural masterpiece reflects the high level of artistic and engineering skills during his reign and showcases the blend of different architectural influences. The description emphasizes its importance in the evolution of architectural styles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Sher Shah Suri is not described as a bigot,  the passage indicates that his nobility was almost exclusively drawn from Afghans.  Although he did not initiate overtly discriminatory policies, his administration lacked the inclusive nature of Akbar’s later rule, which actively incorporated Hindus into high offices.  The continuation of the jizya tax, while not necessarily overtly discriminatory, indicates a lack of the proactive inclusivity seen under Akbar. The mention of the treacherous murder of Puran Mal, despite a binding oath, also suggests a lack of consistent adherence to principles of fairness and inclusivity in his governance.


**7. With reference to the cultural developments during the 15th Century in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The reign of Alauddin Hussain Shah in Bengal saw a flourishing of Bengali literature and the promotion of high offices for Hindus.
2.  The Gajapati rulers of Orissa, known for their military prowess, extended their rule southwards towards Karnataka, leading to conflicts with Vijayanagara and the Bahmani Sultans.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly highlights Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign in Bengal as a period of significant literary growth in the Bengali language and a liberal policy that saw Hindus appointed to high governmental positions.  This showcases the interplay between political patronage and cultural flourishing, particularly the promotion of regional languages and the integration of Hindus in the administration.  The examples of Hindus holding key positions like wazir, chief physician, and head of the bodyguard illustrate the inclusive nature of Alauddin's rule.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage describes the Gajapati rulers of Orissa as powerful warriors who expanded their kingdom southwards towards Karnataka. This expansion inevitably led to conflicts with other powerful kingdoms in the region like Vijayanagara and the Bahmani Sultanate, illustrating the dynamic power struggles of the time.  The mention of their southward expansion highlights their ambition and military strength, while the conflicts with Vijayanagara and the Bahmani Sultanate illustrate the geopolitical landscape of 15th-century South India.  The inability to maintain these southern conquests for long periods, however, points to the limitations of their power despite their military successes.


**8. With reference to the Mughal Empire's relations with Central Asian powers, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's primary concern regarding Central Asian affairs stemmed from the threat posed by Abdullah Khan Uzbek to the Mughal Empire's northwestern frontier.
2. The dispute over Qandahar, claimed by both the Safavids and the Mughals, initially did not significantly affect relations between the two empires.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text emphasizes that Akbar's increasing involvement in Central Asian affairs was largely driven by the considerable threat posed by Abdullah Khan Uzbek to the Mughal Empire's northwestern territories.  The text details several military actions undertaken by Akbar to counter this threat, including expeditions to Kashmir and Baluchistan, and his prolonged stay in Lahore.  This highlights the strategic importance Akbar placed on securing the northwestern frontier and the significant impact of Central Asian politics on Mughal affairs.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explains that, in the initial stages, the dispute over Qandahar, a strategically and economically important region claimed by both the Safavids and the Mughals, did not severely damage the generally positive relations between the two empires.  This highlights the ability of both empires to manage their differences despite competing claims over crucial territories.  The exchange of embassies and gifts between the rulers of both empires further underscores the initially cordial nature of their relationship.  The later escalation of tensions over Qandahar, however, demonstrates the eventual limitations of maintaining amicable relations despite unresolved territorial disputes.


**9. With reference to the composition of the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1.  From Akbar's reign onwards, Hindus, particularly Rajputs, were increasingly incorporated into the Mughal nobility, significantly influencing its composition.
2.  Under Jahangir and Shah Jahan, the Mughal nobility achieved considerable stability, with established rules and regulations governing promotions and recruitment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage clearly indicates that the inclusion of Hindus, especially Rajputs, in the Mughal nobility became a regular practice from Akbar's reign onwards.  This integration not only altered the demographic composition of the nobility but also impacted its political dynamics.  The text mentions prominent Hindu figures like Raja Man Singh and Raja Birbal, highlighting their close relationships with Akbar and their significant influence within the empire. This reflects Akbar's policy of incorporating diverse elements into his administration and building a more inclusive ruling class.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text specifically notes that the Mughal nobility attained a considerable degree of stability under Jahangir and Shah Jahan.  This stability was facilitated by the implementation of formal rules and regulations governing promotions, discipline, and recruitment within the mansabdari system. This demonstrates a more structured and formalized approach to managing the nobility compared to the earlier periods, contributing to the overall stability of the empire.  The emphasis on orderly promotions and recruitment suggests a conscious effort by Jahangir and Shah Jahan to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the administrative system.


**10. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate's struggle against the Mongols, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delhi Sultanate's early struggles against the Mongols were significantly influenced by the internal divisions and weakness within the Sultanate itself.
2.  Alauddin Khalji's military reforms and strategic decisions allowed the Delhi Sultanate to successfully repel Mongol invasions and secure its northwestern frontier.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text highlights that the early conflicts against the Mongols exposed the internal weaknesses and disunity within the Delhi Sultanate.  The struggles over Lahore and Multan between Iltutmish and his rivals, and the defection of some Turkish nobles to the Mongols, clearly illustrate these internal divisions. The text emphasizes that the Sultanate was initially too feeble and disorganized to effectively resist the Mongols, highlighting the impact of internal strife on its ability to defend its borders.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The passage details how Alauddin Khalji's military reforms and strategic decisions played a crucial role in turning the tide against the Mongols.  His large, efficient army, strengthened fortifications, and proactive military responses were instrumental in repelling Mongol incursions and securing the Sultanate's northwestern frontier.  The text contrasts the earlier failures to repel Mongol attacks with Alauddin Khalji’s success, showcasing his military acumen and the effectiveness of his reforms.  The ability of the Delhi Sultanate to effectively resist the Mongols under Alauddin represents a significant shift from the earlier period of vulnerability.


**1. With reference to Sher Shah Suri's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram exemplifies a culmination of pre-existing architectural styles and a precursor to later developments.
2.  The Purana Qila in Delhi, including its mosque, is the sole surviving structure from a new city established by Sher Shah Suri on the Yamuna riverbank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is indeed considered a masterpiece of architecture, representing a synthesis of earlier styles while foreshadowing future architectural trends.  It's a significant landmark in the evolution of architectural design in India, showcasing a blend of pre-Mughal elements and innovative features that influenced subsequent constructions.  The architectural style is unique and stands as testament to his patronage of art and architecture.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Purana Qila (Old Fort) in Delhi, along with its notable mosque, is the only remaining part of a larger city that Sher Shah Suri constructed on the banks of the Yamuna River.  While much of his urban planning has been lost to time, this surviving complex provides valuable insights into his urban development strategies and architectural preferences. The mosque within the fort is a significant architectural accomplishment of its time, reflecting the architectural styles prevalent during his rule.  The other structures from his planned city are no longer extant.


**2. With reference to Akbar's early reign and consolidation of power, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's accession to the throne was immediately followed by a period of complete peace and stability across the Mughal empire.
2. Bairam Khan, Akbar's tutor and regent, played a crucial role in averting threats from Afghan forces, particularly Hemu, and expanding Mughal territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar's ascension was far from peaceful. He inherited a fractured empire still grappling with powerful Afghan resistance, notably under Hemu, who had even briefly captured Delhi.  Akbar’s early years were marked by significant challenges in consolidating his power and re-establishing control over the vast territories claimed by the Mughals. The Afghan forces were a major threat that needed to be dealt with effectively. Therefore, the statement that Akbar's accession was followed by complete peace and stability is not true.

Statement 2 is correct. Bairam Khan, a loyal and capable general, was instrumental in securing Akbar's rule.  He effectively neutralized the immediate threat posed by Hemu at the Second Battle of Panipat, a pivotal victory that secured Akbar's position.  Furthermore, Bairam Khan's regency saw the expansion of Mughal territories eastward to Jaunpur and westward to Ajmer, laying a strong foundation for Akbar's later expansionist policies. He managed to consolidate the fragmented empire and suppress rebellions, which allowed Akbar to focus on other matters once he reached maturity.


**3. With reference to Akbar's policies and administrative reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's religious policy was characterized by unwavering orthodoxy and strict adherence to traditional Islamic practices.
2.  The abolition of the jizya tax and pilgrim tax were among Akbar's initial steps aimed at fostering religious tolerance and equality.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar's religious policies were far from orthodox. While initially a devout Muslim, he later adopted a policy of religious tolerance and syncretism, famously exemplified by his establishment of the Ibadat Khana (House of Worship).  His efforts to foster religious harmony and understanding involved dialogues with representatives of various faiths, and his policies actively sought to bridge religious divides within his diverse empire.  Therefore, the statement is misleading.

Statement 2 is correct.  The abolition of the jizya tax (poll tax on non-Muslims) and the pilgrim tax were among Akbar's earliest and most significant acts aimed at promoting religious equality and reducing discrimination against his Hindu subjects. These actions laid the groundwork for his more comprehensive policy of religious tolerance and laid the foundation for a more inclusive and harmonious society within the Mughal Empire.  These acts demonstrated Akbar’s commitment to religious tolerance and equality.


**4.  With reference to Akbar's relationship with the Rajputs, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's Rajput policy solely relied on military conquest and subjugation to expand his empire.
2.  Akbar's marriage alliances with Rajput rulers, such as the Kachwahas of Amber, were primarily strategic moves to consolidate power and secure loyalty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar's Rajput policy was a multifaceted approach that combined diplomacy and strategic alliances with military actions. While military campaigns were undertaken against resistant Rajput states (like Mewar), Akbar also actively sought to forge alliances and integrate Rajput elites into his administration through matrimonial alliances and grants of mansabs.  His approach was a blend of both force and diplomacy.

Statement 2 is incorrect, though it contains some truth. While strategic considerations played a role in Akbar's Rajput matrimonial alliances (like his marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bharmal of Amber), these unions were more than simply political transactions.  Akbar cultivated genuine relationships with his Rajput in-laws, integrating them into the Mughal court and granting them high positions of power and influence. The marriages were a significant factor in solidifying his relationship with the Rajput rulers but were not purely political.  The relationships were fostered on mutual respect and trust.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the architecture of the Mughal Empire:**

1. The Taj Mahal, a monument to Shah Jahan's love for Mumtaz Mahal, solely employed indigenous Indian architectural styles and techniques.
2.  Fatehpur Sikri, built by Akbar, showcases a blend of architectural styles, including influences from Gujarat and Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Taj Mahal is a magnificent example of Mughal architecture, its design is a fusion of various architectural influences, including Persian, Ottoman, and Indian elements. The pietra dura inlay work, the use of marble, and the overall design principles showcase a synthesis of different architectural traditions, not solely indigenous Indian styles. The architectural elements combined Indian and Persian styles.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's Fatehpur Sikri is a remarkable example of architectural syncretism.  The complex incorporates elements of Gujarat and Bengal architectural styles, including features like deep eaves, balconies, and kiosks. This demonstrates Akbar's willingness to integrate diverse regional styles into his imperial architecture, reflecting the multicultural nature of his empire. The architectural style is a blend of different elements.


**6. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan Sultanates, consider the following statements:**

1. The Deccan Sultanates were primarily characterized by religious intolerance and suppression of non-Muslim cultures.
2.  The Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur and the Charminar in Hyderabad are prominent examples of the architectural achievements of the Deccan Sultanates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While periods of religious tension existed, the Deccan Sultanates were not uniformly characterized by religious intolerance. Several rulers, like Ali Adil Shah of Bijapur, demonstrated remarkable religious tolerance, patronizing both Hindu and Muslim scholars and artists. The Deccan Sultanates displayed significant cultural and religious syncretism, showcasing a blend of Hindu and Muslim traditions in various aspects of life. The statement is incorrect and misleading.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gol Gumbaz, a mausoleum in Bijapur, and the Charminar in Hyderabad are iconic examples of the architectural achievements of the Deccan Sultanates. These structures highlight the sophisticated architectural skills and aesthetic sensibilities of the period, showcasing a unique blend of architectural styles and techniques.  These are well-known architectural marvels of the Deccan Sultanates.


**7. With reference to the Mughal administrative system under Jahangir and Shah Jahan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The mansabdari system, established under Akbar, remained largely unchanged during the reigns of Jahangir and Shah Jahan, without any significant reforms or modifications.
2.  Jahangir and Shah Jahan actively promoted the inclusion of Hindus and other non-Muslim communities within the Mughal nobility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the mansabdari system, a crucial element of the Mughal military and administrative structure, was inherited from Akbar's reign, Jahangir and Shah Jahan implemented several reforms and modifications to improve its efficiency and address some of its inherent weaknesses.  They refined the system's structure, clarified procedures, and sought to enhance its effectiveness.  The system was refined and improved during their reigns.

Statement 2 is correct. Both Jahangir and Shah Jahan continued and even expanded upon Akbar's policy of integrating Hindus and other non-Muslim communities into the Mughal nobility.  This policy aimed at broadening the empire's political base and fostering a sense of inclusion. The inclusion of Marathas in the nobility under Jahangir and Shah Jahan is a notable example of this policy.  The policy continued and expanded during their reigns.


**8.  With reference to the Mughal period's cultural and religious developments, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on promoting religious orthodoxy and strict adherence to traditional Hindu rituals.
2.  The Adi Granth, the Sikh scripture, was compiled during the reign of Guru Arjun Dev.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement was characterized by a diverse range of approaches, but its central theme was devotion to a personal god, often transcending the rigid boundaries of traditional Hindu orthodoxy.  Many Bhakti saints emphasized a more inclusive and personal approach to faith, appealing to people from all castes and backgrounds.  The movement promoted personal devotion and not religious orthodoxy.

Statement 2 is correct. Guru Arjun Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, oversaw the compilation of the Adi Granth (also known as Guru Granth Sahib), the central scripture of Sikhism. This compilation represents a significant milestone in the development of Sikh religious thought and practice. The compilation of the Adi Granth is a significant event in Sikh history.


**9. With reference to the war of succession among Shah Jahan's sons, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dara Shikoh, Shah Jahan's eldest son, was widely popular among all sections of the Mughal nobility and faced no opposition in his bid for the throne.
2. Aurangzeb's victory in the war of succession was significantly influenced by his strategic alliances and effective military leadership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dara Shikoh's claim to the throne was met with significant opposition from his brothers, particularly Aurangzeb.  The Mughal nobility was deeply divided in its allegiances, with various factions supporting different princes. Dara Shikoh's perceived religious liberalism alienated some powerful conservative elements within the nobility. The statement is therefore incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. Aurangzeb's success in the war of succession was largely due to his astute political maneuvering and effective military strategies. He forged crucial alliances, particularly with some Rajput rulers, while his superior military tactics and leadership proved decisive in several key battles, such as the Battle of Dharmat.  His military prowess and strategic alliances played a crucial role in his victory.  His ability to win over key allies proved crucial to his success.


**1. With reference to the architectural features of early Turkish buildings in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The use of arches and domes in Turkish architecture in India was a completely novel invention, unique to their style.
2.  To adhere to Islamic principles, early Turkish buildings in India avoided the depiction of human or animal figures, instead opting for floral scrolls and Quranic verses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The use of arches and domes in Turkish architecture in India was not a novel invention.  While the Turks extensively employed these elements, they were not originally Turkish or Muslim inventions.  The Arabs adopted and developed them from Roman architecture via the Byzantine Empire, and subsequently, Turkish builders in India utilized this established architectural technology.  The innovation lay in the widespread and skillful application of these pre-existing forms, particularly in adapting them to the construction of large, pillar-free halls within mosques and palaces.  The mastery of constructing sturdy arches and domes, requiring high-quality mortar, was a significant architectural achievement in North India during this period.

Statement 2 is correct.  Early Turkish architecture in India, in keeping with Islamic artistic sensibilities, largely avoided the depiction of animate beings in their buildings. This stemmed from a theological interpretation that deemed the representation of humans and animals as un-Islamic.  Therefore, they substituted these figures with intricate geometrical patterns, floral designs, and panels inscribed with verses from the Quran.  This decorative style, known as arabesque, became a hallmark of early Turkish architecture in the region, demonstrating a fusion of Islamic principles with existing indigenous artistic skills.  The intricate carvings, often covering almost every inch of the walls, showcase the mastery of Indian stone-cutters employed by the Turkish rulers.


**2. With reference to the Qutub Minar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Qutub Minar was originally built as a Sufi shrine dedicated to the venerated Delhi saint, Qutab-ud-Din Bakhtiyar Kaki.
2.  The Qutub Minar’s unique aesthetic effect stems from the skillful projection and integration of balconies, the use of contrasting red and white sandstone and marble, and its ribbed structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Qutub Minar was not originally built as a Sufi shrine dedicated to Qutab-ud-Din Bakhtiyar Kaki.  While the minaret is now associated with the saint, its initial purpose was as part of the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque.  The name "Qutub Minar" is a later designation; it was not known by that name during the time of its construction. The association with the Sufi saint developed later through popular tradition.  This highlights the evolution of historical narratives and the complexities of interpreting historical monuments.

Statement 2 is correct. The Qutub Minar's distinctive visual appeal is indeed the result of a combination of skillful architectural techniques and material choices.  The way the balconies are seamlessly integrated into the main tower, the strategic use of red and white sandstone and marble in panels, creating a striking contrast and visual rhythm, and the characteristic ribbed effect all contribute to its unique aesthetic impact.  These features demonstrate the high level of architectural skill and artistic sensibility achieved during this period. The tapering structure itself, originally 71.4 meters high, is a testament to the engineering prowess of the builders.


**3. With reference to the architectural styles prevalent during the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Tughlaq period in Delhi Sultanate architecture is characterized by the consistent use of "batter" (sloping walls) and a complete rejection of the lintel and beam method in favor of arches.
2.  Firuz Tughlaq's buildings demonstrate a distinctive departure from the Tughlaq architectural style by avoiding the use of "batter" and by combining arch and lintel-beam construction methods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Tughlaq period is indeed known for its use of "batter," a prominent architectural feature providing an impression of strength and solidity, it’s inaccurate to say they completely rejected the lintel and beam method.  Tughlaq architecture often incorporated a blend of architectural principles, combining arches with the traditional Indian lintel and beam technique.  This shows an attempt at synthesizing different architectural traditions. The use of "batter" is a distinctive feature, but not the sole defining characteristic of Tughlaq architecture.

Statement 2 is correct. Firuz Tughlaq's architectural projects noticeably diverged from the typical Tughlaq style.  His buildings conspicuously lacked the "batter" effect seen in earlier Tughlaq structures. More significantly, he consciously combined the arch with the lintel and beam method, demonstrating a willingness to integrate multiple architectural approaches. This demonstrates a departure from the architectural trends set by his predecessors.  This eclectic approach reflects a broader shift within the Delhi Sultanate's architectural landscape.


**4. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's Rajput policy exclusively relied on matrimonial alliances as a means to secure alliances and consolidate his empire.
2.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax in 1564 and his policy of religious tolerance were integral parts of his broader strategy to forge alliances with Rajput rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While matrimonial alliances were a significant component of Akbar's Rajput policy, it wasn't the sole method employed to establish alliances.  Akbar strategically combined matrimonial alliances with other political and religious strategies to achieve his goals.  For instance, some Rajput rulers, such as the Hadas of Ranthambhor, maintained strong relations with Akbar despite the absence of matrimonial ties.  This indicates a more nuanced approach than solely relying on marriage alliances.  Akbar's policy was flexible and adapted to the specific circumstances of each Rajput state.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax, a significant religious tax imposed on non-Muslims, and his broader policy of religious tolerance were indeed integral to his Rajput policy.  These measures were not merely acts of benevolence but strategically designed to appease the Rajput rulers and reduce religious tensions. By demonstrating religious tolerance, Akbar aimed to create a more inclusive environment. This fostered better relations with Hindu rulers and facilitated their integration into the Mughal administrative structure.  This policy of religious tolerance was a crucial element in the consolidation of his empire.


**5. With reference to the economic and social impact of the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the upper castes and did not significantly impact the lower castes or tribal populations.
2.  The Bhakti movement's emphasis on devotion and rejection of caste rigidities contributed to the expansion of Hinduism, the assimilation of tribal populations, and the strengthening of the position of Brahmins and rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement's influence extended far beyond the upper castes.  Many of the prominent Bhakti saints, like the Alvars and Nayanmars, came from lower castes. Their teachings emphasized devotion and love for God, transcending caste barriers and making the path of Bhakti accessible to all, irrespective of social standing. This accessibility contributed to its widespread appeal among lower castes and tribal populations. The movement challenged the rigid caste system prevalent in Hindu society.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bhakti movement played a significant role in the expansion of Hinduism by attracting adherents from Buddhism and Jainism.  It further integrated tribal populations into the Hindu fold by assimilating their local deities into the broader Hindu pantheon.  While the movement challenged caste rigidities, it also indirectly strengthened the position of Brahmins, particularly as the teachings of the Alvars were systematized and incorporated into orthodox Hindu traditions by Brahmin scholars.  The temples, which became centers of Bhakti, also enhanced the power and influence of both Brahmins and rulers.  The movement had profound economic and social consequences.


**1. With reference to Chola temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dravida style, prevalent in South India, featured multi-storied vimana structures above the garbhagriha, typically ranging from five to seven stories.
2. Chola temples often incorporated pillared mandapas, serving as audience halls and spaces for ceremonial dances performed by devadasis, and were frequently enclosed within courtyards featuring towering gopurams.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key features of Chola temple architecture.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Dravida style's characteristic multi-storied vimana (the tower above the sanctum sanctorum) and its typical height.  The text explicitly mentions the vimana's multiple stories and its location above the garbhagriha (innermost chamber). Statement 2 is also accurate, describing the common inclusion of pillared mandapas (assembly halls) used for various purposes, including audiences and dances by devadasis (temple dancers). The description of courtyards surrounded by walls and accessed through imposing gopurams (gateways) further supports this statement. The architectural details described align perfectly with the historical record of Chola temple construction.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements, neglecting significant aspects of Chola temple design and functionality.


**2. With reference to the Chola Empire's administrative structure, consider the following statements:**

1. The basic unit of Chola administration was the valanadu, comprising several nadus, which were further grouped into mandalams or provinces.
2.  Chola villages, particularly Brahman villages (agraharams), enjoyed significant autonomy through assemblies like the ur and the mahasabha, which managed local affairs and resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the significant local self-governance in Chola villages, especially the agraharams (Brahman settlements).  The text details the functioning of the ur (general assembly) and the mahasabha (assembly of adult men in Brahman villages), highlighting their roles in managing village affairs, resources, and even land distribution.  Statement 1, however, is incorrect in its description of the administrative hierarchy. While the text mentions nadus (groups of villages) and mandalams (provinces), it states that the *basic* unit was the *zadu* (a group of villages with close kinship ties), not the valanadu.  Valanadus were indeed a larger administrative unit, but they were composed of nadus, not the other way around as stated in option 1.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, reflecting the accurate depiction of Chola village self-governance. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1 concerning the basic administrative unit.


**3. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola period witnessed the climax of Dravidian temple architecture, exemplified by the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, and also saw the flourishing of Tamil literature, notably Kamban's Ramayana.
2.  Chola rulers actively patronized Sanskrit literature alongside regional languages, and their administrative records, often inscribed on temple walls, provide valuable historical insights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the Chola Empire's significant cultural contributions. Statement 1 correctly highlights the peak of Dravidian architecture during the Chola period, using the Brihadisvara Temple as a prime example. The text explicitly mentions this temple and underscores the flourishing of Tamil literature, specifically citing Kamban's Ramayana as a classic. Statement 2 is also correct; while Tamil was a prominent language, the Chola period also saw the continued use and patronage of Sanskrit, a language of high culture.  The practice of inscribing historical narratives on temple walls, mentioned in the text, supports the claim of valuable historical insights gleaned from these inscriptions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to recognize the dual aspects of Chola cultural achievements—architectural prowess and literary flourishing in both Tamil and Sanskrit.


**4. With reference to post-Chola temple building activity, consider the following statements:**

1.  Following the Chola decline, temple construction continued under the Hoysalas, resulting in magnificent structures like the Hoysalesvara Temple at Halebid, showcasing the Chalukyan style.
2. The Chalukyas of Kalyani and the Hoysalas primarily focused on building temples dedicated to Vishnu, reflecting a shift in religious patronage compared to the Chola period's emphasis on Shiva.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the continuation of temple building activity after the Cholas, specifically mentioning the Hoysalas' contribution and the architectural style. The text explicitly mentions the Hoysalesvara Temple at Halebid as a prime example of the Chalukyan style.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect. While the text mentions the Chalukyas and Hoysalas building numerous temples, it does not specify a predominance of Vishnu temples over Shiva temples. The text doesn't provide enough information to support a claim of a specific religious shift in temple patronage. The focus is on the continuation of temple building, and the architectural styles, not on a detailed religious analysis of the temples constructed.  Therefore, only statement 1 is demonstrably correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the unsupported assertion in statement 2 regarding religious preference in temple construction.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Chola Empire's economic activities:**

1.  The Chola economy relied heavily on land revenue, supplemented by tolls on trade and taxes on professions, but lacked a robust system of coinage until the tenth century.
2.  Chola temples amassed considerable wealth, engaging in business activities such as lending money and participating in commercial enterprises, contributing significantly to the empire's economic prosperity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's economy. Statement 1 correctly identifies the sources of Chola revenue, including land tax, trade tolls, and professional taxes.  The text mentions the lack of widespread gold coinage until the tenth century, supporting the statement's claim. Statement 2 is also correct, describing the significant economic role of Chola temples. The text explicitly states that some temples accumulated vast wealth, engaging in lending and business ventures, thereby contributing substantially to the empire's overall economic strength.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements regarding the revenue sources and the economic role of Chola temples.  Both statements present accurate and verifiable aspects of the Chola economic system.


**1. With reference to the architectural features adopted by the Turks in North India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Turks extensively used arches and domes in their buildings, though these architectural elements were not of Turkish or Muslim origin.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the Turks, upon arriving in India, adopted the arch and dome extensively in their constructions.  It's crucial to note that the text highlights the fact that these were not original Turkish or Muslim inventions, but rather elements adopted and further developed from earlier civilizations (Byzantine and Roman). This directly supports statement 1.  Statement 2 is also supported by the text's detailed description of the decorative style employed by the Turks. They avoided figural representation due to Islamic sensibilities, opting instead for geometric patterns, floral motifs, and the incorporation of Quranic verses into the arabesque style. The detailed description of arabesque and the avoidance of human/animal figures clearly supports statement 2. Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while (d) is entirely incorrect based on the provided information.

**1. With reference to Mughal Architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram exemplifies a pre-Mughal architectural style, representing a transition point towards the Mughal style.
2.  Akbar's Fatehpur Sikri complex incorporated architectural elements from Gujarat and Bengal, showcasing a blend of regional styles within a larger Mughal framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram is indeed considered a masterpiece of pre-Mughal architecture, showcasing the culmination of earlier styles and acting as a significant precursor to the Mughal architectural style.  Its design and construction techniques influenced subsequent Mughal works.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Fatehpur Sikri complex, built by Akbar, is known for its eclectic architectural style. It prominently features elements borrowed from Gujarat and Bengal, demonstrating Akbar's willingness to integrate regional styles into the developing Mughal architectural idiom. The use of deep eaves, balconies, and kiosks are examples of this regional influence.  This eclecticism is a key feature distinguishing Akbar's architectural patronage.


**2. With reference to Mughal Painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal school of painting under Jahangir saw a rise in portraiture and animal painting, with Mansur being a prominent artist known for his realistic depictions.
2.  Under Akbar, European painting techniques, like foreshortening, were introduced, influencing the evolution of the Mughal style and adding depth to its artistic expression.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Jahangir's reign is a high point in Mughal painting, particularly for portraiture and depictions of animals. Mansur, a renowned artist of the period, is famous for his exceptionally realistic and detailed animal paintings, a testament to the growing sophistication of Mughal artistic techniques.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The arrival of Portuguese priests during Akbar's reign introduced European painting techniques, including the principle of foreshortening—creating the illusion of depth and perspective. This significantly impacted Mughal painting's evolution, moving it beyond the relatively flat styles of its Persian predecessors.


**3. With reference to Akbar's Reign and Policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's Ibadat Khana, initially a space for Muslim theological discussions, was later opened to people of all faiths, reflecting his growing interest in religious tolerance and syncretism.
2.  Akbar's Rajput policy focused solely on matrimonial alliances, with marriages being the primary means of securing political alliances and consolidating his empire.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ibadat Khana, initially intended for discussions among Muslim theologians, evolved under Akbar's patronage into a space for interfaith dialogue. This reflects Akbar's growing interest in religious tolerance and his attempts to understand different faiths.  The inclusion of individuals from various religious backgrounds in these discussions is a significant aspect of his religious policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Akbar did utilize matrimonial alliances as a tool for securing political alliances with Rajput rulers, his Rajput policy was far more multifaceted. It encompassed not just marriages but also the granting of high offices and mansabs to Rajput nobles, regardless of religious affiliation,  and the implementation of policies promoting religious tolerance.  The integration of Rajputs into the Mughal nobility was a crucial component of his strategy to consolidate his empire.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Mughal administrative practices:**

1.  Akbar's division of the empire into twelve subas in 1580 established a system of provincial governance with checks and balances, enhancing administrative efficiency and control.
2.  The Mughal mansabdari system solely focused on military appointments, neglecting the administrative and civil aspects of governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's reorganization of the empire into twelve subas in 1580 was a significant administrative reform.  The establishment of a structured provincial administration with clearly defined roles for governors (subedars), diwans, bakhshis, sadrs, qazis, and waqia-navis created a system of checks and balances, promoting efficiency and accountability in governance across the vast empire.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the mansabdari system primarily focused on military organization and ranking, it also encompassed administrative and civil responsibilities.  Mansabdars held various positions within the Mughal administration, extending beyond purely military roles.  The system was designed to integrate military and administrative functions, not solely focus on military appointments.


**5. With reference to the Mughal Empire's expansion, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's conquest of Malwa in 1561 was a swift and decisive victory, leading to the immediate and complete subjugation of the region.
2.  Akbar's campaigns against the Uzbeks, spanning several years, involved multiple rebellions and required persistent military action to fully consolidate Mughal control in the north-west.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar's forces did initially defeat Baz Bahadur in Malwa in 1561, it was not a complete and lasting victory. Baz Bahadur was able to regain control of Malwa due to the subsequent unpopularity of Mughal rule. Further campaigns were needed to fully secure Mughal control of the region.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's dealings with the Uzbeks were protracted and involved multiple rebellions.  The Uzbeks represented a significant challenge to Mughal authority in the north-west, requiring sustained military engagement and several campaigns before Akbar could finally establish his control.  The prolonged nature of these conflicts demonstrates the complexities of Mughal expansion.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the subject matter, going beyond simple factual recall.


**1. With reference to Akbar's administrative and political strategies, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's daily routine included a public appearance at the jharoka, followed by an open darbar (diwan-i-am) to address public petitions.
2.  The twelve subas established by Akbar in 1580 included Bengal, Bihar, Allahabad, Awadh, Agra, Delhi, Lahore, Multan, Kabul, Ajmer, Malwa, and Gujarat, each governed by a team of officials with checks and balances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Akbar's administrative system.  Statement 1 correctly describes Akbar's use of the jharoka darshan (public appearance) and the open darbar to maintain direct contact with his subjects and address their grievances. This was a crucial element of his public image and accessibility.  Statement 2 is also accurate in outlining the twelve subas and the system of checks and balances employed within each province. The appointment of multiple officials—subedar (governor), diwan (finance minister), bakhshi (military paymaster), sadr (religious judge), qazi (judicial judge), and waqia-navis (recorder)—was designed to prevent corruption and ensure efficient governance. The division into subas and the structure of provincial administration were key components of Akbar's strategy for consolidating and expanding the Mughal empire.


**2. With reference to Akbar's Rajput policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's marriage alliances with Rajput rulers were solely driven by strategic political considerations, with little regard for personal relationships or religious tolerance.
2.  The Hadas of Ranthambhor remained high in Akbar's favor despite the absence of a matrimonial alliance, demonstrating that such alliances were not a precondition for political cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar's Rajput policy certainly involved strategic political gains, it also incorporated a degree of genuine respect and tolerance. His relationships with his Rajput wives were marked by religious freedom granted to them, and he elevated their families to positions of power within the Mughal nobility.  This contrasts with the practice of earlier rulers who often neglected or marginalized their Hindu wives. Statement 2 accurately reflects an important nuance of Akbar's Rajput policy. The example of the Hadas illustrates that matrimonial alliances, while advantageous, were not an absolute requirement for securing the loyalty and cooperation of Rajput rulers. Akbar's success stemmed from a flexible approach that combined strategic alliances with a policy of religious tolerance and the granting of autonomy.


**3. With reference to Akbar's religious policies and their impact, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax in 1564 was primarily aimed at appeasing the powerful Rajput elites and solidifying his alliances with them.
2. The abolition of the jizya and pilgrim taxes, along with the cessation of forced conversions, significantly contributed to the consolidation of Akbar's empire by fostering religious harmony among his diverse subjects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the abolition of the jizya tax in 1564 undoubtedly benefited Akbar's relationships with the Rajputs (Statement 1), it was not solely motivated by that goal. The tax was viewed as a symbol of Muslim dominance and a source of resentment among the non-Muslim population.  Abolishing it was a broader policy choice reflecting Akbar's commitment to religious tolerance and his intent to create a more unified and harmonious empire. Statement 2 is also correct. The removal of these discriminatory taxes, along with the end of forced conversions, fostered a climate of religious tolerance. This contributed significantly to the stability and growth of the Mughal empire by reducing internal conflict and attracting the support of various communities.  Akbar's religious policies were not merely tactical maneuvers; they were integral to his broader vision of a unified and prosperous empire.


**4. With reference to Shah Jahan's Deccan policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Shah Jahan's initial strategy in the Deccan involved military aggression against Bijapur, followed by diplomatic negotiations to secure a favorable treaty.
2. The 1636 treaty with Bijapur resulted in Bijapur's recognition of Mughal suzerainty, payment of indemnity, and non-interference in Golconda's affairs, while also ceding territory to Bijapur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Shah Jahan's approach to the Deccan involved a combination of military pressure and diplomacy (Statement 1). He initially sent a large army to pressure Bijapur, signaling his resolve. This pressure, coupled with Shah Jahan's offer to revive an earlier accord, created a conducive environment for negotiation. Statement 2 correctly describes the outcome of the 1636 treaty.  Bijapur acknowledged Mughal suzerainty, paid a significant indemnity, pledged non-interference in Golconda's affairs (which came under Mughal protection), and agreed to resolve any future disputes with Golconda through Mughal arbitration.  Critically, Shah Jahan also ceded territory to Bijapur, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to securing a stable peace. This treaty effectively established Mughal dominance in the Deccan, achieving Akbar's long-term objectives.


**5. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1. Ibrahim Adil Shah II's patronage of music and the arts, as evidenced by his composition of the Kitab-i-Nawras, showcased a synthesis of Hindu and Muslim cultural traditions.
2. Golconda's intellectual prominence was marked by the patronage of Urdu literature under Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, who is also renowned for his architectural achievements including the Charminar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the cultural synthesis under Ibrahim Adil Shah II.  His work, *Kitab-i-Nawras*, a collection of songs set to various ragas, demonstrates the blending of musical traditions.  His invocation of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of music and learning, within his compositions further emphasizes this cultural fusion. This highlights the religious tolerance and cultural exchange prevalent in Bijapur.  Statement 2 is also correct. Golconda thrived as a center of learning and artistic innovation.  Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, a patron of Urdu literature, is remembered for his contributions to the development of Dakhini Urdu. He is also known for his architectural legacy, most notably the Charminar in Hyderabad. The Charminar represents not only architectural skill but also the flourishing culture of Golconda during this period.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding Sher Shah Suri's reign:**

1. Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram is considered a significant architectural achievement, marking a transition between pre-Mughal and Mughal architectural styles.
2. Sher Shah Suri's administration was marked by religious tolerance, as evidenced by his policies towards Hindus and his lack of dependence on the ulama.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the architectural significance of Sher Shah Suri's tomb at Sasaram.  It's recognized as a masterpiece of its time, representing a crucial bridge between pre-Mughal and the later Mughal architectural styles. Its design and construction exemplify the high level of architectural skill during his reign. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Sher Shah Suri did not excessively rely on the ulama,  his reign was not characterized by complete religious tolerance. The continuation of the jizya tax and the incident involving Puran Mal demonstrate that religious considerations influenced some of his policies, though not to the same extent as some of his successors.  The question highlights the need for nuanced understanding of historical figures and their policies, moving beyond simple labels of "tolerant" or "intolerant."


**7. With reference to Akbar's early reign and consolidation of power, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's accession to the throne was immediately followed by a period of stability and undisputed authority, allowing him to focus on expanding the empire.
2.  The suppression of the Uzbek rebellions between 1561 and 1567, including the crisis involving Mirza Hakim's incursion into the Punjab, was crucial in establishing Akbar's full authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Akbar's early reign was far from stable; he faced numerous challenges in consolidating his power. The immediate threat from Hemu, followed by conflicts with powerful nobles and several rebellions, tested his leadership and military skills. The statement ignores the significant struggles he faced. Statement 2 correctly identifies the importance of quelling the Uzbek rebellions. These rebellions, coupled with the threat from Mirza Hakim, posed a serious challenge to Akbar's rule. Their suppression was pivotal in establishing his authority and providing him the stability needed to launch his ambitious expansionist policies. The question tests the examinee's knowledge of the complexities of Akbar's early reign and the significance of specific events in his consolidation of power.


**8.  With reference to Mughal architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The use of running water as a feature in Mughal palaces and gardens, exemplified by structures like the Nishat Bagh, was a distinctive element of Mughal architectural style.
2.  Akbar's construction projects, including the Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, showcased a blend of indigenous Indian architectural traditions with influences from Persia and Central Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements highlight key features of Mughal architecture. Statement 1 correctly points out the innovative use of water features in Mughal architecture.  The incorporation of running water in gardens and palaces was not merely decorative but also served practical purposes and reflected a sophisticated understanding of water management.  Structures like the Nishat Bagh in Kashmir are prime examples of this distinctive element.  Statement 2 accurately describes the architectural style of Akbar's buildings.  The Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri exemplify the Mughal synthesis of Indian architectural traditions with influences from Central Asia and Persia, as seen in the use of materials, designs, and overall layout. The blend of styles is a defining characteristic of Mughal architecture.


**9. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1. Mughal painting developed in isolation from existing Indian artistic traditions, establishing a completely new and unique style.
2.  The Mughal school of painting under Jahangir excelled in portraiture and animal painting, with artists like Mansur achieving renown for their skill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Mughal painting did not develop in isolation; it built upon and incorporated elements of pre-existing Indian artistic traditions. While introducing new themes, colors, and forms, the Mughal style absorbed and adapted elements from indigenous Indian painting. The statement fails to recognize this important interaction and synthesis. Statement 2 correctly highlights the achievements of the Mughal school under Jahangir.  Jahangir's patronage and discerning eye led to a flourishing of portraiture and animal painting, with artists like Mansur gaining international recognition for their exceptional skill. The question tests the understanding of the evolution and characteristics of Mughal painting.


**10. With reference to the political and administrative developments during the first half of the 17th century, consider the following statements:**

1. Jahangir and Shah Jahan, as Mughal rulers, largely maintained Akbar's administrative system, while also expanding the empire's political base through alliances with diverse groups.
2.  The Mughal empire during this period focused solely on internal consolidation and stability, neglecting foreign relations and trade with European companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the continuity and expansion of Mughal administration during the reigns of Jahangir and Shah Jahan.  They largely retained Akbar's efficient administrative structure, while also strategically forging alliances with various groups, including Rajputs, Afghans, and Marathas, to broaden the empire's political support base.  The statement accurately captures the pragmatic approach of these rulers. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Mughal empire under Jahangir and Shah Jahan did not isolate itself from foreign relations.  They actively engaged with neighboring Asian powers, such as Iran and the Ottoman Empire, and also interacted with European trading companies, granting them concessions to promote India's foreign trade.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate view of Mughal foreign policy.  The question tests the understanding of the complexities of Mughal administration and foreign policy.


**11. With reference to the Jat and Sikh uprisings against Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat uprisings were primarily agrarian in nature, rooted in conflicts over land revenue and zamindari rights, and involved a significant peasant component.
2. The Sikh movement, unlike the Jat uprisings, was primarily a religious movement with little political or territorial ambition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Jat uprisings.  These were largely agrarian movements stemming from disputes over land revenue and zamindari rights. While initially involving peasant cultivators, they evolved to incorporate zamindars and eventually led to the establishment of independent Jat principalities. The statement correctly emphasizes the agrarian roots of the conflict. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Sikh movement had a strong religious core under Guru Gobind Singh, it also had significant political and territorial dimensions. The movement increasingly challenged Mughal authority, ultimately leading to the formation of independent Sikh states in the following centuries.  The statement misrepresents the multifaceted nature of the Sikh movement. The question tests the understanding of the motivations and characteristics of different resistance movements against Aurangzeb.


**12. With reference to Akbar's foreign policy and relations with Central Asian powers, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's primary objective in his interactions with Central Asian powers was to annex territories such as Badakhshan and Balkh to his empire.
2. The agreement reached with Abdullah Khan Uzbek, implicitly defining the Hindukush as the boundary, resulted in a stable and lasting peace between the Mughal Empire and the Uzbek Khanate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar did have interests in Central Asian territories, his primary objective in his interactions with Central Asian powers, particularly the Uzbeks, was to secure the northwestern frontier of his empire and prevent incursions and instability.  The statement oversimplifies Akbar's strategic goals. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the agreement with Abdullah Khan Uzbek did temporarily stabilize the frontier, it was not a lasting peace.  The region remained volatile, and the issue of Qandhar continued to be a source of tension. The statement misrepresents the long-term stability of the border. The question tests the examinee's understanding of the nuances of Akbar's foreign policy and the complexities of relations with Central Asian powers.  The emphasis is on strategic considerations rather than simple territorial ambition.


**13. With reference to the Bahmani Kingdom and its successor states, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud Gawan, a prominent minister in the Bahmani kingdom, implemented significant administrative reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs).
2. The disintegration of the Bahmani kingdom led directly to the rise of the Vijayanagara Empire as the dominant power in South India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Mahmud Gawan's contributions to the Bahmani administration.  He implemented key reforms, including the division of the kingdom into eight provinces (tarafs) with a structured system of governance and salary distribution. His efforts aimed at strengthening the kingdom's internal stability and efficiency. The statement correctly highlights his administrative prowess. Statement 2 is incorrect. The disintegration of the Bahmani kingdom led to the emergence of several independent Deccan sultanates (Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Bidar).  The Vijayanagara Empire, while a significant power in South India, was not directly a beneficiary of the Bahmani kingdom's collapse. The statement presents an inaccurate causal relationship between the two events.  The question tests the understanding of the political dynamics in South India and the internal structures of the Bahmani kingdom.


**14.  With reference to the early Turkish conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The battles of Tarain (1191 and 1192) marked the beginning of widespread Turkish rule in North India, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  Bakhtiyar Khalji's expeditions into Bihar and Bengal resulted in the destruction of several prominent Buddhist monasteries, such as Nalanda and Vikramshila, and the establishment of Turkish control over Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the early Turkish conquests. Statement 1 correctly identifies the battles of Tarain as pivotal in establishing Turkish dominance in North India.  These victories laid the groundwork for the eventual establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, marking a significant turning point in Indian history.  The statement accurately points to the significance of these battles.  Statement 2 correctly describes Bakhtiyar Khalji's actions in Bihar and Bengal. His expeditions led to the destruction of prominent Buddhist centers like Nalanda and Vikramshila, and he established Turkish control over Bengal, though initially as a relatively independent ruler. The statement accurately describes his impact on the region.  The question tests the understanding of the sequence of events and the impact of early Turkish conquests on India.


**1. With reference to Mughal architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Buland Darwaza, a half-dome portal showcasing Persian influence, was built by Akbar to commemorate his victory in Gujarat.
2.  Shah Jahan's Moti Masjid in Agra Fort, constructed entirely of marble, exemplifies the culmination of Mughal architectural styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The Buland Darwaza at Fatehpur Sikri, a magnificent gateway, was indeed commissioned by Akbar to celebrate his conquest of Gujarat in 1572.  Its design, particularly the use of the half-dome portal, clearly reflects Persian architectural influences, a common feature in Mughal architecture.  This shows Akbar's adoption and adaptation of foreign styles within a distinctly Mughal context.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) within Agra Fort is a prime example of Shah Jahan's architectural prowess.  Built entirely of white marble, it epitomizes the refined elegance and sophisticated use of materials characteristic of his reign.  The mosque's design, along with other structures built during his period, represents a high point in Mughal architectural achievement, blending various elements into a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing whole. The use of marble, intricate detailing, and the overall grandeur reflect the peak of Mughal architectural style.


**2. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mansur, a prominent painter during Jahangir's reign, specialized in depicting birds with exceptional realism.
2.  Akbar's court employed a diverse group of painters, including Hindus and Muslims, leading to a synthesis of Indian and Persian styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mansur was indeed renowned as the greatest painter of birds during the reign of Jahangir. His works are celebrated for their remarkable realism and attention to detail, showcasing the high level of artistic skill achieved during this period.  This specialization within the broader Mughal school of painting highlights the diversity of talent and expertise within the imperial workshop.

Statement 2 is also accurate. Akbar's patronage of art resulted in a flourishing painting workshop that brought together artists from various backgrounds, including Hindus and Muslims.  This collaboration fostered a unique blend of Indian and Persian styles, resulting in a distinctive Mughal painting tradition. The integration of Indian themes and techniques into the Persian style demonstrates the cultural exchange and synthesis that occurred under Akbar's rule.


**3. With reference to the Rajput-Mughal relations under Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's policy of matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers was always a precondition for establishing political alliances.
2.  The Battle of Haldighati, though tactically a Mughal victory, did not result in the immediate subjugation of Mewar under Akbar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Akbar did utilize matrimonial alliances as a tool to forge relationships with Rajput rulers, it wasn't a universal or inflexible prerequisite for political alliances.  He successfully forged alliances with some Rajput states without resorting to such marriages, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to diplomacy that went beyond a rigid policy. This shows the flexibility and adaptability of Akbar's political strategies.

Statement 2 is correct. The Battle of Haldighati in 1576, though resulting in a tactical victory for the Mughals, did not lead to the immediate conquest of Mewar.  Rana Pratap, the ruler of Mewar, continued his resistance against the Mughals through guerrilla warfare, showcasing the tenacity of Rajput resistance against Mughal expansion. This protracted conflict highlights the limitations of military might and the persistence of regional power struggles.


**4.  With reference to Sher Shah Suri's reign, consider the following statements:**

This highlights the complexities of imperial expansion and the challenges of maintaining control over newly conquered territories.  Such events illustrate the importance of effective governance and leadership in consolidating imperial power.

Statement 2 is incorrect or at best, incomplete. While control over resources was a factor in Akbar's expansionist policies, the campaign against Malwa was not solely driven by the desire to secure precious stones and minerals.  Strategic considerations, such as consolidating control over a key region and eliminating potential rivals, played equally important roles.  This emphasizes the multifaceted nature of Mughal expansionism.  Focusing only on resources oversimplifies the complex political and strategic motives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Mughal emperors did not consistently suppress all forms of music and artistic expression.  While Aurangzeb's personal preferences leaned towards religious orthodoxy, the practice of music and other art forms continued under the patronage of other Mughal rulers, their queens, and nobles.  This shows that Mughal attitudes towards artistic expression were not monolithic and varied across rulers and social circles.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate portrayal of Mughal cultural policies.

1.  The Bhakti movement played a crucial role in the maturation and literary use of regional languages, with saints often employing vernaculars for their compositions.
2.  While some regional languages like Tamil had ancient origins, others such as Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi emerged during this period from earlier vernaculars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**3. With reference to the musical landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's patronage of Tansen of Gwalior led to the composition of many new ragas, and this tradition of musical patronage continued under subsequent Mughal emperors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Guru Har Govind did have conflicts with Shah Jahan, these were largely political and personal in nature, stemming from incidents like a hunting dispute and a land issue, rather than systematic religious persecution.  The question highlights the complexity of historical events, requiring careful analysis to distinguish between politically motivated actions and religious persecution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Chola temple architecture. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Dravida style's defining characteristics—multiple storeys above the garbhagriha (innermost chamber)—and its geographical concentration in South India during the Chola period's zenith.  The Dravidian style represents a significant achievement in South Indian architecture, known for its towering vimana (tower above the sanctum) and intricate carvings.  This style, while having regional variations, became a hallmark of the Chola era's architectural prowess.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Brihadisvara Temple at Tanjore, built by Rajaraja I, is widely recognized as a prime example of the advanced Dravida style. The temple's grandeur and intricate details are celebrated even today. The inclusion of royal images in temple courtyards was a Chola practice, further solidifying the temple's status as a reflection of royal power and religious devotion. The temple's immense size and the technical skill involved in its construction showcase the advanced engineering and artistic capabilities of the Chola period.


Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they exclude one of the factually correct statements. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are historically accurate representations of Chola temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Gangaikondacholapuram was indeed the Chola capital, it is presently a small village and  few, if any,  palace structures from the Chola period survive. The passage explicitly states that none of the palaces of that period have survived.  This highlights the passage of time and the vulnerability of historical structures to decay and destruction.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Chola period witnessed a flourishing of Tamil literature. Kamban's Ramayana is a celebrated work of this era, demonstrating the Chola rulers' support for literary arts and the development of regional languages. Kamban's adaptation of the Ramayana into Tamil demonstrates the assimilation of classical themes into regional cultural expressions.

Option (a) is incorrect because it claims only Statement 1 is correct, which is factually wrong. Option (c) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy of Statement 1. Option (d) is incorrect because Statement 2 is demonstrably true.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Hoysalesvara Temple at Halebid is a masterpiece of Chalukyan architecture, known for its elaborate sculptures that seamlessly blend religious iconography with depictions of everyday life, music, dance, war, and love.  The detailed carvings reflect the high standard of sculpture achieved during this era and demonstrate the close integration of life and religion in South Indian society.  The temple's architecture and sculpture are also significant for understanding the social dynamics and artistic sensibilities of the period.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that temple building continued under the Chalukyas of Kalyani and the Hoysalas after the fall of the Cholas. This indicates a continuity of architectural traditions and religious devotion even after the change in political power.  The continuation of temple construction highlights the enduring significance of religious institutions and their role in shaping South Indian society.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly assert the cessation of temple building or misrepresent the accuracy of both statements.  Only statement 1 correctly reflects the post-Chola architectural landscape.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions the debate among historians regarding economic conditions and the lack of gold coins before the 10th century, it does not definitively conclude that this signifies a period of overall economic stagnation and decline.  The absence of gold coinage may be due to various factors, and this aspect alone cannot conclusively determine the overall economic health of the region. The text presents a nuanced perspective on this topic, acknowledging the complexity of economic history.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that some of the Chola rulers' activities, including temple construction, were funded through the plunder of neighboring populations. This reveals a facet of Chola imperial power and its impact on the region's economic and social dynamics.  This highlights the relationship between political power, military conquest, and economic resource allocation in the Chola Empire.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the ambiguous nature of Statement 1 or wrongly exclude the accurate Statement 2. Only Statement 2 accurately represents a key aspect of the Chola economic and social landscape.

This shows that the growth of regional literature was not a sudden phenomenon but a gradual process.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text suggests a correlation between the decreasing prestige of Sanskrit and Brahmans and the subsequent rise of regional languages in literature.  This reflects a broader socio-cultural shift where regional identities and vernacular expressions gained prominence.  The rise of Bhakti saints and their use of regional languages further accelerated this process.

1.  The Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque in Delhi exemplifies the early adoption of the true arch in Indian architecture, initially incorporating pre-existing temple structures.
2.  The Alai Darwaza, an entrance to the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, showcases a dome constructed on scientifically sound principles, a significant advancement in the architectural techniques of the period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque's construction involved the repurposing of pre-existing structures, showcasing an early example of the true arch's integration into Indian architecture under the early Turkic rulers.  This represents a significant shift from earlier Indian architectural practices that predominantly utilized lintel and beam systems.  The mosque’s initial structure incorporated elements from a pre-existing temple, demonstrating the adaptation of existing building materials and techniques by the newly arrived Muslim rulers.  This fusion of styles is a crucial aspect of understanding the evolution of Indo-Islamic architecture.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Alai Darwaza, added later by Alauddin Khalji, represents a milestone in the mastery of dome construction techniques.  Unlike earlier attempts which often lacked precise scientific principles in their execution, the Alai Darwaza’s dome was built using scientifically accurate methods, reflecting a significant improvement in engineering and architectural knowledge. This technical advancement allowed for the creation of more structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing domes, which became a hallmark of later architectural styles.  The Alai Darwaza’s design, with its pleasing proportions and sophisticated dome construction, stands as a testament to the evolving skills of Indian craftsmen working under the patronage of the Delhi Sultanate.

1.  Arabesque, a decorative style commonly used in Indo-Islamic architecture, primarily features intricate geometrical and floral patterns, often incorporating Quranic verses.
2.  The incorporation of pre-existing Hindu motifs, such as the bell motif, the ‘el’ motif, and the swastika, into the arabesque style demonstrates a fusion of Hindu and Islamic artistic traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Arabesque, a defining characteristic of Indo-Islamic architecture, avoids the depiction of human or animal figures, adhering to Islamic iconographic restrictions. Instead, it focuses on intricate patterns of geometric shapes and stylized floral designs, often interwoven with calligraphy containing verses from the Quran. The artistic skill involved in creating these complex and harmonious designs is a key element of arabesque's aesthetic appeal and its role in conveying religious and cultural significance.


Statement 2 is also correct. The arabesque style, while rooted in Islamic artistic traditions, demonstrates a notable degree of syncretism by incorporating pre-existing Hindu motifs.  This integration reflects the cultural exchange and adaptation that occurred as the Turkic rulers interacted with the existing Indian population.  The use of familiar Hindu symbols within an Islamic architectural context showcases a deliberate attempt to blend and synthesize artistic traditions, creating a unique Indo-Islamic artistic language. This fusion demonstrates the ability of artistic styles to transcend religious boundaries and adapt to the local cultural context.


**3. With reference to the administrative structure of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *iqta* system, a land revenue assignment system, granted temporary revenue-bearing villages to officials and supporters of the Sultan, theoretically revocable at the Sultan's discretion.
2.  While theoretically temporary, the *iqta* system often evolved into hereditary fiefs, contributing to the decentralization of power and the rise of regional power bases within the Sultanate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the *iqta* system.  The *iqta* was a land grant given by the Sultan to his officials and military commanders in lieu of salaries.  These grants were theoretically temporary and could be revoked or reassigned by the Sultan, depending on the loyalty and performance of the recipient.  This system aimed to maintain centralized control over the vast territories under the Sultanate’s rule. The system ensured the loyalty of the ruling class by providing them with a source of income tied to their service to the Sultan.


Statement 2 is also correct. Although the *iqta* system was designed to be temporary, in practice, it often became hereditary.  Over time, the recipients of *iqtas* consolidated their power in their assigned territories, developing strong regional bases and gradually asserting greater autonomy from the central authority. This shift towards hereditary fiefs led to a degree of decentralization within the Sultanate, undermining the Sultan’s ability to maintain absolute control over the vast empire and contributing to the rise of powerful regional lords who could challenge the Sultan’s authority.  This gradual shift is a crucial factor in understanding the dynamics of power and the eventual decline of the Delhi Sultanate.


**4. With reference to the economic policies of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Alauddin Khalji's economic reforms included price controls on essential commodities and a system of state regulation of markets to ensure affordability for the common people.
2.  Muhammad bin Tughlaq's introduction of a token currency system, while intended to address a silver shortage, ultimately failed due to widespread counterfeiting and a lack of public trust.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Alauddin Khalji implemented a series of stringent economic measures, including price controls on essential goods, to curb inflation and ensure that the prices of food and other necessities remained affordable for the common people. These measures also included the direct state regulation of markets, aiming to control the power of merchants and prevent price manipulation. Although these measures were controversial and had their drawbacks, they do illustrate a significant attempt at state intervention to address economic inequality and ensure social stability.


Statement 2 is also correct.  Muhammad bin Tughlaq's introduction of a token currency system was an ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful economic experiment.  The aim was to alleviate a shortage of silver by introducing bronze coins of equal value to silver tankas. However, the plan failed due to rampant counterfeiting, which eroded public confidence in the new currency, leading to its eventual withdrawal. This failure underscores the challenges of implementing radical economic reforms in a complex socio-economic environment and highlights the importance of public trust and effective enforcement in the success of such policies.  The token currency episode serves as a cautionary tale in economic policymaking.


**5. With reference to the social and cultural landscape of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajput clans, who rose to prominence during this period, often legitimized their newly acquired power and status by tracing their lineage back to ancient Kshatriya families, often with the assistance of Brahmanical genealogists.
2.  The Sufi movement, emerging after the twelfth century, fostered a degree of cultural synthesis by integrating certain Hindu practices and rituals into its system while retaining its core Islamic beliefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the social dynamics of the period. The Rajput clans, who became significant political players, frequently sought to enhance their legitimacy and social standing by constructing elaborate genealogies linking them to ancient Kshatriya lineages.  This process involved collaboration with Brahmanical scholars who created narratives tracing Rajput origins to renowned families mentioned in ancient texts like the Mahabharata.  This legitimization strategy was crucial for gaining acceptance and consolidating power within the existing social hierarchy.  The creation of these genealogies demonstrates the power of narrative and social construction in shaping historical identities.


Statement 2 is also correct.  The Sufi movement, known for its mystical and tolerant approach, played a significant role in cultural exchange and synthesis.  Sufi saints often incorporated certain practices and rituals from Hinduism into their system, such as yogic practices, without abandoning their fundamental Islamic beliefs. This adaptability fostered a degree of religious and cultural interaction between Hindus and Muslims, contributing to a more inclusive and syncretic social environment.  The Sufi movement's emphasis on spiritual experience and personal connection facilitated this cultural blending, showcasing the potential for religious tolerance and mutual understanding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dravida style of Chola temple architecture is characterized by its multi-storied vimana rising above the garbhagriha (inner sanctum).  The text explicitly mentions that the number of stories varied from five to seven.  The description emphasizes the multiple stories as a key feature, directly contradicting statement 1.

Statement 2 is correct. The Brihadisvara Temple at Tanjore, built by Rajaraja I, is cited in the text as one of the finest and most elaborate examples of the Dravida style, showcasing its multi-storied vimana. This aligns perfectly with the description of the Dravida style's defining characteristics.  The mention of Rajaraja I's role in its construction further solidifies the accuracy of the statement.  The other options are therefore incorrect because they either include the false statement 1 or exclude the true statement 2.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Gangaikondacholapuram, the Chola capital, is now a small village near Tanjore. This directly refutes the claim that it remains a significant urban center showcasing the grandeur of Chola palaces.  The passage highlights the contrast between the past magnificence and the present-day state of the city.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly mentions that descriptions of the magnificent palaces of Chola rulers and wealthy merchants are found in the literature of the period. This indicates the existence of primary sources that detail the architectural achievements and lifestyle of the era.  The emphasis on literary sources as evidence makes statement 2 a factual assertion.  Consequently, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either falsely include statement 1 or exclude the accurate statement 2.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Hoysalesvara Temple at Halebid is explicitly mentioned in the text as a prime example of the *Chalukyan* style, not the Dravidian style.  The text carefully distinguishes between these two architectural styles, placing the Hoysalesvara Temple firmly within the Chalukyan tradition.

Statement 2 is correct. The text describes the Hoysalesvara Temple's sculptures as depicting a "busy panorama of life, including dance, music and scenes of war and love," showcasing the integration of religious and secular aspects of life. This directly supports the assertion made in statement 2.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either falsely include statement 1 or omit the accurate statement 2.


**4. With reference to the art and literature of South India (800-1200 CE), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nataraja bronze sculptures of this period are considered masterpieces, primarily found in European museums.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly praises the Nataraja bronze sculptures of this period as masterpieces and mentions that "Many fine examples of this are to be found in museums in India and abroad," indicating their presence in both Indian and international collections.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions Kamban's Ramayana as a Tamil classic and that Kamban is believed to have lived at the court of a *Chola* king, not a Pandya king.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the economic situation, particularly regarding trade and commerce, is a matter of debate among historians.  This indicates a lack of consensus on the extent of the decline, contradicting the statement's assertion of unanimous agreement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions the virtual absence of gold coins until the tenth century as a point of contention amongst historians, suggesting it as evidence supporting the claim of economic stagnation during that earlier period.  This makes statement 2 a valid point of discussion, even if the overall interpretation is debated.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either falsely include statement 1 or exclude the accurate, albeit nuanced, statement 2.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jahangir's reign is considered a golden age for Mughal painting. His discerning eye for detail and his patronage of talented artists, notably Mansur, led to significant advancements, particularly in portraiture and animal painting. Mansur's realistic and lifelike depictions of animals and birds are highly acclaimed, reflecting the refined artistic sensibilities of the time. This period saw the Mughal style develop a unique character, distinguished by its detailed realism and the use of vibrant colours.

Statement 2 is also correct. Akbar's patronage of art played a pivotal role in the development of the Mughal school of painting. By bringing together artists from diverse backgrounds, including renowned figures like Daswant and Basawan, he fostered a unique blend of Indian and Persian artistic traditions. This fusion of styles created a distinctly Mughal aesthetic that incorporated both the meticulous detail of Persian miniature painting and the expressive brushwork of Indian traditions. The incorporation of Indian themes and colours further contributed to the school's unique identity.


**3. With reference to the Rajput-Mughal relations during Akbar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's policy of matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers, exemplified by his marriage to Harkha Bai, daughter of Bharmal of Amber, was primarily driven by strategic considerations of consolidating his power and extending his influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's alliances with Rajput rulers were indeed strategic moves aimed at expanding his empire's political base and strengthening his position. Marriages with Rajput princesses, exemplified by his union with Harkha Bai, were not just personal unions but carefully calculated political strategies that brought powerful Rajput houses into his fold.  These alliances provided access to Rajput military prowess, administrative expertise, and local legitimacy, thereby facilitating the consolidation of Mughal power.  While personal relationships played a role, the primary driver was the strategic imperative of consolidating his rule over a diverse and often resistant population.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Despite Akbar's policy of religious tolerance, symbolized by the abolition of the jizya tax, Rana Pratap Singh of Mewar remained a staunch opponent of Mughal rule.  His refusal to accept Mughal suzerainty stemmed from his commitment to maintaining Mewar's independence and resisting foreign domination. This led to a protracted conflict, highlighting the limitations of Akbar's conciliatory policies in the face of determined resistance from powerful Rajput houses upholding their regional autonomy and cultural identity.  The conflict between Akbar and Rana Pratap showcased the complexities of Mughal relations with Rajput states, blending political expediency with cultural and religious differences.


**4. With reference to the economic and social life during the Chola period (800-1200 CE) in South India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola period witnessed a flourishing of temple architecture in the Dravida style, exemplified by the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, which served as not just religious centers but also as hubs of social and economic activities.
2. While the Chola rulers expanded agriculture and fostered trade, some historians debate whether this period represented a time of economic stagnation due to a relative lack of gold coinage until the 10th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chola period (800-1200 CE) is renowned for its remarkable achievements in temple architecture, particularly the Dravida style. The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur stands as a prime example of this architectural style, showcasing its grandeur and sophistication.  These temples were not merely places of worship but also served as significant social and economic hubs. They often managed vast landholdings, engaged in economic activities, and played a central role in community life.  Their economic influence stemmed from their ownership of land, their involvement in trade and commerce, and their capacity to provide social services like irrigation and welfare schemes.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Historians have differing interpretations of the Chola period's economic condition. While the Cholas undoubtedly expanded agriculture through irrigation projects and promoted extensive maritime trade, the relative scarcity of gold coinage until the 10th century has led some historians to argue for a period of economic stagnation or at least a different economic structure compared to later periods.  The absence of widespread gold coinage doesn't automatically imply economic weakness, but it does raise questions about the nature and extent of monetary transactions and the overall organization of the economy.  This debate highlights the complexities of interpreting economic indicators from historical periods and the need for nuanced analysis.


**5. With reference to the Deccan Sultanates during the 16th and 17th centuries, consider the following statements:**

The impressive acoustics within the dome further highlight the architectural ingenuity of the builders.  The Gol Gumbaz stands as a testament to the architectural achievements of the Bijapur Sultanate and its contribution to the rich architectural heritage of the Deccan.

Statement 2 is also correct. Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur earned the title "Ebla Baba" ("Friend of the Poor") due to his benevolent policies and concern for the welfare of his subjects.  He is known for his inclusive approach, patronizing both Hindu and Muslim cultures, and promoting religious tolerance.  His patronage extended to the arts, literature, and music, fostering a vibrant cultural environment in Bijapur.  His reign exemplifies the relatively tolerant and syncretic nature of some Deccan sultanates, demonstrating the potential for cultural coexistence and mutual influence in a multi-religious society.  This contrasts with the more religiously stringent policies of other contemporary rulers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Sikandar Lodi's reign represents a complex interplay of religious policy and pragmatic statecraft. Statement 1 accurately reflects this duality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 15th century in Kashmir witnessed a dramatic transformation. Statement 1 correctly describes the devastating impact of the Mongol invasion of 1320 under Dalucha. This event led to a significant decline in Hindu influence and created an environment conducive to the expansion of Islam. The massacre and enslavement further destabilized the existing social order.  Statement 2 accurately portrays the reign of Zain-ul-Abidin as a period of remarkable religious tolerance and cultural synthesis. His policies of reconciliation, restoration of temples, and patronage of both Hindu and Muslim scholars fostered a period of intellectual and artistic growth. The translation of major Sanskrit works into Persian demonstrates his commitment to bridging cultural divides.  Thus, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of Kashmir's history in the 15th century. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete because they fail to capture the significant changes and contrasting policies during the period.


**3. With reference to the cultural development in India between 1300 and 1500, consider the following statements:**

1.  The early Delhi Sultans often repurposed existing Hindu temples and structures into mosques, while also undertaking the construction of new mosques and palaces, reflecting a blend of adaptation and creation.
2.  The process of cultural assimilation between Hindus and Muslims during this period was characterized by both conflict and cooperation, with varying degrees of interaction in different regions and fields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The period between 1300 and 1500 witnessed a complex interplay of cultural forces. Statement 1 correctly highlights the architectural practices of the early Delhi Sultans.  The conversion of existing temples into mosques, as exemplified by the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, demonstrates a pragmatic approach to resource utilization, while the construction of new structures reflects their own architectural preferences and religious needs. This process was not uniform; some structures were destroyed, while others were adapted. Statement 2 accurately captures the nuanced nature of Hindu-Muslim interaction. While conflict certainly existed, there were also significant instances of cooperation and cultural exchange. The degree of interaction varied across regions and domains, illustrating the complexities of cultural synthesis.  The development of new art forms and architectural styles often incorporated elements from both traditions.  Therefore, both statements are correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to capture the dynamic and multifaceted nature of cultural development during this period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Alauddin Khalji's military campaigns were pivotal in shaping the political landscape of India. Statement 1 is accurate; his conquests of Ranthambhor and Chittor were not merely acts of military prowess but strategically crucial for controlling vital trade routes and consolidating power in Rajasthan.  The Jauhar at Ranthambhor reflects the intensity of Rajput resistance.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Malik Kafur's campaigns did extend the Delhi Sultanate's influence significantly into South India, reaching as far as Madurai, it's crucial to remember that  Malik Kafur served under Alauddin Khalji, not a Mughal emperor.  The Mughal empire emerged later. The campaigns were carried out under the Delhi Sultanate, not the Mughal empire.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is entirely correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccurate attribution of Malik Kafur's campaigns to the Mughal empire.


**5. With reference to the economic and social life of India in the early 17th century, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers' accounts consistently depict a stark contrast between the opulence of the ruling classes and the widespread poverty among peasants and laborers, highlighting significant social and economic disparities.

Statement 1 accurately reflects the observations made by European travelers who documented the significant disparity between the lifestyles of the elite and the common people. The accounts highlight the pervasive poverty, inadequate clothing, and limited access to resources among the majority of the population. This disparity underscores the unequal distribution of wealth and resources. Statement 2 is also correct in its assessment of the Indian peasantry.  Despite facing frequent famines and high taxes, Indian cultivators displayed remarkable adaptability by integrating new crops like tobacco and maize into their agricultural practices. This demonstrates their entrepreneurial spirit and ability to respond to market demands.  Their agricultural production played a vital role in feeding the growing urban centers and supporting exports of food grains.  Therefore, both statements offer accurate insights into the economic and social realities of the time. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete because they fail to capture the complexity of the situation.

Ibrahim Adil Shah II's reign, in particular, was marked by religious tolerance and a flourishing of the arts. His patronage extended to both Hindu and Muslim religious traditions, reflecting a spirit of inclusivity. His contributions to music and literature are well documented. Statement 2 is also correct; Golconda fostered a rich cultural environment. The development of Dakhini Urdu as a distinct literary form is a testament to its linguistic dynamism.  The Charminar, a magnificent architectural landmark, exemplifies Golconda's artistic achievements.  The patronage of poets and artists, and the development of a unique literary style, highlight the state's commitment to the arts.  Both statements correctly highlight significant aspects of the Deccan's cultural heritage. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to fully represent the rich cultural output of these kingdoms.


**7. With reference to Aurangzeb's reign and the movements for regional independence, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jat uprisings, primarily agrarian in nature, were driven by issues related to land revenue and combined peasant resistance with elements of guerrilla warfare.
2.  The Afghan uprisings, characterized by tribal dynamics and a desire for regional autonomy, were significantly influenced by religious revivalist movements like the Raushanai.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aurangzeb's reign saw several challenges to Mughal authority. Statement 1 accurately depicts the Jat uprisings.  These were largely agrarian in origin, stemming from disputes over land revenue and the oppressive policies of the Mughal administration. The Jats employed guerilla warfare tactics, effectively utilizing their knowledge of the terrain. Statement 2 is equally accurate. The Afghan uprisings were complex, involving tribal rivalries and aspirations for regional independence.  However,  religious revivalist movements, such as the Raushanai, played a vital role in shaping the ideological underpinnings of these uprisings, adding a religious dimension to the political conflict.  The Raushanai movement's emphasis on ethical conduct and devotion resonated with many Afghans, strengthening their resolve. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the nature and causes of these major challenges to Aurangzeb's rule. Options (a), (b), and (d) provide an incomplete picture of the historical context.

1.  The Dravida style, characterized by multi-storied vimanas above the garbhagriha and pillared mandapas, reached its zenith during the Chola period.
2.  Chola temples often incorporated images of kings and queens within their courtyards, reflecting the close relationship between the rulers and the religious institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Chola temple architecture represents a high point in South Indian art. Statement 1 accurately describes the Dravida style, which indeed flourished under the Cholas.  The distinctive multi-storied vimanas, towering above the sanctum sanctorum, and the large pillared mandapas, serving as gathering spaces, are hallmarks of this architectural style.  The evolution of the gopurams, the monumental gateways, further enhanced the grandeur of these structures. Statement 2 is also correct. The inclusion of royal imagery within temple courtyards reflects the close ties between the Chola rulers and the religious establishment.  This practice symbolized the rulers' piety and their role as patrons of religious institutions. It also served as a means of propagating royal power and legitimacy. The integration of royal imagery into the temples served a dual purpose—religious and political.  Both statements are accurate and reflect important characteristics of Chola temple architecture.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and do not capture the full picture of this distinct architectural style and its socio-political context.

1.  The period witnessed the expansion of agriculture, often facilitated by royal initiatives in building irrigation infrastructure, leading to the settlement of nomadic and semi-nomadic groups.
2.  While some historians debate the extent of economic growth, the emergence of regional kingdoms and the strengthening of local elites suggest a period of both continuity and change in economic and social structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The period from 800 to 1200 CE in India was marked by significant changes. Statement 1 accurately reflects the expansion of agriculture during this period. Many regional kingdoms invested in irrigation projects, such as building bunds and wells, to improve agricultural productivity. This led to the settlement of previously nomadic or semi-nomadic communities, transforming the demographics and economic activities in many areas.  This process was not uniform across India but was a significant factor in the growth of many regions. Statement 2 correctly addresses the ongoing debates among historians regarding the overall economic growth during this era. While the exact extent of economic expansion is still subject to scholarly discussion, the emergence of powerful regional kingdoms and the consolidation of local elites indicate a significant transformation in the economic and social structures.  These changes were not uniform; some regions saw greater economic dynamism than others.  However, the period clearly saw both continuity and change. Therefore, both statements capture crucial aspects of the economic and social developments during this period. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete because they fail to represent the complexities of this era.


**10. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate and its impact on town life, consider the following statements:**

The establishment of military bases created a significant demand for goods and services, stimulating economic activity and leading to the development of urban centers around these garrisons.  This created a symbiotic relationship between military presence and economic growth. Statement 2 also accurately describes the diverse nature of the urban population. Towns under the Delhi Sultanate were home to a wide range of individuals, including slaves, artisans, merchants, and government officials.  The economic conditions and social standing of these groups varied significantly, resulting in a complex social hierarchy. The presence of a large slave population was a characteristic of many medieval societies, including the Delhi Sultanate.  Therefore, both statements provide accurate insights into the urban dynamics during the Delhi Sultanate. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to capture the complexities of urban life during this period.


**1. With reference to Mughal architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri, built by Akbar, incorporated various types of pillars used in different temples, supporting flat roofs, reflecting a blend of architectural styles.
2.  Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram is considered a culmination of pre-Mughal architecture and a starting point for the new Mughal style, showcasing architectural marvels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri, a palace-cum-fort complex commissioned by Akbar, is a unique structure.  Its design incorporated various pillar styles from different Indian temples, supporting its flat roofs. This exemplifies Akbar's interest in blending architectural traditions and his patronage of diverse styles.  The use of different pillar styles within a single structure showcases a departure from purely Persian or Central Asian influences and a conscious effort to integrate indigenous elements. This architectural innovation is a significant aspect of Akbar's reign and his broader approach to cultural synthesis.

Statement 2 is also correct. Sher Shah Suri's mausoleum at Sasaram is widely recognized as an architectural masterpiece. Its design is considered a culmination of pre-Mughal architectural styles, particularly in its elegant use of materials and proportions.  It also represents a significant transitional phase, forming the bridge between earlier architectural trends and the subsequently flourishing Mughal style. Historians often cite it as a crucial link, demonstrating the evolution of architectural forms and the influence of pre-Mughal styles on the later Mughal imperial architecture.  The combination of these factors makes it a crucial landmark in the history of Indian architecture.


**2. With reference to Mughal Gardens, consider the following statements:**

1.  Babur, known for his love of gardens, laid out several gardens near Agra and Lahore, showcasing the early Mughal interest in landscape design and the integration of water features.
2.  The Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir, and the Pinjore Gardens in the Punjab foothills, are examples of Mughal gardens that have survived to this day, illustrating the enduring legacy of Mughal landscape architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Babur's fondness for gardens is well documented. He established several gardens near Agra and Lahore, reflecting the early Mughal emphasis on landscape design and the incorporation of water features into garden layouts. This reflects a preference for planned, formal gardens, contrasting with some indigenous styles. This early introduction of a distinct Mughal garden aesthetic laid the groundwork for the more elaborate gardens developed by later Mughal emperors. The use of running water, a distinctive feature of Mughal gardens, was already established during Babur’s time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Shalimar Gardens are indeed a significant example of Mughal garden design, they are located in Lahore, not Kashmir. The Nishat Bagh is located in Kashmir.  The Pinjore Gardens are in the Punjab foothills, as stated, but the description conflates the location of gardens. The mention of two gardens, one incorrectly placed, introduces a distractor and makes the statement factually inaccurate.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**3. With reference to Mughal painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Akbar's patronage, a painting workshop was established, drawing painters from various castes and religions, leading to a unique blend of Indian and Persian styles.
2.  Jahangir, known for his discerning eye, is credited with the development of portrait painting and animal paintings in the Mughal school, with Mansur being a prominent figure in this area.

This fostered the integration of Indian themes, colors, and artistic sensibilities with the existing Persian style, resulting in a unique and innovative artistic tradition. The collaboration between artists of different backgrounds was instrumental in creating a distinctive Mughal painting style. This integration of diverse artistic traditions is a key characteristic of Mughal art under Akbar.

Statement 2 is also correct. Jahangir's patronage greatly influenced the evolution of Mughal painting. He possessed a keen aesthetic sense and actively promoted the development of portraiture and animal painting, with Mansur emerging as a master artist in this field. Jahangir's personal interest and refined taste contributed to a high level of detail and realism in Mughal paintings.  The emphasis on realism and detailed depiction of subjects, particularly in portraits and animal studies, is a defining characteristic of Mughal painting during Jahangir's reign.  Mansur's exceptional skill in capturing the likeness of animals and humans further elevated the status of these genres within the Mughal artistic tradition.


**4.  With reference to the reign of Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aurangzeb, despite his reputation for religious orthodoxy, issued secular decrees (zawabits) that sometimes modified the Sharia in response to the practical needs of governance in India's diverse society.
2.  Aurangzeb's religious policies, including the re-imposition of the jizya tax and the demolition of some Hindu temples, are seen by some historians as undermining the loyalty of Hindus to the empire, contributing to its eventual decline.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aurangzeb, while known for his strict adherence to Islamic principles, was also a pragmatic ruler.  He issued numerous secular decrees, known as zawabits, which often modified or supplemented the Sharia to address the complexities of governing a vast and diverse empire like India. This demonstrates his ability to balance religious conviction with the practical demands of administration.  The existence of a separate body of secular decrees highlights the nuanced approach of Aurangzeb towards governance. The zawabits showcase a complex interplay between religious law and secular rule, reflecting the realities of the Mughal Empire.

Statement 2 is also correct. A significant aspect of Aurangzeb's reign was his religious policies.  The re-imposition of the jizya tax on non-Muslims and the destruction of some Hindu temples are widely documented events.  Many historians interpret these actions as contributing to the alienation of the Hindu population and weakening the loyalty of powerful Hindu rulers within the empire. These actions, along with other policies, are considered by some historians as contributing factors to the decline of the Mughal Empire.  The debate surrounding Aurangzeb's religious policies and their impact on the stability of the empire continues to be a significant area of historical discussion.


**5. With reference to the Rajput policy of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's Rajput policy involved matrimonial alliances, granting religious freedom to his Hindu wives, and elevating Rajput families to positions of prominence within the Mughal nobility.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's approach to the Rajputs was a key element of his imperial strategy.  He strategically formed matrimonial alliances with Rajput rulers, most notably with the Kachwahas of Amber.  Furthermore, he granted religious freedom to his Rajput wives and promoted their families to significant positions within the Mughal nobility. This policy aimed to integrate the powerful Rajput clans into the Mughal structure, fostering loyalty and stability.  The elevation of Rajput families to high offices demonstrates Akbar's pragmatic approach to building alliances and consolidating his power.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Akbar's policy of religious tolerance is well-known.  A significant aspect of this policy was the abolition of the jizya tax, a tax levied on non-Muslims. This act signaled a departure from the discriminatory practices of previous rulers and aimed to foster a sense of inclusivity and shared loyalty among his diverse subjects.  The abolition of the jizya tax is seen as a pragmatic move to consolidate the empire and reduce potential conflicts arising from religious differences.  This policy exemplifies Akbar's broader approach to religious syncretism and his efforts to create a more unified and harmonious empire.


**6. With reference to the Delhi Sultanate architecture, consider the following statements:**

The mosque was originally built by incorporating materials and elements from a pre-existing Hindu temple.  This repurposing of existing structures is common in the early stages of the Sultanate's architectural development.  This initial phase demonstrates a pragmatic approach to construction, using available resources and adapting pre-existing structures. This early integration of existing elements with new Islamic architectural styles laid the foundation for a distinct Indo-Islamic architectural tradition.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Alai Darwaza, a gateway to the Qutab Minar complex, is a significant example of architectural innovation during the Khalji period.  Its design, characterized by well-proportioned arches and a dome built on sound scientific principles, showcases the growing mastery of architectural techniques by Indian craftsmen working within the Sultanate. This demonstrates the significant development of architectural skills under the patronage of the Sultanate.  The Alai Darwaza represents a high point of architectural achievement during the Khalji period and exemplifies the integration of architectural techniques with artistic designs.


**7. With reference to the Chola temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, built by Rajaraja I, is a prime example of the Dravida style, showcasing its elaborate structure, including a pillared mandap (hall), and towering gopurams (gateways).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dravida style of temple architecture, prominent during the Chola period in South India, is characterized by its multi-storied vimanas rising above the garbhagriha. This distinctive architectural feature is a defining characteristic of Chola temples. The multiple storeys of the vimana represent a significant architectural achievement, showcasing the technical skills of the builders.  The vimana's design played a key role in establishing a distinct South Indian architectural style.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, built by Rajaraja I, is considered a masterpiece of Chola architecture and a prime example of the Dravida style.  Its design incorporates all the key features of the Dravida style, including the towering vimana, a large pillared mandap, and impressive gopurams.  The scale and grandeur of the Brihadisvara Temple reflect the power and wealth of the Chola empire.  The temple's enduring presence is a testament to the architectural achievements of the Chola period.  Its intricate carvings, monumental scale, and sophisticated design establish its significance in the history of Indian temple architecture.


**8. With reference to the economic and social life of India between 800-1200 CE, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline of the Roman Empire did not significantly impact India's trade with the West, as the Byzantine and Sassanid empires emerged as important trading partners, maintaining connections with India and the Indian Ocean region.
2.  The expansion of agriculture during this period, often facilitated by rulers constructing irrigation systems, led to the growth of small towns catering to local trade, alongside an increase in regional self-sufficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the fall of the Roman Empire marked a significant change in the Western world, its impact on India's trade with the West was relatively limited. This is because new major powers emerged, such as the Byzantine and Sassanid empires, that maintained and even expanded trade connections with India and the Indian Ocean region.  These empires actively participated in trade networks, ensuring the continued flow of goods and resources between India and the West.  The continuity of these trade relationships demonstrates the resilience of India's economic connections with the West despite significant political changes in Europe.

Statement 2 is also correct. The period between 800-1200 CE witnessed a notable expansion of agriculture in various parts of India.  Rulers of different kingdoms played an active role in this expansion, often by undertaking large-scale irrigation projects, constructing canals, wells, and tanks. This led to the development of new settlements and the growth of small towns, primarily focused on local trade.  The increase in agricultural output also promoted regional self-sufficiency, although long-distance trade continued to be important. The interplay between agricultural expansion, local trade, and regional self-sufficiency represents a significant aspect of economic and social life during this period.


**1. With reference to the administrative structure of the Pala and Pratihara empires, consider the following statements:**

1. The *uparika* was the governor of a province (*akta*), responsible for collecting land revenue and maintaining law and order.
2.  The *visayapati* headed a *mandala* or *visaya* (district), and their role was primarily focused on land revenue collection and local law and order, with less emphasis on broader provincial administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the administrative structure of the Pala and Pratihara empires. The *uparika* was indeed the provincial governor, holding significant authority over revenue collection and maintaining law and order within their respective provinces (*akta*).  The *visayapati*, as the district head, also played a crucial role in revenue collection and local administration, ensuring the smooth functioning of their *mandala* or *visaya*. While the *uparika* had a broader scope of responsibility encompassing the entire province, the *visayapati*'s focus was more localized.  The text clearly outlines the responsibilities of both officials, making both statements factually correct.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they present only one aspect of a dual administrative structure. Option (d) is also incorrect as both statements are supported by the provided text.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the hierarchical administrative system prevalent in these ancient Indian empires.


**2. With reference to the military organization of the Rashtrakutas and Palas, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rashtrakutas, unlike the Palas, possessed a significant naval force, details of which are well documented in contemporary sources.
2. Both the Pala and Rashtrakuta armies consisted of regular and irregular infantry, supplemented by levies from vassal chiefs, with the regular troops often hereditary and drawn from diverse regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions that the Palas *and perhaps the Rashtrakutas* had navies, it also states that "we do not know much about their strength and organization." This lack of detailed information makes a definitive statement about the comparative strength of their naval forces impossible.  Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly describes the composition of both the Pala and Rashtrakuta armies, including regular and irregular infantry, levies from vassal chiefs, and hereditary soldiers from various parts of India.  This demonstrates a shared military organizational pattern. Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect due to the uncertainty surrounding the relative naval strengths of the two empires and the clear evidence supporting the composition of their land forces. This question evaluates the candidate's ability to analyze information presented and differentiate between conclusive and inconclusive statements, testing analytical skills and factual recall.


**3. With reference to the relationship between the overlords and vassal chiefs in the Pala and Pratihara empires, consider the following statements:**

1. Vassal chiefs were completely autonomous in their internal affairs, paying only symbolic tribute and providing minimal military support to their overlords.
2.  Vassal chiefs were frequently at odds with their overlords, often aspiring for independence, leading to frequent conflicts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions vassal chiefs had autonomy in internal affairs, it clarifies that their obligation included paying a *fixed tribute* and supplying a *quota of troops*. This indicates a more substantial level of obligation than described in the statement. Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that vassal chiefs "always aspired to be independent and wars between them and the overlord were frequent," providing clear evidence of the contentious relationship. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statement 1 and the clear support for statement 2.  This question tests the ability to critically evaluate information, distinguishing between the actual nature of the relationship and a potentially misleading simplification, assessing analytical and factual recall skills.


**4. With reference to the territorial divisions in the Rashtrakuta kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. The *rashra* was the smallest administrative unit, below the *visaya* and *bhukti*, primarily concerned with local revenue collection.
2. The *rashra* was a province, headed by a *rashṭrapaṭi*, who performed functions similar to the *uparika* in the Pala and Pratihara empires.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Rashtrakuta kingdom's directly administered areas were divided into *rashṭra* (provinces), *visayas*, and *bhuktis*, with *bhukti* being a smaller unit than *visaya*. This reverses the order presented in statement 1. Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly describes the *rashṭra* as a province, headed by a *rashṭrapaṭi*, whose responsibilities mirrored those of the *uparika* in other empires. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the hierarchical structure of the Rashtrakuta administration and fail to accurately describe the role of the *rashṭrapaṭi*. This question assesses the candidate's ability to interpret hierarchical information and understand the similarities and differences in administrative structures across different empires, testing conceptual understanding and factual recall.


**5. With reference to village administration during the period of the Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta empires, consider the following statements:**

1. Village headmen and accountants held their positions through hereditary succession and were compensated through grants of rent-free land.
2. Village committees, particularly in Karnataka, managed local schools, tanks, temples, and roads, often working in cooperation with the headman and receiving a share of revenue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of village administration during the specified period. The text explicitly mentions that village headmen and accountants held hereditary positions and received rent-free land as compensation.  Furthermore, the text details the existence of village committees in the Rashtrakuta kingdom, particularly in Karnataka, responsible for managing various local affairs and receiving a percentage of revenue. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they only partially represent the detailed structure of village administration described in the text. This question tests factual recall and understanding of local governance structures in ancient India, focusing on the decentralized nature of administration and the significant role of hereditary officials and community participation.


**6. With reference to the socio-political impact of the Brahman-Rajput alliance, consider the following statements:**

1. The alliance resulted in the Rajputs adopting Buddhism and Jainism, leading to a decline in the construction of Hindu temples.
2. The Rajputs, acting as champions of expansionist Hinduism, demonstrated their power through the construction of grand temples and endowments to Brahman priests.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the Brahman-Rajput alliance had consequences for the *newly expansionist Hinduism*, indicating a strengthening, not a decline, of Hindu influence.  The alliance did not lead to the adoption of Buddhism or Jainism by Rajputs; rather, it reinforced Hindu power. Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly describes the Rajputs' role as champions of expansionist Hinduism, building grand temples and making large land grants to Brahman priests as a display of power. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the misrepresentation of religious shifts and the accurate depiction of the alliance's impact on temple construction and religious patronage.  This question assesses the candidate's ability to interpret historical alliances and their impact on religious and political landscapes, testing analytical and factual recall skills.


**7. With reference to the social mobility within the caste system during the period discussed, consider the following statements:**

1. The caste system was strictly rigid, with individuals and groups unable to change their social standing.
2.  The Kayastha caste emerged as a distinct group, seemingly incorporating individuals from various castes who worked in royal establishments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly refutes the idea of a strictly rigid caste system, stating that "individuals and groups could rise in the varna scale, and they could also fall." This shows a degree of fluidity within the system. Statement 2 is correct. The passage describes the emergence of the Kayastha caste as a result of individuals from different castes working in royal establishments, eventually forming a distinct group. Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect due to the misrepresentation of social mobility within the caste system and the accurate description of the Kayastha caste's origin. This question assesses the candidate's ability to understand the complexities of the caste system and its nuances, highlighting the possibility of social fluidity, and testing conceptual understanding and factual recall.


**8. With reference to the condition of women during the period, consider the following statements:**

1. Women were universally considered mentally inferior and denied all opportunities for education and social advancement.
2. While women were generally considered subordinate to men, some held positions of power, such as ruling queens in Orissa and Kashmir.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the text mentions that women were generally considered mentally inferior and their access to Vedic education was limited, it also highlights exceptions.  The text points to skilled women in various arts and even mentions women rulers, contradicting the idea of complete denial of opportunities. Statement 2 is correct. The passage specifically cites examples of women rulers in Orissa and Kashmir, demonstrating that while women faced societal limitations, some achieved positions of significant power. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because of the inaccurate generalization in statement 1 and the clear evidence supporting statement 2's acknowledgement of exceptions to the general condition of women. This question tests the ability to interpret historical accounts, recognizing the existence of both limitations and exceptions to generalized statements, assessing analytical and factual recall skills.


**9. With reference to the economic conditions of artisans and workers in towns during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Artisans and workers enjoyed a high standard of living, with wages exceeding the cost of living, even during periods of economic hardship.
2.  There were significant economic inequalities within medieval society, with the Muslim nobility and wealthy merchants leading ostentatious lives while the majority lived simply and faced hardships.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions the "hard" living conditions of artisans and workers, with low wages barely sufficient for survival. This contradicts the claim of a high standard of living. Statement 2 is correct. The passage highlights the significant economic disparities between the ruling classes (Muslim nobility and wealthy merchants) and the majority of the population, who lived simple lives and often faced hardships. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1 and the explicit evidence supporting statement 2. This question assesses the candidate's ability to understand economic stratification and the contrast between the lives of different social groups, testing factual recall and analytical skills.


**10. With reference to the religious policies of the rulers during the period, consider the following statements:**

1. Rulers generally persecuted those who did not follow the dominant religion of the empire, enforcing religious uniformity.
2.  While many rulers were devout followers of specific faiths, they generally patronized various religions and did not persecute individuals for their beliefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that rulers generally gave "patronage to all the faiths, and did not persecute anyone for his or her religious beliefs." This contradicts the claim of religious persecution and enforcement of uniformity. Statement 2 is correct. The passage describes the rulers' religious tolerance, acknowledging their personal faith while highlighting their patronage of diverse religious practices. Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect due to the misrepresentation of religious policies and the clear support for statement 2. This question tests the candidate's understanding of religious tolerance and state policies toward different religious communities during the medieval period, assessing factual recall and conceptual understanding.

2. Jainism, while maintaining popularity among trading communities and enjoying royal patronage (as seen with the Chalukyas), experienced a decline due to growing internal rigidity and the loss of royal support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text addresses the decline of Buddhism and Jainism. Statement 1 correctly identifies internal factors in Buddhism's decline, such as the adoption of elaborate rituals and magical practices, leading to a syncretism with Hinduism. Statement 2 accurately describes Jainism's decline, referencing its continued popularity among certain communities and past royal support, but also highlighting its growing rigidity and eventual loss of patronage as factors in its decline.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; the passage supports both statements as contributing factors to the decline of these religions.

This supports the accuracy of statement 1. The text also explicitly mentions that before the Turkish rule, regional languages like Tamil, Kannada, and Marathi were used for administrative purposes in various kingdoms. This substantiates statement 2.  Therefore, both statements correctly describe factors contributing to the development of regional languages during the medieval period. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to consider the validity of both statements.


**3. With reference to the musical developments during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar patronized Tansen, who is credited with composing numerous new ragas, a tradition continued by subsequent Mughal rulers.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage details Babur's military tactics at Panipat, emphasizing his skillful use of artillery and flanking maneuvers that significantly contributed to his victory and marked a shift in Indian warfare.  This validates statement 1.  The passage also explains Babur's motivations for conquering India, highlighting the limited resources of his existing territories (Kabul, Kandahar) and the lure of India's wealth as key factors. This substantiates statement 2.  Therefore, both statements correctly describe aspects of Babur's political and military strategies. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the validity of both statements.


**6. With reference to the religious policies of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar abolished the jizya tax and pilgrim tax, demonstrating his commitment to religious tolerance and equality among his subjects.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, established by Akbar, initially focused on discussions among Muslim theologians but later expanded to include people of all faiths.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax (poll tax on non-Muslims) and pilgrim tax, illustrating his policy of religious tolerance and equal rights for all citizens. This makes statement 1 correct. The passage also describes the evolution of the Ibadat Khana, starting with discussions among Muslim theologians and subsequently opening its doors to representatives of all religions. This confirms statement 2. Thus, both statements accurately reflect elements of Akbar's religious policies. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to account for the accuracy of both statements.


**7. With reference to the composition of the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1.  While Rajputs formed a significant portion of the Mughal nobility, particularly under Akbar, the proportion of Hindus in the nobility remained relatively low throughout the Mughal period.
2.  The Mughal nobility was a diverse group, encompassing various ethnicities and religions, and individuals from humble backgrounds could rise to positions of influence.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Although Rajputs were prominent, the passage shows the Mughal nobility was diverse, including Afghans, Indian Muslims, and Hindus in increasing numbers over time. This contradicts statement 1's claim of consistently low Hindu representation. However, statement 2 accurately reflects the nobility's diverse composition and the possibility of social mobility, with individuals from humble origins achieving high positions.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misinterpret the complex composition of the Mughal nobility.


**8. Consider the following statements about the cultural interactions during the medieval period:**

1.  The Persian language became the language of administration and the upper classes, facilitating cultural exchange between India and Central Asia.
2.  Sanskrit literature largely ignored the presence of Muslims in India, with minimal attempts at translating Islamic works or Persian literature into Sanskrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage describes how Persian became a crucial link language in administration and among the upper classes, fostering cultural connections between India and Central Asia and Iran.  This makes statement 1 correct.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While the passage notes that Sanskrit literature largely ignored the presence of Muslims, it also mentions some exceptions, such as the translation of the Yusuf and Zulaikha story and works on the astrolabe.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the role of Persian or fail to recognize the limited nature of Sanskrit-Persian translation efforts.


**9. With reference to the political situation in North India leading to Babur's invasion, consider the following statements:**

1.  The death of Sikandar Lodi and the succession of Ibrahim Lodi created instability within the Delhi Sultanate, weakening its resistance to external threats.
2.  Daulat Khan Lodi, the governor of Punjab, initially invited Babur to India to overthrow Ibrahim Lodi, but later changed his allegiance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage notes that Ibrahim Lodi's rule, following Sikandar Lodi's death, was marked by instability and a lack of support from Afghan chiefs and Rajputs, making the Delhi Sultanate vulnerable to invasion. This supports statement 1.  The passage also describes Daulat Khan Lodi's initial invitation to Babur and subsequent shift in allegiance, demonstrating his opportunistic approach to politics. This makes statement 2 accurate. Therefore, both statements correctly reflect the political context preceding Babur's invasion. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements in describing the political landscape before Babur's arrival.


**10.  With reference to the religious and social movements of the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sikh movement, originating with Nanak, saw a shift towards a more aristocratic lifestyle under Guru Arjun Dev, who collected offerings from Sikhs.
2.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a leading figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement, opposed Akbar's liberal policies and advocated for a stricter interpretation of Islam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage describes Guru Arjun Dev's adoption of a more aristocratic lifestyle and the implementation of a system of collecting offerings to support the Sikh movement. This supports statement 1.  The passage also highlights Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's opposition to Akbar's liberal policies and his advocacy for a more orthodox interpretation of Islam, confirming statement 2.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Sikh and orthodox Muslim movements during the medieval period. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to account for the validity of both statements.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the literary and cultural landscape of the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1. Abul Fazl's prose style significantly influenced subsequent generations of writers, while his brother Faizi oversaw the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian.
2.  The Mughal court attracted numerous Persian poets and scholars, including Utbi and Naziri, who migrated from Iran, enriching the cultural milieu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Abul Fazl, a renowned scholar and stylist, established a distinctive prose style that became a model for many generations of writers. His brother, Faizi, also a prominent figure, played a crucial role in Akbar's translation department and supervised the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian.  This highlights the Mughal emperors' patronage of both Persian and Indian literary traditions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Mughal court became a significant center for Persian literature and scholarship, attracting numerous poets and scholars from Iran. Utbi and Naziri, though Persian in origin, are cited as examples of this cultural exchange and the enrichment it brought to the Mughal court, transforming it into a major cultural hub of the Islamic world.  This illustrates the cosmopolitan nature of the Mughal empire and its ability to attract and integrate diverse talents.  The migration of these scholars showcases the allure of the Mughal court as a center of learning and patronage.


**2. With reference to the development of regional languages during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1. The rise of regional languages was facilitated by the declining prestige of Sanskrit and the use of vernacular languages by Bhakti saints.
2.  The Mughal emperors actively discouraged the use of regional languages in administration and literature, preferring Persian.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The decline in Sanskrit's prestige, possibly due to the diminishing influence of Brahmins, and the adoption of regional languages by Bhakti saints played significant roles in the rise of vernacular literatures.  The Bhakti movement's use of accessible languages fostered wider participation and dissemination of religious and literary ideas, giving a boost to regional languages.  This demonstrates the interplay between religious movements and linguistic development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Persian remained the language of administration and the court, the Mughal period witnessed a significant flourishing of regional languages in literature.  Several Mughal rulers even patronized translations into and literary works in regional languages, demonstrating a more nuanced and complex linguistic policy than simply suppressing vernaculars.  The examples of translations of the Mahabharata and Ramayana into regional languages, and the rise of poets like Alaol in Bengali, contradict the assertion of outright discouragement.


**3. With reference to the impact of the Bhakti movement on the religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on reforming Hindu rituals and practices, with limited interaction with Sufi traditions.
2.  Kabir and Nanak, while critical of existing social structures, were primarily concerned with individual spiritual reform rather than large-scale social change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Bhakti movement, while deeply rooted in Hindu traditions, engaged significantly with Sufi traditions.  The shared emphasis on devotion, monism, and a direct path to God fostered significant interaction and cross-pollination of ideas between Bhakti and Sufi saints.  The examples of Sufi saints writing in Hindi and incorporating Bhakti themes into their works demonstrate this exchange.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  Kabir and Nanak, though critical of the caste system and societal inequalities, focused primarily on individual spiritual transformation.  While their teachings implicitly challenged social hierarchies, their main emphasis was on personal piety, devotion to a single God, and the rejection of ritualistic practices.  Their humanistic approach sought individual reform as a path to broader societal change, rather than direct social activism.  Their impact on subsequent religious and social reform movements, however, was undeniably significant.


**4.  With reference to the religious policies of Mughal emperors, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's policy of *sulh-i-kul* (universal peace) aimed at promoting religious tolerance and harmony, incorporating elements of both Hindu and Islamic traditions.
2. Aurangzeb's reign witnessed a marked shift towards religious orthodoxy, characterized by the re-imposition of the *jizya* tax and the destruction of some temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Akbar's policy of *sulh-i-kul* aimed at establishing religious harmony and tolerance.  He actively engaged with religious leaders from various faiths, promoted interfaith dialogues, and even attempted to synthesize religious beliefs.  This policy reflects a unique approach to governance, aiming to create a more inclusive and peaceful society.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Aurangzeb's reign marked a departure from the comparatively tolerant policies of earlier Mughal emperors. He re-imposed the *jizya* tax, a poll tax on non-Muslims, and ordered the destruction of some Hindu temples.  These actions are viewed as reflecting a more orthodox and less inclusive approach to governance.  However, it's important to note that even during Aurangzeb's reign, religious tolerance wasn't completely absent, and regional variations existed.  The complexity of Aurangzeb's religious policies requires careful analysis, avoiding generalizations.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the contributions of various figures to Persian and Sanskrit literature during the medieval period:**

1. Amir Khusrau, known for his contributions to Persian literature, also showed an appreciation for Indian languages and incorporated elements of the Hindi style into his Persian writing.
2.  The translation of Sanskrit works into Persian, and vice-versa, was largely a one-way street, with little translation from Persian to Sanskrit occurring during this period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Amir Khusrau, a prominent figure in medieval Persian literature, is noted for his appreciation of Indian languages and his unique style of Persian writing, incorporating elements of Hindi.  This demonstrates the cross-pollination of literary styles and the interaction between Persian and regional languages. His work exemplifies the cultural synthesis of the period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the translation of Sanskrit works into Persian was more prominent, there was some reciprocal translation from Persian to Sanskrit, though perhaps less extensive.  The translation of works on topics like astronomy, medicine, and even love stories (like *Yusuf and Zulaikha*) into Sanskrit demonstrates that the flow of knowledge wasn't entirely unidirectional.  The limited extent of Persian to Sanskrit translation should not be interpreted as a complete absence of such activity.


**6. With reference to the musical traditions of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's patronage of Tansen, a renowned musician from Gwalior, led to the development of new musical melodies (ragas) and enriched the musical landscape.
2. Aurangzeb's religious conservatism resulted in a complete suppression of music in all forms throughout his reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's patronage of Tansen, a celebrated musician from Gwalior, significantly contributed to the development of new ragas and the overall enrichment of Indian classical music.  This highlights the importance of royal patronage in shaping artistic traditions.  The mention of Tansen's contributions in the text supports this statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb's personal preferences leaned towards religious orthodoxy, and he did ban singing in his court,  music in various forms continued to flourish under the patronage of his queens, princes, and nobles.  The continued production of books on classical Indian music during his reign contradicts the notion of a complete suppression of musical traditions. The statement oversimplifies a complex historical reality.


**7. With reference to the political and social dynamics of the early Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1. Babur's victory at the Battle of Panipat (1526) marked the beginning of Mughal rule in India, significantly altering the existing political landscape.
2. The Battle of Khanwa (1527) solidified Babur's control over the Delhi-Agra region, despite facing strong resistance from a Rajput confederacy led by Rana Sanga.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Babur's decisive victory at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 against Ibrahim Lodi, the last Sultan of Delhi, marked the beginning of Mughal rule in India, initiating a new era in Indian history. This victory dramatically shifted the political balance of power in North India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Battle of Khanwa in 1527, though fiercely contested by Rana Sanga and his Rajput confederacy, resulted in another significant Mughal victory.  This further cemented Babur's control over the crucial Delhi-Agra region, establishing the foundation for the Mughal Empire's expansion.  The battle highlights Babur's military prowess and the challenges he faced in consolidating his rule.


**8. With reference to the religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sikh movement, originating with the teachings of Guru Nanak, initially emphasized quiet meditation and scholarship before evolving into a more organized religious and political entity.
2.  The Maharashtra Dharma, a religious and social reform movement, primarily focused on the worship of Vithoba, a form of Vishnu, and challenged traditional Brahmanical authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Sikh movement, founded by Guru Nanak, initially focused on spiritual practices like meditation and scholarship. However, under subsequent Gurus, particularly Guru Arjun Dev, it evolved into a more structured religious and political force, with the compilation of the Adi Granth and the establishment of Amritsar as a significant center.  This evolution demonstrates the complex interplay of religious and political factors in the movement's development.

Statement 2 is also accurate. The Maharashtra Dharma, centered in Pandharpur, focused on the worship of Vithoba and actively challenged the traditional Brahmanical dominance in religious and social spheres.  The emphasis on egalitarianism and the participation of people from lower castes highlight the movement's significance as a social reform movement.  Tukaram's contributions are cited as examples of this challenge to traditional hierarchies.


**9. With reference to the administrative and cultural policies of the later Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sikandar Lodi's reign witnessed the selection of Agra as a strategic location for a new city, due to its command over the eastern Rajasthan and the route to Malwa and Gujarat.
2. Zain-ul-Abidin's rule in Kashmir was characterized by religious tolerance, the restoration of Hindu temples, and the patronage of both Persian and Sanskrit scholarship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sikandar Lodi's choice of Agra as a new city was a strategic move, reflecting his interest in controlling eastern Rajasthan and securing trade routes to Malwa and Gujarat. This decision highlights the Sultanate's expansionist ambitions and their understanding of geographical and economic importance.

Statement 2 is also correct. Zain-ul-Abidin's reign in Kashmir is characterized by a remarkable degree of religious tolerance and a conscious effort to reconcile different religious communities. His policies involved the restoration of Hindu temples, the cancellation of anti-Hindu decrees, and the patronage of both Persian and Sanskrit scholars.  His reign showcases a more inclusive approach to governance.  The translation of the *Rajatarangini* into Persian under his patronage further exemplifies this cultural integration.


**10. With reference to the Jat and Sikh movements in the context of the declining Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat movement, initially a peasant uprising against Mughal land revenue policies, eventually led to the establishment of a separate Jat principality.
2.  The Sikh movement's conflicts with the Mughal emperors were primarily driven by religious differences and a desire to establish a separate theocratic state.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jat movement, initially fueled by peasant grievances over land revenue and other injustices, evolved into a powerful political force.  Under leaders like Churaman, the Jats successfully established an independent principality, demonstrating the ability of a regional movement to challenge and overcome Mughal authority.  This illustrates the complex interaction of agrarian unrest and political ambition.

Statement 2 is an oversimplification. While religious factors played a role in the Sikh movement's conflicts with the Mughals, the conflicts were not solely driven by religious differences.  Political and economic factors, including the ambition to establish independent power and control over resources, also played significant roles.  The conflicts were multifaceted, shaped by religious identity, political aspirations, and economic interests.  The statement fails to account for the complexity of the Sikh-Mughal relationship.


**1. With reference to the Mughal period's literary contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abul Fazl's prose style significantly influenced Persian literature for generations, while his brother Faizi oversaw the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian.
2.  Utbi and Naziri, despite being of Persian origin, contributed significantly to Persian literature at the Mughal court, alongside Hindu scholars who also participated.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of literary development during the Mughal era.  Statement 1 correctly identifies Abul Fazl's lasting impact on Persian prose writing and Faizi's role in the significant translation project of the Mahabharata, a crucial event showcasing the cultural exchange and synthesis of the time. This translation demonstrates Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and the integration of different cultural elements within the Mughal empire.  Statement 2 is also accurate; it highlights the contributions of Persian poets Utbi and Naziri to the Mughal court's literary scene, emphasizing the influx of Persian scholars and the establishment of the court as a prominent cultural center. The inclusion of Hindu scholars underscores the multifaceted nature of the Mughal literary landscape and the participation of various religious and cultural groups.  The options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements, which represent significant and well-documented aspects of Mughal literary history.


**2. With reference to the development of regional languages during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline in the prestige of Sanskrit, coupled with the use of vernacular languages by Bhakti saints, played a significant role in the rise of regional languages.
2.  While some pre-Turkish regional kingdoms used languages like Tamil and Kannada for administration, the Delhi Sultanate primarily employed Persian, with limited use of Hindi for revenue accounting.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the historical context. The diminishing prestige of Sanskrit, once the dominant language of scholarship and administration, created space for the growth of regional languages.  The Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on vernacular devotional poetry and its accessibility to the masses, significantly accelerated this process.  The saints' use of regional languages made religious texts and ideas accessible to a wider population, fostering literacy and literary production in these languages. Statement 2 is also correct; it acknowledges the pre-existing use of regional languages in administration in some kingdoms, but also emphasizes the dominance of Persian under the Delhi Sultanate.  While Hindi was used to some extent, especially in revenue administration, Persian remained the primary language of governance and administration.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect, as they do not fully capture the nuanced and multifaceted nature of regional language development during the medieval period.


**3. With reference to musical developments during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's patronage of Tansen of Gwalior led to the creation of numerous new ragas, and this tradition continued under subsequent Mughal rulers.
2.  Although Aurangzeb is often associated with the suppression of music, recent research suggests he banned only singing in his court, remaining a proficient veena player himself.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately represent aspects of musical history during the Mughal period. Statement 1 correctly points to Akbar's significant patronage of Tansen, a renowned musician from Gwalior, and the resulting enrichment of the existing raga system.  This patronage established a precedent for subsequent Mughal rulers, who also supported and encouraged musical development at their courts. Statement 2 accurately corrects a common misconception about Aurangzeb's attitude towards music.  While he is often portrayed as a staunch opponent of music, recent historical research indicates a more nuanced reality.  He primarily discouraged public singing in his court, but his personal enjoyment and proficiency in playing the veena suggest his stance was not one of complete suppression.  The continued patronage of music by his queens and nobles further supports this.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the validity of both statements, which are supported by historical evidence.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its interaction with the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sikh movement, originating with Guru Nanak's teachings, gained momentum through the institution of guruship, with Guru Arjun completing the compilation of the Adi Granth.
2.  While Akbar initially showed interest in the Sikh gurus, conflicts arose later, particularly under Jahangir, leading to the imprisonment and death of Guru Arjun.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of the Bhakti movement's relationship with the Mughal empire, specifically focusing on the Sikh movement. Statement 1 correctly outlines the development of the Sikh movement, highlighting the role of Guru Nanak and the subsequent gurus in shaping its theological and organizational structure.  Guru Arjun's compilation of the Adi Granth, the Sikh scripture, is a pivotal event in the movement's history, solidifying its identity and providing a foundation for its future growth.  Statement 2 correctly details the initial positive interaction between Akbar and the Sikh gurus, followed by conflicts, especially under Jahangir.  Guru Arjun's imprisonment and execution under Jahangir represent a significant turning point, marking a shift in the relationship between the Sikh movement and the Mughal authorities.  This conflict illustrates the complexities of religious and political interactions during the Mughal period.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the historical accuracy of both statements, which represent well-established facts in the history of the Bhakti movement and the Mughal Empire.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Deccan Sultanates and their cultural contributions:**

1.  Ali Adil Shah of Bijapur, known for his religious tolerance, invited Catholic missionaries to his court and patronized both Sanskrit and Marathi scholarship.
2.  Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur, besides being known for his social welfare initiatives, composed the musical treatise *Kitab-i-Nauras*, showcasing the integration of musical traditions.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the cultural contributions of the Deccan Sultanates. Statement 1 correctly highlights Ali Adil Shah's reputation for religious tolerance and his patronage of both Sanskrit and Marathi scholarship, showcasing the cultural synthesis that characterized the Deccan. His invitation to Catholic missionaries further exemplifies his open-minded approach. Statement 2 accurately describes Ibrahim Adil Shah II’s social welfare initiatives and his composition of *Kitab-i-Nauras*, a musical work that demonstrates the blending of musical traditions in the Deccan.  This underscores the vibrant cultural environment and the patronage of arts and culture by the Deccan rulers.  The options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not fully capture the significant cultural contributions of both rulers, which represent well-documented aspects of Deccan history.


**6. With reference to the reign of  Muhammad bin Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1.  His controversial decision to shift the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad (Deogir) led to significant hardship and discontent, ultimately resulting in its abandonment.
2.  His experiment with token currency, though innovative for its time, failed due to widespread counterfeiting and the inability of the government to effectively control its circulation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe significant events and policies during Muhammad bin Tughlaq's reign. Statement 1 correctly identifies the controversial relocation of the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad as a major policy decision that resulted in widespread hardship and discontent among the populace. The logistical challenges and the disruption caused by the forced migration, coupled with the inherent difficulties of administering a vast empire from a newly established capital, led to the eventual abandonment of Daulatabad. Statement 2 accurately describes the failure of Muhammad bin Tughlaq's experiment with token currency. While the concept was innovative, the lack of effective measures to prevent counterfeiting and the resulting devaluation of the currency contributed to its failure and had considerable economic repercussions.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they do not fully represent the historical significance of both the capital shift and the token currency experiment under Muhammad bin Tughlaq's rule.


**7. With reference to the reign of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax and the pilgrim tax, along with the cessation of forced conversions, laid the foundation for a more inclusive and tolerant empire.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, initially a space for religious discussions among Muslim theologians, was later opened to representatives of various faiths, leading to debates that sometimes alienated orthodox elements.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect significant aspects of Akbar's reign and his religious policies. Statement 1 correctly identifies the abolition of the jizya (poll tax) and pilgrim tax as crucial steps towards creating a more inclusive empire.  This, along with the end of forced conversions, was a major aspect of Akbar's policy of *sulh-i-kul* (universal peace), signifying his commitment to religious tolerance and the equal treatment of all subjects regardless of their faith.  Statement 2 accurately describes the Ibadat Khana's evolution.  It started as a space for discussions among Muslim scholars, but Akbar later expanded its scope to include representatives from various faiths. These discussions, while intended to foster understanding, also led to debates on fundamental religious issues, resulting in the alienation of some orthodox Muslim theologians who were resistant to his more syncretic approach. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to appreciate the historical accuracy of both statements, which represent important and well-documented elements of Akbar's reign and religious policies.


**8. With reference to the cultural and religious developments during the reign of Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aurangzeb's re-imposition of the jizya tax and the demolition of some Hindu temples signify a shift towards a more orthodox and less tolerant religious policy.
2.  Despite Aurangzeb's orthodox policies, liberal religious trends continued among Sufi saints and thinkers, demonstrating the persistence of diverse religious thought within the empire.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the complex religious landscape during Aurangzeb's reign, highlighting the interplay between orthodox and liberal trends. Statement 1 correctly points out Aurangzeb's re-imposition of the jizya tax and the demolition of temples as evidence of a shift towards a more orthodox and less tolerant religious policy compared to Akbar's reign. These actions were significant in alienating some sections of the Hindu population and contributing to the rise of resistance movements. Statement 2 is equally valid; it acknowledges that despite Aurangzeb's orthodox policies, liberal religious and philosophical trends persisted amongst certain Sufi orders and thinkers. This demonstrates the resilience of diverse religious thought and the continued existence of syncretic religious practices within the Mughal empire, even under a ruler known for his orthodox leanings. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they fail to recognize the historical validity of both statements, which represent the complex and multifaceted religious dynamics of Aurangzeb's era.


**9. With reference to the later Mughal period and the rise of regional powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jat uprisings in the Agra-Delhi region, initially driven by agrarian grievances and resistance to land revenue policies, eventually led to the establishment of a separate Jat state.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the rise of regional powers and the challenges they posed to the later Mughal empire. Statement 1 correctly characterizes the Jat uprisings as initially rooted in agrarian concerns and resistance to Mughal land revenue policies. However, these uprisings, through their persistence and evolving leadership, ultimately transformed into a movement for regional autonomy, culminating in the establishment of an independent Jat state in the region.  Statement 2 accurately describes the Afghan uprisings in the northwest as a combination of tribal resistance to Mughal control and the ambition to establish an independent Afghan state.  These uprisings, frequently centered around the strategically important Khyber Pass, posed significant challenges to Mughal authority and control over the region's trade routes and security.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the historical accuracy of both statements, which represent significant aspects of the decline of the Mughal empire and the rise of regional powers.

2.  The integration of Perso-Arabic musical modes (ragas) into the existing Indian classical music system, particularly noticeable in the Gwaliyar kingdom under Raja Man Singh, led to the development of distinct regional styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Statement 1 challenges the conventional narrative of Aurangzeb's complete suppression of music, presenting a more complex picture. It highlights continued private patronage and the production of musical literature, demonstrating the persistence of musical traditions despite official restrictions. This reflects the limitations of generalizations about royal policy and the resilience of cultural practices. Statement 2 accurately describes the fusion of Perso-Arabic influences with Indian classical music, leading to regional variations. The example of Gwaliyar demonstrates the process of musical exchange and adaptation, resulting in the development of unique regional styles.  Therefore, (c) is correct.

2.  The Bhakti songs of Vaishnavite saints, written in Hindi and other regional languages, resonated deeply with Sufis, leading to the use of Hindi in Sufi musical gatherings and the creation of works like the *Hagaig-i-Hindi* by Abdul Wahid Bilgrami, which interpreted Krishna-related terminology in Sufi mystical terms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the significant interaction between the Bhakti movement and Sufism in medieval India.

This shared philosophical ground fostered a climate of interfaith dialogue and mutual understanding, creating a basis for interaction with Bhakti saints who held similar monistic views. Statement 2 correctly emphasizes the influence of Bhakti devotional songs on Sufis, highlighting the adoption of Hindi in Sufi gatherings and the creation of works like *Hagaig-i-Hindi*, which demonstrate attempts to bridge the linguistic and theological gap between the two traditions. This mutual exchange enriched both the Bhakti and Sufi traditions.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the historical evidence supporting both statements about the significant interaction and mutual influence between Bhakti and Sufi traditions.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the contributions of Sanskrit literature during the medieval period:**

Statement 2 correctly points out the limited interaction between Sanskrit and Islamic/Persian literature despite the vast production of Sanskrit works. It acknowledges the exceptions, such as translations of astrological texts and the Yusuf and Zulaikha story, indicating a degree of cultural exchange but also highlighting the overall lack of extensive cross-linguistic translation. This reflects the relative separateness of the two major literary traditions during this period. Option (c) is thus the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are inaccurate as they fail to acknowledge the validity of both statements.


**6. With reference to the political and cultural landscape of the Deccan during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Deccan kingdoms, particularly Bijapur and Golconda, played a significant role in the development of Urdu, fostering its growth as a literary language by integrating elements of Persian, Hindi, and Telugu.
2.  The architectural achievements of the Deccan sultanates, exemplified by the Char Minar in Hyderabad and the Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur, showcased a unique blend of architectural styles, demonstrating cultural synthesis and high artistic standards.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of the Sikh movement and the broader Bhakti movement.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe significant events and their consequences during Aurangzeb’s reign.

This demonstrates the interplay of socioeconomic factors and political aspirations in shaping regional power dynamics. Statement 2 accurately explains the impact of Guru Tegh Bahadur's execution, highlighting how a seemingly administrative decision had far-reaching religious and political consequences.  The event spurred the militarization of the Sikh movement under Guru Gobind Singh, leading to the formation of the Khalsa and setting the stage for future conflicts. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to account for the historical accuracy of both statements.


**9.  With reference to the Rajputana states and their relationship with the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  While Shah Jahan maintained the alliance with Rajput states and utilized their military services, he did not pursue further matrimonial alliances with leading Rajput families, perhaps indicating a shift in the nature of the relationship.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements offer accurate insights into the complex relationship between the Mughal empire and the Rajput states. Statement 1 correctly observes that while Shah Jahan continued to utilize Rajput military support, he did not expand the practice of matrimonial alliances with the Rajput elite. This subtle shift suggests a possible change in the dynamics of the relationship, moving away from the more intimate ties established under Akbar. Statement 2 correctly notes Aurangzeb's pragmatic approach to maintaining the Rajput alliance despite initial conflicts. His efforts to reconcile with Jaswant Singh and appoint him to important positions demonstrate his recognition of the strategic value of the Rajput alliance for the Mughal empire. Option (c) is therefore the correct answer. The other options are incorrect as they fail to recognize the historical accuracy of both statements.


**10. With reference to the political situation in Bengal during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of the political and cultural situation in Bengal during the medieval period. Statement 1 correctly identifies Alauddin Hussain Shah's reign as a significant period for the Bengali language and literature. His inclusive policies, including appointing Hindus to high positions, fostered a flourishing intellectual environment, contributing to the growth of Bengali literature. Statement 2 accurately describes the persistent conflict between the Bengal Sultans and the Ahom kingdom over control of the Brahmaputra valley. The prolonged struggle and the eventual establishment of the Karatoya River as a boundary highlight the limitations of Bengal's expansionist ambitions and the strength of the Ahom kingdom.  Thus, option (c) is correct. The other options are incorrect as they fail to account for the historical evidence supporting both statements.


**1. With reference to the literary contributions during the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abul Fazl's prose style significantly influenced Persian literature for generations, while his brother Faizi spearheaded the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian.
2.  Malik Muhammad Jaisi's "Padmavat," written in medieval Brij Bhasha, allegorically blended Sufi and Hindu ideas.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Abul Fazl, a prominent scholar and historian of Akbar's court, established a prose style that was widely imitated. His brother, Faizi, a renowned poet, played a crucial role in Akbar's translation department, overseeing the Persian translation of the Mahabharata. This highlights the Mughal court's patronage of both Persian literature and the translation of significant Indian works.  The fact that a major Indian epic was translated into the court language demonstrates the cultural exchange and integration taking place under Akbar's rule.  This interaction between Persian and Sanskrit literary traditions is a key aspect of the cultural landscape of the Mughal era.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Malik Muhammad Jaisi, a Sufi saint, authored "Padmavat" in the Brij Bhasha dialect, prevalent near Agra. The work cleverly uses the story of Alauddin Khalji's attack on Chittor as a metaphor for the Sufi concept of the soul's journey towards God, incorporating Hindu ideas about devotion (bhakti). This demonstrates the syncretic nature of the religious and literary landscape of the time, where Sufi mysticism intertwined with existing Hindu traditions. The use of a regional language like Brij Bhasha instead of Persian further showcases the evolving linguistic and literary dynamics of the period.


**2. With reference to the cultural synthesis during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal emperors, particularly Akbar, actively patronized both Hindu and Muslim musicians, leading to a fusion of musical traditions.  Tansen, a renowned musician from Gwalior, served in Akbar's court.
2.  Aurangzeb, despite his orthodox religious views, was a skilled veena player and his queens and court continued to patronize various forms of music.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Akbar's reign witnessed a flourishing of music, with the emperor actively patronizing both Hindu and Muslim musicians.  This resulted in a blend of musical styles and traditions. Tansen, a celebrated musician from Gwalior, is a prime example of a Hindu musician who attained high status in Akbar's court. This patronage underscores Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and his interest in fostering cultural synthesis.  The presence of musicians from diverse backgrounds in the imperial court facilitated the exchange and fusion of musical ideas, enriching the overall musical landscape of the Mughal era.

Statement 2 is also correct. While Aurangzeb is often portrayed as an orthodox ruler who suppressed music, recent research suggests a more nuanced picture. Although he reportedly banned singing in his court,  he himself was a proficient veena player.  Music continued to be patronized by his queens within the royal household (haram) and by other members of the nobility.  The fact that many books on classical Indian music in Persian were written during his reign further refutes the notion of a complete suppression of music under his rule.  This highlights the complexities of Aurangzeb's reign and the limitations of simplistic narratives about his cultural policies.


**3. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement played a significant role in the rise of regional languages, with saint-poets using vernaculars to reach wider audiences, thereby diminishing Sanskrit’s dominance.
2.  The use of regional languages for administrative purposes in pre-Turkish and even during the early Turkish rule, particularly in revenue administration, significantly contributed to their development and standardization.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhakti movement significantly contributed to the development and popularization of regional languages.  Saint-poets like Kabir, Tulsidas, and others employed vernacular languages instead of Sanskrit to convey their religious messages to a wider audience, cutting across caste and social barriers.  This widespread use of regional languages for religious expression challenged the traditional dominance of Sanskrit and contributed to their standardization and evolution as literary mediums. The accessibility of Bhakti literature in regional languages empowered local communities and fostered a sense of cultural identity.

Statement 2 is also accurate.  Even before the arrival of the Turks, several regional languages like Tamil, Kannada, and Marathi were used for administrative purposes in various kingdoms.  This continued to some extent under the Turkish rule, particularly in revenue administration where Hindi-speaking accountants were employed.  This practical application of regional languages in governance helped in their development and standardization. The gradual shift from Sanskrit to regional languages in administration also reflected changing power dynamics and the growing acceptance of vernaculars as effective tools of governance.  The continued use of these languages after the breakup of the Delhi Sultanate further cemented their role in regional administration and cultural life.


**4. With reference to the Rajput rulers' patronage of arts and literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rajput rulers, in addition to military prowess, were significant patrons of Sanskrit literature and learning, with centers like Ujjain and Dhara renowned for Sanskrit scholarship.
2.  Hemachandra Suri, a prominent Jain scholar, made significant contributions to Sanskrit and Apabhramsha literature during this period, showcasing the diverse patronage networks for literary pursuits.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Rajput rulers were not only known for their military achievements but also for their patronage of arts and literature, particularly Sanskrit.  Cities like Ujjain and Dhara, capitals of Paramara rulers, became important centers of Sanskrit learning, attracting scholars and fostering the production of literary and scholarly works. This patronage demonstrates the importance of Sanskrit in maintaining and disseminating Hindu cultural traditions even during periods of political upheaval and interactions with other cultures.  The continued flourishing of Sanskrit scholarship under Rajput rule showcases the resilience of Hindu intellectual traditions.

Statement 2 is also accurate. Hemachandra Suri, a significant Jain scholar, contributed significantly to both Sanskrit and Apabhramsha literature during the period. This highlights the fact that literary patronage was not limited to a single religious or cultural group but extended to various communities, including the Jains, who actively participated in the literary and intellectual life of the time.  Hemachandra's contributions showcase the breadth of literary activity and the diverse sources of patronage for Sanskrit and vernacular languages.  The coexistence of Sanskrit and Apabhramsha literature reflects the linguistic diversity and the evolving literary landscape of medieval India.


**5. With reference to the religious and cultural interactions during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sufi saints, through their use of Bhakti poetry in Hindi and their participation in musical gatherings, facilitated cultural exchange and understanding between Hindus and Muslims.
2.  The concept of "tauhid" (unity of being), popularized by Ibn Arabi, found resonance among many Sufis in India, leading to a syncretic blend of Sufi and Hindu mystical thought.  This is reflected in works such as Abdul Wahid Bilgrami's "Hagaig-i-Hindi."

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sufi saints played a crucial role in fostering cultural exchange and mutual understanding between Hindus and Muslims during the medieval period. They frequently used Bhakti poetry in Hindi in their gatherings, making Sufi concepts more accessible to a wider audience, including Hindus.  Their participation in musical gatherings further facilitated interactions and the sharing of cultural practices.  This blending of musical and poetic traditions demonstrates the syncretic nature of the religious and cultural landscape of the time.  The use of Hindi, a vernacular language, further emphasized the reach and impact of Sufi teachings beyond the confines of the Muslim community.

Statement 2 is also accurate. Ibn Arabi's concept of "tauhid" (unity of being) gained popularity among many Sufis in India. This concept, emphasizing the oneness of all existence and the divine essence underlying all religions, resonated with existing Hindu pantheistic ideas.  This led to a significant exchange of mystical ideas and practices between Sufi and Hindu traditions.  The work "Hagaig-i-Hindi" by Abdul Wahid Bilgrami exemplifies this syncretism, as it attempts to interpret Hindu religious terms like "Krishna" and "Radha" within a Sufi mystical framework.  This demonstrates the intellectual and spiritual exchange that took place between the two religious traditions.

2.  The establishment of Muslim trading colonies and the arrival of Sufi preachers facilitated a gradual process of interaction and cultural exchange between the two communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly describes two distinct phases of early Muslim-Hindu interaction. Statement 1 accurately captures the initial phase characterized by Ghaznavid raids motivated by plunder, encountering significant resistance from Rajput rulers. This highlights the initial conflict and the defensive stance of the existing power structures. Statement 2 correctly describes the subsequent phase where Muslim traders and Sufi preachers played a crucial role in fostering interaction and cultural exchange. The establishment of trading colonies created opportunities for contact, and the Sufi emphasis on love and faith fostered a more conciliatory environment.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete representations of the historical reality, failing to capture the nuanced and multi-faceted nature of the early interactions between the two communities.


**3. With reference to the political and military aspects of the Ghurid conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid Sultan Alauddin earned the title "jahan-soz" (world burner) for his destruction of Ghazni, reflecting the Ghurids' initial focus on consolidating power in Central Asia before turning their attention to India.
2.  The first battle of Tarain (1191) resulted in a decisive victory for the Chauhans under Prithviraj Chauhan, delaying the Ghurid conquest of India for a considerable period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies Alauddin's title and the context of the Ghurid conquest.  The destruction of Ghazni demonstrates the Ghurids' ambition and power, and their subsequent shift towards India for expansion after consolidating their regional power base.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The first battle of Tarain resulted in a Ghurid defeat, but it did *not* significantly delay the conquest.  Prithviraj's failure to capitalize on his victory allowed Muizzuddin Muhammad to regroup and ultimately win the second battle of Tarain the following year, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the outcome of the first battle of Tarain and its impact on the Ghurid campaign.


**4.  With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline in Brahmanical prestige and the rise of Bhakti saints contributed to the increased use and development of regional languages for literary purposes.
2.  The Delhi Sultanate actively promoted the use of regional languages for administrative purposes, leading to a parallel development of Persian and regional literary traditions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the socio-cultural context for the rise of regional languages. The diminishing influence of Sanskrit, coupled with the widespread popularity of Bhakti movements utilizing vernacular languages, created a conducive environment for their literary flourishing.  Statement 2 is partially correct in that regional languages were used administratively, but it overstates the Sultanate's active promotion. While some regional languages were used, Persian remained the primary administrative language of the Delhi Sultanate. The development of parallel literary traditions occurred more organically, influenced by the interaction of different cultures and linguistic practices. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to an inaccurate or incomplete understanding of the role of the Delhi Sultanate in the development of regional languages and the relationship between Bhakti movements and linguistic shifts.


**5. With reference to the cultural synthesis in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Amir Khusrau, a prominent figure, introduced several Perso-Arabic musical airs (ragas) and is credited with inventing the sitar, significantly influencing the evolution of Indian classical music.
2.  Raja Man Singh of Gwalior played a crucial role in documenting the new musical modes introduced by the Muslims, contributing to the integration of Persian and Indian musical traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies Amir Khusrau's contributions to music but mistakenly attributes the invention of the sitar to him. While he introduced Perso-Arabic ragas and significantly impacted music, the sitar's exact origins are debated and not definitively linked to him.  Statement 2 is correct. Raja Man Singh of Gwalior's patronage of the work *Mari Kautuhal*, which documented new musical modes, showcases the integration of Persian and Indian musical traditions during this period.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to fully appreciate the nuances of the historical evidence, particularly regarding the attribution of the sitar's invention and the accurate representation of Raja Man Singh's role in preserving and integrating musical styles.


**6. With reference to the religious and intellectual climate of the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement, opposed Akbar's liberal religious policies and advocated for the re-imposition of jizya.
2.  Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Shah Jahan, promoted a syncretic approach to religion, exemplified by his translation of the Bhagavad Gita into Persian and his assertion of harmony between the Vedas and the Quran.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately represent contrasting religious viewpoints during the Mughal period. Statement 1 correctly identifies Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's opposition to Akbar's religious syncretism and his advocacy for orthodox Islamic practices, including the re-imposition of jizya. This represents a clear counterpoint to the more liberal approaches of some Mughal rulers.  Statement 2 accurately describes Dara Shikoh's efforts to bridge religious divides, exemplified by his translation of the Bhagavad Gita and his emphasis on the compatibility of the Vedas and the Quran.  This demonstrates a significant attempt at religious synthesis. Options (a), (b), and (d) are inadequate because they fail to recognize the historical accuracy of both statements, which represent significant and contrasting intellectual currents within the Mughal empire.



**7. With reference to the political dynamics of the late medieval period in South India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bahmani kingdom's disintegration into five successor states—Golconda, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Bidar—led to prolonged conflicts and weakened the region's ability to withstand external threats.
2.  Krishna Deva Raya's reign marked the apex of the Vijayanagara Empire's military power, culminating in significant victories against Bijapur and other rivals, but neglecting naval development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately capture significant aspects of the political landscape in South India. Statement 1 correctly describes the fragmentation of the Bahmani kingdom and its consequences.  The emergence of multiple successor states led to intense competition and instability, hindering their collective ability to resist external forces. Statement 2 accurately portrays Krishna Deva Raya's military successes and his neglect of naval power. His victories against Bijapur and other rivals strengthened the Vijayanagara Empire's position, but his failure to develop a strong navy left them vulnerable to maritime threats. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to grasp the interconnectedness of the events and the impact of the political changes on the power dynamics in South India.


**8.  With reference to the Bhakti movement and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kabir and Nanak, while emphasizing monotheism and social equality, did not explicitly aim to found new religions, yet their teachings significantly shaped the religious landscape of India.
2.  The Vaishnava Bhakti movement, centered around the worship of Rama and Krishna, utilized allegorical interpretations of their stories to convey spiritual messages and promote a more inclusive religious approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of the Bhakti movement and its influence.

Their emphasis on monotheism and social equality resonated widely and influenced subsequent religious movements. Statement 2 accurately highlights the Vaishnava Bhakti movement's use of allegorical interpretations of Rama and Krishna's stories to convey complex spiritual ideas in an accessible manner. This approach helped to broaden the appeal of their message and promote a more inclusive religious outlook. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete or inaccurate portrayals of the Bhakti movement's impact and its diverse expressions.

1.  The Delhi Sultans, while proclaiming themselves lieutenants of the Abbasid Caliph, held supreme political, military, and legal authority within their dominion.
2.  Firuz Shah Tughlaq, despite his orthodox leanings, initiated several humanitarian measures such as establishing hospitals and providing dowries for the poor, while also undertaking significant public works projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Delhi Sultanate's administration and social policies. Statement 1 correctly describes the Sultans' position. While acknowledging their symbolic connection to the Abbasid Caliph, it emphasizes their ultimate sovereignty within their realm.  Statement 2 correctly highlights Firuz Shah Tughlaq's contradictory nature, balancing his orthodox religious views with pragmatic social and economic policies.  His humanitarian measures, alongside his extensive public works, showcase a complex approach to governance. Options (a), (b), and (d) are inadequate because they do not fully capture the complexities of the Sultanate's governance and its blend of religious conservatism and social reform.


**10. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The lack of a clear tradition of succession within the Mughal dynasty, combined with internal conflicts among the princes, significantly contributed to the weakening of the empire.
2.  The Jat and Sikh uprisings, driven by agrarian discontent and religious factors, respectively, along with the Afghan rebellions, challenged Mughal authority and hastened the empire's decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements identify crucial factors contributing to the decline of the Mughal Empire. Statement 1 correctly points to the absence of a clear succession system, leading to frequent power struggles among the princes.  This internal conflict diverted resources and weakened the central authority.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the challenges posed by various regional uprisings. The Jat and Sikh uprisings, reflecting socio-economic and religious grievances, alongside the Afghan rebellions, all drained the empire's resources and undermined its control over vast territories. Options (a), (b), and (d) are insufficient as they fail to acknowledge the interplay of internal and external factors that resulted in the weakening and eventual decline of the Mughal Empire.


**1. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its prominent figures, consider the following statements:**

1. Namadeva, known for his Marathi poetry expressing intense devotion, engaged in discussions with Sufi saints in Delhi.
2. Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, taught his Bhakti doctrine to all four varnas, disregarding caste restrictions on communal dining.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Bhakti movement.  Statement 1 correctly identifies Namadeva's significant contribution through his Marathi devotional poetry and his interactions with Sufi saints in Delhi, highlighting the cross-cultural exchange during the period. This underscores the movement's inclusive nature and its transcendence of religious boundaries. Statement 2 accurately portrays Ramananda's revolutionary approach to Bhakti, emphasizing his disregard for traditional caste hierarchies in his teachings and practice.  By extending his doctrine to all four varnas and encouraging inter-caste interactions, Ramananda challenged the rigid social structure of the time and promoted social equality. The inclusion of disciples from diverse castes, such as Ravidas (cobbler), Kabir (weaver), Sena (barber), and Sadhana (butcher), further exemplifies this inclusive ethos. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially represent the information; option (d) is incorrect as both statements are factually accurate representations of the Bhakti movement's key figures and their contributions.


**2. With reference to the contributions of Kabir and Nanak, consider the following statements:**

1. Kabir, believed to have been raised by a Muslim weaver, emphasized the unity of God, regardless of nomenclature (Allah, Sain, Sahib, etc.), and rejected idol worship and pilgrimages.
2. Guru Nanak, born into a Khatri family, established a new religion, Sikhism, through his teachings emphasizing monotheism and the importance of a guru for guidance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Kabir's life and teachings.  The legend of his upbringing by a Muslim weaver highlights the syncretic nature of his background and influences. His emphasis on the unity of God, irrespective of the name used, and his rejection of traditional Hindu practices like idol worship and pilgrimages are central to his philosophy. This rejection of ritualistic aspects of both Hinduism and Islam showcases his focus on a more personal and direct path to spiritual enlightenment.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Guru Nanak's teachings emphasized monotheism and the importance of a guru, he did not initially intend to found a new religion. Sikhism emerged gradually from his teachings and those of his successors.  The assertion that he "established" Sikhism is an oversimplification of a complex historical process. Option (a) is correct because it accurately reflects the key aspects of Kabir's life and teachings. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statement 2 regarding the immediate establishment of Sikhism as a distinct religion.


**3. With reference to the socio-religious context of the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The decline of Rajput rulers and the rise of the Turkish Sultanate weakened the Brahmanical order, creating fertile ground for movements challenging the caste system.
2. The Sufi saints' emphasis on equality and brotherhood, along with the Bhakti saints’ focus on emotional and rational religious experience, contributed to the Bhakti movement's popularity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the socio-religious context that facilitated the rise and spread of the Bhakti movement. Statement 1 correctly identifies the weakening of the Brahmanical order as a contributing factor. The decline in Rajput power and the establishment of the Turkish Sultanate created a power vacuum and social instability, leading to a questioning of traditional authority and social hierarchies. This created an environment receptive to alternative religious and social ideologies, such as those promoted by the Bhakti movement. Statement 2 correctly highlights the influence of Sufi ideals and the Bhakti saints' focus on a more personal and accessible form of religious experience. The Sufis' emphasis on equality and brotherhood resonated with the masses, who were increasingly dissatisfied with the rigid caste system and the emphasis on rituals and ceremonies in traditional Hinduism. The Bhakti saints, in turn, provided a religious experience that appealed to both reason and emotion, further contributing to the movement's widespread appeal.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the interconnectedness of the factors described in both statements, which were crucial to the success of the Bhakti movement.


**4. With reference to the regional languages and their development during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the factors that contributed to the rise and development of regional languages during the medieval period. Statement 1 correctly identifies the decline in Sanskrit's prestige and the Bhakti movement's role. The loss of Brahmanical prestige led to a decrease in Sanskrit's dominance, creating space for vernacular languages to flourish.  The Bhakti saints' deliberate use of regional languages to reach a wider audience played a crucial role in popularizing and standardizing these languages for literary expression.  Statement 2 correctly highlights the administrative and royal patronage that further facilitated the development of regional languages. The Delhi Sultanate's use of Hindi in revenue administration demonstrates the practical application and acceptance of these languages.  The patronage given by various regional kingdoms, such as the Vijayanagara rulers promoting Telugu and the Bahmani kingdom supporting Marathi, further solidified their status and contributed to their literary growth. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they only partially address the multifaceted process of regional language development during the medieval period. The combined effect of the factors mentioned in both statements is essential to understanding this historical phenomenon.

Both statements accurately reflect the evolution of musical traditions during the medieval period. Statement 1 correctly points to Amir Khusrau's significant contributions. He was a pivotal figure in the fusion of Indian and Perso-Arabic musical traditions, introducing new ragas and potentially inventing the sitar, although the latter claim lacks definitive historical evidence. His contributions highlight the early stages of musical exchange and integration. Statement 2 correctly describes the continuation of this process under subsequent rulers.  The patronage given by rulers like Firuz Shah Tughlaq and Sultan Husain Sharqi fostered further integration and innovation in music. This led to the development of distinct regional styles, showcasing the diverse musical landscape of the medieval era. While the exact details of instruments' origins may be debated, the overall trend of musical fusion and regional diversification is well-documented. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as both statements reflect accurate aspects of the historical development of musical traditions during the period.  The combined effect of these factors shaped the musical landscape of medieval India.


**6. With reference to the political organization and administration of the Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta empires, consider the following statements:**

1.  These empires followed a system based on Gupta precedents, featuring a centralized monarchical structure with ministers advising the king and a hierarchical administrative system extending to the village level.
2. The empires comprised directly administered territories and areas ruled by autonomous vassal chiefs who paid tribute and supplied troops but often challenged the overlord's authority.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately portray key characteristics of the political organization and administration of the Pala, Pratihara, and Rashtrakuta empires. Statement 1 correctly notes the administrative system's foundation in Gupta precedents. These empires followed a centralized monarchical structure where the king held supreme authority,  advised by ministers and a council. The hierarchical system extended from the central government to provincial and district levels, down to the village administration, reflecting continuity and adaptation of earlier administrative models. Statement 2 correctly emphasizes the dual nature of these empires' territorial control.  They comprised both directly administered areas and regions ruled by vassal chiefs. These chiefs enjoyed significant autonomy in internal affairs, but were obligated to pay tribute and provide military support to the overlord.  However, the relationship was often fraught with tension, as vassal chiefs frequently challenged the overlord's authority, leading to conflicts and wars. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; both statements present accurate descriptions of the political structures and dynamics prevalent in the three empires.  Understanding both aspects is crucial for comprehending the complexities of medieval Indian political history.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire and its administration. Statement 1 correctly highlights the importance of the Chola navy. The Chola navy was a crucial element of their power, enabling them to extend their influence across the Bay of Bengal. Their naval dominance facilitated conquests in Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and parts of Southeast Asia, and allowed them to control vital trade routes, contributing significantly to their economic prosperity. Statement 2 correctly describes the dual nature of Chola administration. While the empire had a strong centralized structure with provincial governors appointed by the king, it also incorporated a notable degree of local self-governance, especially in villages. Village assemblies, such as the Sabha and Ur, played a significant role in managing local affairs, indicating a sophisticated system that balanced central control with local autonomy.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements offer accurate and significant insights into the Chola Empire's military capabilities and administrative structures.  Understanding both aspects is key to a comprehensive understanding of Chola governance.


**8. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and its relations with other powers, consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements offer accurate insights into the Vijayanagara Empire and its interactions with other powers. Statement 1 correctly describes the empire’s peak under Deva Raya II.  His reign witnessed the empire's expansion and consolidation of power, leading to vast territories, significant wealth, and tributary relationships with several kingdoms, including those in Sri Lanka, although the extent of tributary relationships with Burma and Malaya requires further scrutiny.  The descriptions by foreign travelers like Nicolo Conti and Abdur Razzaq corroborate the empire’s power and wealth at that time. Statement 2 correctly identifies the primary conflict as being with the Bahmani Sultanate.  The conflicts between these two powers were driven by geopolitical factors, such as control over strategic territories (Krishna-Godavari basin and coastal ports) and trade routes. While religious differences existed, the conflicts were not primarily religiously motivated but rather centered around political and strategic considerations for power and economic control. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; both statements accurately reflect the political realities and significant relationships of the Vijayanagara Empire during the period.  Understanding both aspects is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the empire's history.

His military prowess played a crucial role in the kingdom's expansion and consolidation of power. Statement 2 accurately describes his administrative reforms.  Mahmud Gawan implemented significant administrative reforms to improve efficiency and strengthen the kingdom's governance.  His division of the kingdom into eight provinces with clearly defined responsibilities and salaries for nobles, along with the efforts to standardize land measurement and revenue collection, aimed at creating a more efficient and equitable administrative structure.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; both statements accurately capture Mahmud Gawan's significant contributions to the Bahmani kingdom's military and administrative spheres.  Understanding both aspects is essential for a complete picture of his impact on the kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Abul Fazl, a leading historian and stylist, established a prose-writing style that was widely imitated for many generations. This highlights his profound impact on Persian literature in India.  His style became a benchmark for subsequent writers, showcasing the cultural exchange and integration during the Mughal period.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text clearly mentions that Faizi, Abul Fazl's brother, played a crucial role in Akbar's translation department and oversaw the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian.  This demonstrates Akbar's policy of cultural synthesis, incorporating elements of Indian culture into the Mughal court's literary landscape. The translation project itself is a significant example of cross-cultural interaction and the dissemination of Indian epic literature within a Persian context.  Both statements reflect the active engagement of the Mughal court in fostering a blend of Indian and Persian cultural elements.


**2. With reference to the literary contributions during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The majority of Sanskrit literary works produced during this period originated from South and East India, with Banaras serving as a major center.
2.  The "Padmavat," a Hindi work by Malik Muhammad Jaisi, allegorically uses Alauddin Khalji's attack on Chittor to explore Sufi and Hindu concepts of the soul's relationship with God.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that while Sanskrit works were produced across India,  the majority originated from South and East India, with Banaras acting as a central hub for scholars. This highlights the continued importance of Sanskrit scholarship within specific regions of India, even during the Mughal period. The concentration in these regions points to the existence of established patronage networks and educational institutions that maintained Sanskrit traditions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage directly describes the "Padmavat" as a Hindi work by Malik Muhammad Jaisi, who used Alauddin Khalji's attack on Chittor as an allegory to illustrate Sufi and Hindu ideas about the soul's connection with the divine. This exemplifies the syncretic nature of literature during the period, blending Sufi mysticism with Hindu concepts. The use of a historical event as an allegorical framework demonstrates the sophisticated literary techniques employed and the attempt to bridge religious divides through creative expression.


**3. With reference to the development of regional languages during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The lyrical poetry of this era frequently featured themes from the Bhagavata Purana, including Krishna's interactions with Radha and the milkmaids.
2.  The Ramayana and Mahabharata were translated into several regional languages, including those which had already seen earlier translations, to further broaden their reach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage indicates that themes from the Bhagavata Purana, such as Krishna's stories, were prominent in the lyrical poetry of various regional languages like Bengali, Oriya, Hindi, Rajasthani, and Gujarati. This demonstrates the adaptation of religious narratives into popular literary forms in vernacular languages, a key aspect of cultural expression during the period. The focus on Krishna's life reflects the popularity of Bhakti movements and their influence on regional literary traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage specifically states that the Ramayana and Mahabharata were translated into regional languages, *especially if they had not been translated earlier.* This implies that some regional languages already possessed translations of these epics before the Mughal period.  The statement incorrectly suggests that all regional languages received *new* translations during the Mughal era, overlooking the pre-existing translations.


**4. With reference to the religious and cultural developments during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sikh movement's development was significantly linked to the institution of Guruship, with Guru Arjun completing the compilation of the Adi Granth.
2.  While Aurangzeb banished singing from his court, he was himself a skilled veena player, and music continued to be patronized within the royal household and by nobles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage directly links the development of the Sikh movement to the institution of Guruship and explicitly states that Guru Arjun Das compiled the Sikh scriptures, the Adi Granth (also known as Granth Sahib). This highlights the crucial role of the Gurus in shaping Sikh religious and political identity. The compilation of the Adi Granth represents a significant milestone in the consolidation of Sikh religious doctrine and practice.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage notes that while Aurangzeb banned singing in his court (a commonly held belief), recent research suggests he was a proficient veena player, and music continued to flourish within the royal household (haram) and among nobles. This challenges the traditional narrative of Aurangzeb as a complete opponent of music and underscores the complexities of his reign regarding cultural patronage. The continuation of musical traditions despite the official ban indicates the resilience of cultural practices.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Bhakti movement:**

1.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, advocated for the worship of Rama instead of Vishnu and extended his teachings to all four varnas, disregarding caste restrictions on communal meals.
2.  Kabir, a weaver, and Nanak, from a Khatri family, both criticized the existing social order and strongly advocated for Hindu-Muslim unity, emphasizing monotheism and rejecting idol worship and pilgrimages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Ramananda's teachings. The passage details his substitution of Rama for Vishnu in worship and his inclusive approach to discipleship, breaking down traditional caste barriers in religious practice. His emphasis on Bhakti and disregard for caste-based restrictions on food sharing were crucial in the movement's appeal to a wider populace.  This inclusive nature was a defining characteristic of the Bhakti movement's social impact.

Statement 2 correctly identifies Kabir and Nanak's shared emphasis on monotheism, social critique, and the promotion of Hindu-Muslim unity.  The passage highlights their rejection of idol worship, pilgrimages, and other traditional religious practices, advocating instead for a more inclusive and egalitarian spiritual path. Their combined influence significantly shaped the religious and social landscape of the time, promoting a message of unity and challenging the existing social hierarchy.  Their focus on personal devotion and rejection of ritualistic practices was a significant departure from established norms.



**6. With reference to the composition of the Mughal nobility, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Akbar, the proportion of Hindus in the Mughal nobility was approximately 16%, although individuals like Raja Man Singh and Raja Birbal held significant influence.
2.  During Aurangzeb's reign, the proportion of Hindu nobles increased significantly, with Marathas comprising more than half of the Hindu nobles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage provides a specific figure (approximately 16%) for the Hindu representation in Akbar's nobility. Despite the relatively low percentage, the text emphasizes the significant influence held by individuals like Raja Man Singh and Raja Birbal, indicating that numerical representation does not fully capture the impact of Hindu participation in the Mughal court.  The inclusion of prominent Hindu figures highlights Akbar's policy of religious tolerance and the integration of diverse elements into the ruling class.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The passage explicitly states that during the latter half of Aurangzeb's reign, the proportion of Hindu nobles rose to approximately 33%, with Marathas making up over half of this Hindu contingent. This demonstrates a significant shift in the composition of the Mughal nobility, reflecting changing political dynamics and the rise of Maratha power in the Deccan.  The increase in Hindu representation, particularly Marathas, reflects the changing power balance within the Mughal empire.


**7. With reference to the Mughal administrative system, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar initially adopted Sher Shah Suri's land revenue system but later modified it due to issues with the central price schedule causing hardship to peasants.
2.  The Mughal nobility, though receiving high salaries, incurred significant expenses maintaining large households, stables, and engaging in lavish lifestyles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately depicts Akbar's land revenue reforms. The passage explains that while Akbar initially adopted Sher Shah Suri's system, he later made adjustments due to the problems arising from the centrally fixed price schedule, which often led to unfair treatment of the peasantry.  This highlights the practical challenges of implementing a uniform system across diverse regions and the need for adaptation based on local conditions.  Akbar's modifications demonstrate his pragmatic approach to governance.

Statement 2 correctly describes the lifestyle and expenses of the Mughal nobility. The passage details the high salaries received by nobles but also emphasizes their significant expenditures on maintaining large households, extensive stables, and luxurious lifestyles. This illustrates the feudal nature of the Mughal system and the economic power wielded by the nobility. The lavish lifestyle of the nobility, while contributing to economic activity, also contributed to social inequalities.


**8. With reference to the Deccan and its relationship with the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shah Jahan's treaties with Bijapur and Golconda in 1636 established Mughal suzerainty over the entire country, bringing about a period of relative peace and allowing the Deccani states to expand southward.
2.  The Deccani states, including Bijapur and Golconda, made significant cultural contributions, including patronage of Sanskrit and Marathi literature, music (like Ibrahim Adil Shah II's "Kitizb-i-Nawras"), and architecture (such as the Charminar and Gol Gumbaz).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the outcome of Shah Jahan's Deccan policy. The treaties of 1636 with Bijapur and Golconda established Mughal suzerainty, leading to a period of relative peace and enabling the Deccani states to expand their territories southwards. This reflects Shah Jahan's strategy of consolidating Mughal power through diplomacy and strategic alliances.  The period of relative peace facilitated economic and cultural growth in the Deccan.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage details the significant cultural contributions of the Deccani states, including their patronage of Sanskrit and Marathi literature, the development of music (as exemplified by Ibrahim Adil Shah II's musical work), and architectural achievements such as the Charminar in Golconda and the Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur.  These contributions showcase a rich blend of cultural influences and a high level of artistic and intellectual activity within the Deccan region.  The architectural marvels reflect the sophisticated engineering and artistic skills prevalent in the Deccan.


**9. With reference to Aurangzeb's Deccan campaigns, consider the following statements:**

1.  Jai Singh's Bijapur campaign in 1665 failed due to a lack of siege weaponry and the united Deccani resistance, highlighting the challenges of a purely military approach in the Deccan.
2.  Aurangzeb's conquest of Bijapur and Golconda in 1686 and 1687, respectively, marked a significant military triumph but also initiated a more difficult phase marked by prolonged conflict with the Marathas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the challenges faced by Jai Singh in his 1665 campaign. The passage explains that Jai Singh's campaign against Bijapur failed due to a lack of siege equipment and the unified resistance of the Deccani states. This underscores the difficulties inherent in conquering the Deccan through purely military means, highlighting the importance of diplomacy and strategic alliances in this region.  The failure of the campaign demonstrated the limitations of a purely military approach without adequate logistical support and strategic alliances.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The passage clearly states that Aurangzeb's conquest of Bijapur and Golconda represented a major military victory but simultaneously initiated a new and more challenging phase of conflict, primarily against the Marathas.  This highlights the fact that while Aurangzeb achieved significant military success, his conquests did not lead to lasting peace in the Deccan and instead ignited a prolonged and devastating conflict with the Marathas. The prolonged conflict with the Marathas would eventually contribute to the weakening of the Mughal empire.


**10.  With reference to the Jat and Sikh movements, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jat uprisings, initially agrarian in nature, ultimately led to the establishment of an independent Jat principality, reflecting the transformation of a peasant movement into a regional power.
2.  The Afghan uprisings in the Northwest, while partly economic and political, also saw the emergence of a separatist sentiment aiming to create an independent Afghan state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the evolution of the Jat movement. The passage traces the Jat uprisings from their initial agrarian roots to their culmination in the establishment of an independent Jat principality under Churaman.  This illustrates the complex interplay of social, economic, and political factors that can transform a localized peasant movement into a regional power. The shift from agrarian unrest to state formation underscores the dynamic nature of political change in the Mughal empire.

Statement 2 accurately depicts the nature of the Afghan uprisings. The passage describes the Afghan uprisings as having economic, political, and religious dimensions, but also emphasizes the presence of a separatist sentiment aiming to establish an independent Afghan state.  This highlights the diverse motivations behind the uprisings and the significance of regional identity and self-determination in shaping the conflicts within the Mughal empire.  The Afghan uprisings demonstrate the challenges faced by the Mughal empire in controlling its peripheral regions.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim to be challenging and require detailed knowledge of the provided source material, going beyond simple recall.


**1. With reference to the socio-economic conditions of the Indian masses during the early modern period, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers uniformly reported widespread affluence across all social strata in India, contrasting sharply with the poverty prevalent in Europe at the time.
2.  The dietary habits of the common people included a staple diet primarily consisting of rice, millets, pulses, and occasionally supplemented with fish or meat, depending on regional availability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While European accounts often noted the wealth and extravagance of the ruling classes, they consistently highlighted the stark poverty and inadequate clothing of the majority of the population – peasants, artisans, and laborers.  The accounts of Babur, Ralph Fitch, and De Laet, among others, provide compelling evidence of this disparity.  The statement misrepresents the consensus view presented in the source material.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that rice, millets, and pulses formed the staple diet of the ordinary people, with regional variations incorporating fish (in coastal and Bengal regions) and meat (in the south).  This reflects the agricultural diversity and food production capabilities of the time. The description accurately reflects the commonly consumed food items by the common people.


**2. With reference to the agrarian structure and peasant life in early modern India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The term "khudkash" refers to landless peasants who primarily worked as laborers for zamindars or upper castes, often facing severe hardship during famines.
2.  Land ownership was largely hereditary, with peasant's children inheriting their land after their death, though state dues sometimes consumed a significant portion of their produce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text defines "khudkash" as peasants who owned the land they cultivated, paying land revenue at customary rates.  The description of landless peasants and laborers is accurate, but it incorrectly attributes this to the term "khudkash."  The statement conflates two distinct categories of peasants.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that peasants could not be dispossessed from their land as long as they paid land revenue, and their children inherited the land.  The mention of heavy state dues, sometimes amounting to nearly half the produce, accurately reflects the economic challenges faced by many peasants.


**3. With reference to the Mughal nobility and its role in the empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal nobility was exclusively composed of Central Asian immigrants, reflecting a rigid policy of excluding Indian-born individuals from high offices.
2.  While the Mughal nobility initially played a crucial role in maintaining peace and security, its eventual decline was primarily due to the cessation of immigration from Central Asia after Aurangzeb's death.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly refutes this, stating that while many nobles were initially from Central Asia, Mughal rulers did not follow a narrow racist policy and recruited from various backgrounds, including Indians and Afghans. The statement incorrectly portrays the composition of the Mughal nobility as homogenous.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text argues against this explanation for the decline of the Mughal nobility. It attributes the decline to internal factors like the breakdown of the administrative machinery, the jagirdari system crisis, and Aurangzeb’s policies, not solely the end of Central Asian immigration. The statement oversimplifies the complex reasons behind the decline.


**4. With reference to the economic conditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The wages of unskilled laborers in the Mughal era remained consistently low, barely sufficient to support a family, indicating a stagnant standard of living for the working class.
2.  The Mughal state's policies, such as the zabt system and cash salary payments, significantly contributed to the growth of a money economy and the commercialization of the agrarian sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text mentions the low wages of unskilled laborers, often less than two rupees a month, barely enough to feed a family. This points towards the harsh economic realities faced by the working class.  The statement accurately reflects the economic conditions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text highlights the zabt system's role in assessing land revenue in cash and the cash salary payments to many administrative personnel as factors that promoted a money economy and commercialization. The statement accurately describes the impact of Mughal policies on the economy.


**5. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan states, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gol Gumbaz, known for its exceptionally large dome and acoustic properties, is a notable architectural achievement of the Bijapur Sultanate.
2.  The Charminar, a landmark structure in Hyderabad, was constructed during the reign of Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur, showcasing the Deccan's architectural prowess.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text specifically mentions the Gol Gumbaz of Bijapur as a testament to the architectural excellence of the Bijapur Sultanate, highlighting its large dome and unique acoustic features.  The statement correctly identifies the building and its location.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Charminar is correctly attributed to Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda, not Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur. The statement incorrectly assigns the construction of the Charminar to the wrong ruler and kingdom.


**6. With reference to the religious and social life in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Smriti literature of the period consistently advocated for the abolition of the caste system, promoting social equality and inter-caste mingling.
2.  The practice of purdah, or the seclusion of women, became widespread among the upper classes, influenced by various social, religious, and historical factors.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Smriti literature, while sometimes criticizing unworthy Brahmins, did not advocate for the abolition of the caste system. Instead, it largely reinforced existing social hierarchies and prescribed duties for different castes. The statement misrepresents the content of Smriti literature.

Statement 2 is correct. The text details the spread of purdah among upper-class women, attributing it to a combination of social aspirations, historical anxieties (like the fear of abduction), and religious justifications. The statement accurately describes the prevalence and reasons behind the practice of purdah.


**7. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of regional languages was primarily due to the patronage of the Mughal emperors, who actively promoted the use of these languages in administration and literature.
2.  The Bhakti movement played a significant role in the development and popularization of regional languages, as saints often used vernacular languages to communicate their message.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some Muslim rulers did patronize regional languages later on, the primary drivers were not Mughal imperial policies. The text highlights factors such as a decline in Sanskrit's prestige, the use of vernacular languages by Bhakti saints, and their pre-existing use in some regional kingdoms. The statement overemphasizes the Mughal role.

Statement 2 is correct. The text emphasizes the crucial role of Bhakti saints in popularizing and developing regional languages for literary purposes.  The statement correctly identifies the Bhakti movement's contribution.


**8. With reference to the early Mughal conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Babur's conquest of India was primarily motivated by his desire to acquire the vast wealth and resources of the region to consolidate his power and support his army.
2.  The Battle of Panipat (1526) was a decisive victory for Babur, instantly establishing his undisputed control over the entire Indian subcontinent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states Babur's motivations for invading India, including the meagre resources of Kabul and the lure of India's wealth. The statement accurately reflects Babur's primary motivations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Battle of Panipat was a significant victory, it did not instantly secure Babur's control over the entire subcontinent.  He faced further battles against Rana Sanga and others before consolidating his power. The statement incorrectly portrays the immediate outcome of the battle.


**9. With reference to the integration of various communities and cultures within the Mughal empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's reign witnessed a significant degree of cultural synthesis, with Hindus and Muslims cooperating in various fields like literature, music, and administration.
2.  Aurangzeb's policies, characterized by religious orthodoxy and intolerance, effectively halted the process of cultural integration initiated during Akbar's reign and led to widespread communal conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text highlights Akbar's reign as a period of significant cultural synthesis, with Hindus and Muslims collaborating in various aspects of life.  The statement accurately reflects the cultural climate under Akbar's rule.

Statement 2 is an oversimplification. While Aurangzeb's reign saw a shift towards religious orthodoxy, the text doesn't suggest a complete cessation of cultural interaction or widespread communal conflict as an immediate and direct result.  The statement presents a simplistic and potentially biased interpretation of a complex historical period.  Cultural interactions continued, albeit perhaps in a modified form.


**10. With reference to the economic activities of merchants in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Wealthy merchants in major cities often lived ostentatiously, mimicking the lifestyles of the nobility, while ordinary merchants sometimes tried to appear less wealthy to avoid exploitation.
2.  Despite enjoying considerable wealth and engaging in extensive trade networks, merchants held a high social status in medieval India, wielding significant political influence.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text describes the contrasting lifestyles of wealthy and ordinary merchants, noting the ostentatious displays of the former and the attempts by the latter to appear less affluent to avoid potential victimization.  The statement accurately reflects the social dynamics.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that merchants, despite their wealth, generally held a low social status, although they possessed some political influence in matters directly concerning their commercial interests.  The statement incorrectly portrays their social standing.


**1. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its socio-religious impact, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement's emphasis on a personal God challenged the rigid caste hierarchy prevalent in Hinduism, leading to a degree of social reform.
2.  The Bhakti saints, while advocating for devotion and love for God, largely maintained the traditional Hindu practices of idol worship and adherence to scriptures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bhakti movement, a significant religious and social reform movement in medieval India, profoundly impacted the socio-religious landscape. Statement 1 accurately reflects one of its key contributions.  The movement's focus on a personal God, accessible through devotion (bhakti) rather than rigid ritualistic adherence, implicitly challenged the Brahmanical dominance and the entrenched caste system. While it didn't completely dismantle the caste system, it significantly softened its rigidity by emphasizing the equality of all before God.  Saints like Kabir and Ramananda actively included people from all castes in their discipleship, challenging traditional social norms.

Statement 2 is also correct because, while the Bhakti movement stressed personal devotion, it did not uniformly reject traditional Hindu practices.  Many Bhakti saints, particularly the Vaishnavite ones, continued to venerate traditional deities like Rama and Krishna, incorporating them into their bhakti framework.  The use of devotional hymns, temple worship, and stories from scriptures like the Ramayana and Mahabharata remained integral to their practice.  Therefore, the movement presented a synthesis of traditional and reformist elements, making both statements accurate.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to capture the multifaceted nature of the Bhakti movement's influence.


**2. With reference to the interaction between Sufi and Bhakti traditions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sufi concept of *Tauhid-i-Wahdat* (Unity of Being), emphasizing the oneness of God and creation, found resonance with the monistic philosophies of some Bhakti saints.
2. The use of vernacular languages like Hindi in Bhakti poetry significantly influenced Sufi literature, leading to a few Sufi poets composing works in Hindi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bhakti and Sufi movements, though originating from different religious backgrounds, shared a surprising degree of convergence in their approaches to spirituality.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this convergence. The Sufi doctrine of *Tauhid-i-Wahdat*, which posits the unity of God and creation, found common ground with the monistic philosophies embraced by several Bhakti saints. Both traditions emphasized the inherent divinity within all beings and the possibility of achieving union with the divine through love and devotion. This philosophical similarity fostered a degree of mutual understanding and exchange of ideas.

Statement 2 also correctly highlights the cultural exchange between the two movements. The Bhakti saints' use of vernacular languages, notably Hindi, in their devotional songs had a significant impact on Sufi literature.  Some Sufi poets, recognizing the accessibility and emotional power of these vernacular forms, adopted them for their works.  Malik Muhammad Jaisi's *Padmavat*, composed in Hindi, is a prime example of this cross-cultural influence, demonstrating the blending of Sufi mysticism with elements of Hindu mythology and symbolism.  Therefore, both statements are accurate representations of the interaction between Sufi and Bhakti traditions. The other options are incorrect as they fail to encompass the depth and breadth of this significant cultural and religious exchange.



**3. With reference to the literary contributions of the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The flourishing of regional languages during this period was primarily due to the patronage of Muslim rulers who actively promoted the translation of Sanskrit works into these languages.
2. The translation of Sanskrit works like the *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata* into regional languages facilitated the wider dissemination of these epics and contributed to their popularity among diverse sections of society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The medieval period in India witnessed a significant shift in literary production, marked by the rise of regional languages and the increasing accessibility of classical works. While Muslim rulers did contribute to the development of Persian and provided some patronage to local languages,  Statement 1 is an oversimplification.  The growth of regional languages was a complex phenomenon driven by various factors, including the Bhakti movement's use of vernacular languages, the increasing literacy among the masses, and the demand for literature in languages that people could understand, irrespective of royal patronage.  The assertion that *Muslim* rulers were the *primary* drivers of Sanskrit translation into regional languages is inaccurate.


Statement 2, however, is accurate. The translation of Sanskrit epics like the *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata* into regional languages played a crucial role in their wider dissemination.  This made the stories and their underlying values accessible to a much larger audience, transcending linguistic and social barriers.  The translations contributed to the popularization of these epics and ensured their continued relevance across diverse communities.  The other options are incorrect because they either overstate the role of Muslim rulers in promoting regional languages or fail to recognize the importance of translating Sanskrit literature into vernacular languages.


**4. With reference to the religious policies of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's policy of *Sulh-i-kul* (universal peace) was primarily aimed at achieving religious harmony and promoting tolerance between Hindus and Muslims.
2. Akbar's religious syncretism, as manifested in the *Ibadat Khana*, was widely accepted by both orthodox Hindu and Muslim scholars, leading to a period of unprecedented religious unity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Akbar's religious policies remain a subject of considerable historical debate. Statement 1 correctly identifies a key objective of his *Sulh-i-kul* policy.  Akbar, recognizing the need for social cohesion in his vast and diverse empire, actively promoted religious tolerance and harmony between Hindus and Muslims. This policy involved various measures, such as the abolition of the *jizya* tax, the inclusion of Hindus in his administration, and the encouragement of interfaith dialogue.  The aim was to create an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, thereby strengthening the unity of his empire.

Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  While Akbar's experiments in religious syncretism through the *Ibadat Khana* (a house of worship where discussions on various religions were held) aimed at fostering religious understanding, it did not achieve universal acceptance.  Orthodox Hindu and Muslim scholars strongly opposed Akbar's syncretic approach, viewing it as a threat to the established religious doctrines and practices.  The *Ibadat Khana* did not lead to a period of undisputed religious unity; instead, it sparked considerable debate and opposition.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is accurate, reflecting the primary goal of Akbar's *Sulh-i-kul* policy.  The other options are incorrect as they either incorrectly portray the reception of Akbar's syncretism or fail to accurately capture the nuances of his religious policies.


**5. With reference to the contributions of  saint-poets during the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The saint-poets primarily used Sanskrit as their medium of expression, ensuring their message reached a wider audience across different regions.
2.  The themes of love and beauty, used allegorically to represent the relationship between the individual soul and God, were a common feature of Bhakti poetry.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bhakti movement's literary output is characterized by its rich devotional poetry. Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sanskrit remained a significant literary language, the Bhakti saint-poets played a crucial role in popularizing vernacular languages like Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, and others. Their choice of vernacular languages was deliberate, aiming to reach a wider audience beyond the elite who were fluent in Sanskrit.  The use of vernacular languages was instrumental in spreading the Bhakti message across various social strata.


Statement 2, however, is entirely accurate. A defining characteristic of Bhakti poetry is the use of themes of love and beauty to represent the spiritual relationship between the individual soul (jiva) and the supreme being (Ishvara).  The poets employed allegorical language, drawing parallels between human love and divine love, making abstract spiritual concepts more accessible and emotionally resonant for their audience.  The love between Radha and Krishna in Vaishnava poetry is a prime example of this allegorical representation of divine love.  Therefore, only Statement 2 is correct, reflecting a key literary characteristic of the Bhakti movement.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the linguistic choices of the Bhakti poets or fail to recognize the central theme of divine love in their poetry.


**1. With reference to the literary contributions during the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abul Fazl's prose writing style significantly influenced subsequent generations of Persian writers, while his brother Faizi oversaw the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian.
2.  Hindu scholars contributed to the growth of Persian literature during this period, alongside Persian poets who migrated to India, notably Utbi and Naziri.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage explicitly states that Abul Fazl's prose style was emulated for generations, establishing his significant influence on Persian prose writing in India.  Furthermore, it clearly mentions Faizi's role in supervising the translation of the Mahabharata, a crucial contribution to the cultural exchange of the time. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the impact of the Mughal era on literary styles and translation efforts.  The statement accurately reflects the key roles played by these two prominent figures in shaping the literary landscape.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text highlights the contribution of Hindu scholars to the flourishing of Persian literature during the Mughal period, alongside the influx of Persian poets from Iran.  The mention of Utbi and Naziri as examples strengthens this point, showcasing the multicultural nature of the Mughal court's literary environment. This aspect is crucial in understanding the complex interplay of different cultural influences that shaped the literary output of the era.  The statement correctly captures the multifaceted nature of literary contributions during this period, emphasizing the participation of both Hindu and Muslim scholars.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The diminishing prestige of Sanskrit, partly due to the decline in Brahmanical influence, created a space for regional languages to flourish.  The Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on reaching the masses, actively utilized vernacular languages in its devotional literature and songs, further accelerating their development and acceptance. This popularization cemented their role in religious and cultural spheres, paving the way for their use in wider contexts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Persian initially held prominence under the Delhi Sultanate, the use of regional languages in administration wasn't entirely suppressed.  Evidence suggests that Hindi-knowing revenue accountants were employed, and later, with the fragmentation of the Sultanate, local languages gained increased usage in regional administrations alongside Persian.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Amir Khusrau, a significant figure in the integration of Perso-Arabic and Indian musical traditions, introduced numerous Perso-Arabic ragas (melodic frameworks) into the existing Indian musical landscape. However, while the invention of the sitar is often attributed to him, there's a lack of definitive historical evidence to confirm this claim.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The tabla, another instrument frequently associated with Amir Khusrau, shows evidence of its actual development much later than his lifetime.  Current scholarship points to the late 17th or early 18th century as the period when the tabla, in its recognizable form, emerged. This demonstrates that while attributions to historical figures can be common, rigorous historical research is essential to ascertain their accuracy.

Prithviraj Chauhan indeed achieved a resounding victory against Muhammad Ghori, but his failure to fully exploit this success proved crucial. He didn't pursue the Ghurids' expulsion from the Punjab, allowing them time to regroup and prepare for a future confrontation. This strategic misstep significantly contributed to the subsequent events.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Second Battle of Tarain, fought in 1192, resulted in the complete defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan and his forces. This battle is widely recognized as a watershed moment in Indian history, marking the beginning of the establishment of lasting Turkish rule in North India.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

He actively challenged the rigid caste system prevalent in Hindu society by accepting disciples from all castes, including those considered low-caste at the time. This inclusiveness was a hallmark of his teachings, reflecting the movement's broader aim of spiritual equality.

Statement 2 is also correct. Kabir, another significant figure of the Bhakti movement, famously criticized the orthodox practices and rituals of both Hinduism and Islam.  He stressed the fundamental unity of God, irrespective of the names used to refer to the divine, and rejected idol worship, pilgrimages, and other formal religious observances. His emphasis was on direct spiritual experience rather than outward displays of piety.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Aurangzeb faced numerous rebellions from the Jats, a predominantly agrarian community in the Agra-Delhi region. These uprisings stemmed from various factors, including issues related to land revenue collection and social injustices. While not solely religiously motivated, religious elements did play a part in mobilizing and shaping the Jat resistance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Afghan uprisings in the northwest were indeed partly tribal, rooted in the fierce independence of the various Afghan tribes. However, the uprisings also had religious dimensions, influenced by religious revivalist movements like the Raushanai movement which provided an ideological framework for the resistance.  Therefore, reducing the Afghan uprisings solely to tribal conflicts overlooks the significant religious factors involved.

The diminishing dominance of Sanskrit, partly due to the decline of Brahmanical authority, created space for vernacular languages to gain prominence.  This wasn't a sudden shift, but a gradual process facilitated by various factors.  The rise of regional kingdoms and their administrative needs also played a role, as regional languages were increasingly used for governance.  Statement 2 focuses on the cultural aspect.  The Bhakti movement's emphasis on accessibility and direct engagement with the divine actively promoted the use of vernacular languages.  Saints like Kabir, Tulsidas, and others composed in the languages understood by the masses, thereby fostering literary creativity and shaping the linguistic landscape.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect important literary developments in medieval India. Statement 1 correctly identifies Nusrat Shah's patronage of literary translations.

This translation effort highlights the growing acceptance and importance of regional languages in the literary sphere.  Statement 2 accurately describes the allegorical nature of Jaisi's Padmavat.  Written in medieval Hindi (Awadhi), this work uses the historical backdrop of Alauddin Khalji's siege of Chittor as a framework to explore Sufi themes of love, devotion, and the relationship between the individual soul and the divine.  The use of a historical narrative to convey Sufi ideas reflects the syncretic nature of the period's cultural and religious landscape.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while (d) is entirely incorrect.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This inclusive approach was a significant departure from traditional norms and contributed to the movement's widespread appeal. Statement 2 accurately portrays Kabir's critical stance on traditional Hindu practices.  Known for his radical views, Kabir openly criticized aspects of orthodox Hinduism that he considered superficial or contradictory to his philosophy of devotion.  His rejection of idol worship, pilgrimages, and ritualistic practices reflected a desire for a more direct and personal relationship with the divine, transcending established religious norms. His inclusive message extended to Muslims as well.  Therefore, both statements accurately depict important facets of the Bhakti movement. Options (a) and (b) offer only partial truths, while (d) is completely false.

His reign in Kashmir witnessed the translation of the *Mahabharata* and *Rajatarangini* (Kalhana's chronicle of Kashmir) into Persian. This act reflects the ruler's commitment to promoting cultural exchange and fostering intellectual interaction between different linguistic and cultural traditions. The translations showcase the ruler’s progressive attitude and the integration of different cultural practices.  Options (a) and (b) are partially correct, while (d) is incorrect.

The vastness of his empire and its diverse composition are significant factors in understanding the subsequent political developments in the region. Statement 2 correctly describes the challenges Babur faced in his early campaigns.  Babur, a Timurid prince, made several attempts to regain control of Samarqand, his ancestral homeland.  However, his ambitions were consistently thwarted by the Uzbek chief, Shaibani Khan, a powerful figure who played a pivotal role in the shifting power dynamics of Central Asia. Shaibani Khan’s intervention forced Babur to shift his focus towards India. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while (d) is entirely false.

This inclusive policy was a departure from strict adherence to religious lines in administration and reflects a more pragmatic and integrated approach to governance. This policy contributed to the stability and prosperity of the kingdom. Statement 2 correctly describes a key military achievement of his reign.

A strong navy was crucial to maintain this influence.  Statement 2 accurately portrays the grandeur of Vijayanagara city.

Note that the difficulty level is subjective and depends on the examinee's prior knowledge.  I have aimed for a "difficult" level by incorporating plausible distractors and requiring nuanced understanding.

Statement 1 correctly captures his identity as a Marathi poet and his cross-cultural engagement.  Statement 2 accurately portrays Ramananda's inclusive approach to Bhakti, defying traditional caste hierarchies by accepting disciples from all varnas, including the lower castes. This inclusive philosophy was a significant characteristic of the Bhakti movement, challenging the rigid caste system prevalent in medieval India. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accurate portrayal of both figures and their roles within the broader context of the Bhakti movement.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect historical trends.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the socio-political context that facilitated the rise of the Nath Panthi movement. The weakening of Rajput power and Brahmanical authority created a space for alternative religious and social ideologies, and the Sufi emphasis on equality resonated with the existing discontent. Statement 2 accurately describes Kabir's teachings, highlighting his emphasis on monotheism, his rejection of traditional Hindu rituals, and his unconventional approach to spiritual life, which rejected both extreme asceticism and rigid adherence to scriptures. The uncertainty surrounding Kabir's early life is also a well-documented aspect of his biography. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete as they fail to recognize the validity of both statements in describing the socio-religious dynamics of medieval India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately represent key aspects of Guru Nanak's life and teachings.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the similarities between Nanak's and Kabir's teachings, focusing on their shared emphasis on monotheism, rejection of ritualistic practices, and their pragmatic approach to spiritual life, balancing religious devotion with the responsibilities of everyday existence.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaishavite movement encompassed the worship of multiple incarnations of Vishnu, including both Rama and Krishna.  The movement's diversity is a crucial aspect of its understanding.  Statement 2 is correct.  Many Vaishavite poets employed the Radha-Krishna narrative as a powerful metaphor for the spiritual journey and the devotee's relationship with God. This allegorical use of mythology was a common feature of the Bhakti movement, making religious concepts more accessible and emotionally resonant. The inclusion of Mirabai highlights the movement's diverse geographical reach and the participation of women. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to accurately reflect the scope and characteristics of the Vaishavite movement.

Akbar's patronage of such projects underscores his policy of religious tolerance and cultural synthesis.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe distinct but interconnected socio-religious movements. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Lingayat movement's founders, its opposition to the caste system, and its progressive social reforms.  The movement's challenge to traditional social norms was significant in the context of medieval India. Statement 2 accurately portrays the Bhakti movement in South India, emphasizing its devotional focus, its inclusive nature, and its subtle yet impactful approach to social reform. While not overtly rejecting the caste system, the Bhakti movement's emphasis on devotion created a more egalitarian spiritual space.

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly reflect aspects of Akbar's reign and its impact. Statement 1 accurately identifies the influence of Kabir and Nanak's teachings on Akbar's policy of *sulh-i-kul*, which aimed at establishing religious harmony and tolerance within his empire.  This policy was a key feature of Akbar's rule.  Statement 2 correctly identifies Abul Fazl's literary contribution and Faizi's role in the significant translation project of the Mahabharata, demonstrating Akbar's patronage of both Hindu and Muslim scholars and his efforts in promoting intercultural exchange.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete as they fail to recognize the combined significance of both statements in illuminating the cultural and religious policies of Akbar's reign.



**9. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The war of succession among Shah Jahan's sons, lacking a clear tradition of succession, weakened the empire.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The lack of a clear succession system within the Mughal dynasty led to a protracted and devastating war among Shah Jahan's sons, significantly weakening the empire's internal stability and paving the way for its eventual decline.  This internal conflict diverted resources and eroded the empire’s authority.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb presented himself as a champion of orthodoxy, his victory wasn't solely based on religious support.  Political maneuvering, military prowess, and alliances played equally crucial roles in his triumph.  His success was a complex interplay of factors, not simply religious appeal. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**10. With reference to the literary landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Amir Khusrau, a prolific writer, wrote primarily in Arabic and contributed significantly to the development of Arabic literature in India.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

(a) Alamgirnama
(b) Razmanama

**Explanation:** The Razmanama is a 16th-century Persian translation of the Mahabharata commissioned during the reign of Akbar.  Options (a), (c), and (d) represent other historical texts, but not translations of the Mahabharata.  The Razmanama is significant for its illustration of the synthesis of Indian and Persian artistic and cultural traditions during the Mughal period.  Understanding the context of this translation is crucial for appreciating the cultural exchange and patronage of arts during Akbar's reign.  It's important to note that while other Persian translations and adaptations of Indian epics might exist, the Razmanama holds a unique place in history due to its scale and the historical period in which it was created.


**2.  In which of the following texts does the list of the sixteen great states (Shodasha Mahajanapadas) of ancient India occur?**

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:** The Anguttara Nikaya, Digha Nikaya, and Bhagavati Sutra all contain references to the sixteen Mahajanapadas.  The Arthashastra, while a significant text on ancient Indian polity and economics, doesn't explicitly list all sixteen Mahajanapadas. The presence of this list in Buddhist and Jain canonical texts highlights the importance of these kingdoms within the broader socio-political landscape of ancient India.  Understanding the geographical distribution and relative power of these Mahajanapadas is essential for comprehending the political and economic dynamics of the period.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of primary sources related to ancient Indian history and their ability to differentiate between sources that directly mention the Mahajanapadas and those that don't.

He also adopted a more public and aristocratic lifestyle to increase the movement's reach and influence.  This shift in approach was strategic in promoting the growth and visibility of Sikhism. Statement 2 correctly identifies the shared characteristics of Bhakti and Sufi movements.  Both movements emphasized a direct relationship with the divine, bypassing traditional religious hierarchies. This emphasis on personal devotion created an environment conducive to religious tolerance and interaction between different faiths.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

This approach was more effective than purely military means in achieving a degree of political stability and cooperation with Rajput rulers. Statement 2 accurately explains the aftermath of the Battle of Haldighati. Although the Mughals achieved a tactical victory at Haldighati, they failed to completely subdue Rana Pratap.  Rana Pratap, despite the loss, continued his resistance through guerilla warfare, highlighting the limitations of Mughal military dominance in facing determined resistance. This prolonged struggle demonstrates the tenacity of Rajput resistance and the challenges of consolidating control in the face of determined opposition.  Both statements, therefore, are correct, and the answer is (c).

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

The kingdom's patronage of arts and learning contributed to this cultural fusion. Statement 2 accurately points to the significance of the Battle of Talikota. The battle marked a turning point, signifying the decline of the Vijayanagara empire.  This event created a power vacuum in south India, paving the way for the independent sultanates of the Deccan to gain prominence.  The disintegration of Vijayanagara significantly altered the political landscape of the south and facilitated the rise of these successor states.  Therefore, both statements are historically accurate, leading to (c) as the correct answer.

This indicates a level of intellectual curiosity and a desire to understand the beliefs and practices of the Hindu population. This initiative, though limited in scope, shows a pragmatic approach to governance, recognizing the need to understand the diverse cultural landscape of his kingdom. Statement 2 correctly points to the unintended consequences of his economic policies. Firuz Tughlaq's economic policies, while aiming at improvement, had the unintended consequence of creating a large and powerful slave corps.  This slave army, while initially intended to enhance his military power and loyalty, ultimately became a source of instability within the Sultanate.  The slaves, forming a powerful interest group, became involved in the power struggles following Firuz Tughlaq's death, contributing to the Sultanate's weakening.  Both statements are accurate, therefore the answer is (c).


**1. With reference to the development of regional languages in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the historical context of regional language development in medieval India.

The Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on reaching a wider audience through accessible language, played a crucial role in popularizing and shaping these regional languages for literary expression.  The saints' adoption of vernaculars for their devotional poetry and prose had a profound impact on their standardization and literary usage.  

Statement 2 also holds true. The Delhi Sultanate's administrative policies, including the use of Hindi in revenue accounting, demonstrate the practical application of regional languages beyond religious contexts.  This official recognition helped solidify their place in society.  Furthermore, the patronage of some Muslim rulers towards regional literary works, such as the translation of the Mahabharata and Ramayana into Bengali under Nusrat Shah, actively promoted their development and refinement. This patronage highlights the cultural exchange and integration that occurred during this period, showcasing how regional languages became important vehicles for both religious and secular expression.  The combined effect of these factors led to the significant rise and maturity of various regional languages in medieval India.


**2. With reference to the influence of Persian music on Indian classical music, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the significant influence of Persian music on the development of Indian classical music during the medieval period. Statement 1 correctly highlights Amir Khusrau's crucial role. His contributions extended beyond literature; he was a master musician who introduced numerous Perso-Arabic ragas (melodic frameworks) into the Indian system.  While the claim of his inventing the sitar lacks definitive historical evidence, his influence on the evolution of Indian musical instruments and styles is undeniable.  His integration of Perso-Arabic musical elements represents a key moment in the fusion of musical traditions.

Statement 2 further elaborates on the continuation of this musical exchange. Firuz Shah Tughlaq's regular attendance at musical gatherings, and his reign witnessing the Persian translation of the Indian classical work *Ragadarpan*, showcases the royal patronage and interest in the blending of musical styles.  Similarly, Raja Man Singh of Gwalior’s commissioning of *Mari Kautuhal*, a work documenting the new musical modes introduced by the Muslims, indicates a systematic effort to record and preserve this evolving musical landscape. This patronage, along with the spread of musical gatherings from Sufi circles to noble courts, demonstrates the ongoing process of cultural integration and the enduring impact of Perso-Arabic influences on Indian music.


**3. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement, spearheaded by figures like Kabir and Nanak, significantly challenged the rigidity of the caste system, though it didn't entirely dismantle it, and promoted a message of Hindu-Muslim unity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Bhakti movement and its influence. Statement 1 correctly points out the movement's challenge to the caste system.  Kabir and Nanak, along with other Bhakti saints, actively preached against social discrimination and untouchability, promoting a more inclusive and egalitarian vision. While they didn't fully eradicate the caste system, their teachings significantly softened its rigid structure and fostered a sense of unity among different castes and communities. The emphasis on devotion to God as a path to salvation, independent of caste, was a revolutionary concept.  Their message also transcended religious boundaries, promoting harmony between Hindus and Muslims, a theme particularly evident in Kabir's teachings.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Vaishnava branch's use of the Radha-Krishna allegory.  The saint-poets of this branch, including Surdas, Mirabai, and Chaitanya, creatively employed the love story of Radha and Krishna as a powerful metaphor for the mystical union between the individual soul (jivatma) and the supreme soul (paramatma). This allegorical approach made complex spiritual concepts accessible and relatable to a wide audience, fostering deep emotional engagement with the divine.  This poetic and devotional tradition enriched both religious and literary landscapes, leaving an enduring legacy on Indian culture. The combination of social reform and sophisticated religious expression makes the Bhakti movement a significant period in Indian history.

The statement accurately notes the significant contribution of Hindu scholars and writers to Persian literature during this period, highlighting the cultural exchange and integration taking place.  This fusion of styles and perspectives enriched the literary landscape.

The translations of major epics into these languages further broadened their reach and solidified their role in cultural expression.  The combined effect of these trends created a rich and diverse literary landscape during the Mughal era.


**5. With reference to the political dynamics of the early Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  The early Delhi Sultanate faced continuous challenges in maintaining control over its eastern territories (Bengal and Bihar), with frequent assertions of independence by local governors and ongoing struggles against local rulers like those in Orissa.
2.  The Sultanate’s western and southern frontiers were also insecure, marked by Rajput revolts and the need to constantly reassert control over territories in eastern Rajasthan, while efforts to expand into Gujarat and Malwa often met with resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the unstable political landscape faced by the early Delhi Sultanate.  Statement 1 correctly describes the ongoing struggles in the east.  The Sultanate repeatedly faced challenges in retaining control over Bengal and Bihar.  Local governors frequently asserted their independence, exploiting moments of weakness in Delhi.  Simultaneously, the Sultanate engaged in protracted conflicts with powerful regional rulers in Orissa, highlighting the difficulties in extending and maintaining control over distant territories.  The Sultanate's efforts to impose its authority were met with persistent resistance, showcasing the limitations of its power and the strength of regional loyalties.

Statement 2 accurately details the insecurity on the western and southern frontiers.  The Sultanate’s control over eastern Rajasthan was constantly threatened by Rajput uprisings.  Various Rajput principalities frequently revolted against the Sultanate's rule, demonstrating the challenges of subduing and integrating this region.  The attempts to extend the Sultanate’s influence into Gujarat and Malwa were also met with significant resistance from strong local rulers.  These powerful kingdoms successfully repelled numerous incursions, demonstrating the limitations of the Sultanate's military reach and the resilience of established regional powers.  The combined challenges in the east and west underscore the Sultanate's difficulties in consolidating its power and establishing a secure, unified empire.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', requiring in-depth knowledge and careful analysis of nuanced details.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on austere practices and formal Vedic worship, aiming to restrict participation to the upper castes.
2.  The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, actively opposed the caste system and certain traditional Hindu rituals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement, particularly in South India, directly contradicted the emphasis on austere practices and formal Vedic rituals.  The Alvars and Nayanmars, key figures in the Bhakti movement, rejected austerities and promoted a path of devotion accessible to all castes, emphasizing a loving bond between the devotee and God.  Their use of Tamil, a vernacular language, further broadened accessibility.  The statement misrepresents the core tenets of Bhakti as elitist and ritualistic when it was, in fact, a populist and emotionally driven movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lingayat or Virashaiva movement, founded by Basava and his nephew Channabasava, explicitly challenged the caste system and rejected traditional Hindu practices like elaborate fasts, feasts, pilgrimages, and sacrifices. They promoted social reforms such as opposing child marriage and allowing widow remarriage.  Their emphasis on equality and rejection of hierarchical rituals aligns perfectly with the movement's known historical context.


**2. With reference to the impact of the Bhakti and Sufi movements on medieval Indian society, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both movements successfully eradicated the caste system and established complete religious harmony between Hindus and Muslims.
2. The humanistic and egalitarian ideals of Kabir and Nanak significantly influenced Akbar's religious policies, promoting a climate of religious tolerance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both the Bhakti and Sufi movements advocated for social equality and challenged caste rigidity, they did not entirely eliminate the caste system.  Although they softened its rigors by making religious paths accessible to all, the entrenched societal structure of caste persisted, albeit with a modified influence.  Complete religious harmony, while a goal of these movements, remained elusive due to the continued existence of orthodox factions within both Hinduism and Islam.

Statement 2 is correct. The non-sectarian philosophies of Kabir and Nanak, emphasizing the unity of God and rejecting ritualistic practices, had a profound impact on Akbar's religious and political views.  Akbar's policy of *sulh-i-kul* (universal peace) and his promotion of religious tolerance clearly reflect the influence of these saints' egalitarian and inclusive ideals. This is evident in Akbar’s efforts to bridge the gap between different religious communities, although his policies were also met with resistance from orthodox elements.


**3. With reference to the religious and cultural landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of the worship of Shiva and Vishnu during the medieval period led to the complete suppression of local and tribal deities, resulting in a homogenized religious practice.
2.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy posed a significant intellectual challenge to Buddhism and Jainism, contributing to the revival and expansion of Hinduism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the prominence of Shiva and Vishnu during the medieval period is undeniable,  it didn't lead to the complete suppression of local and tribal deities. Instead, a process of cultural synthesis occurred. Many local and tribal deities were incorporated into the broader Hindu pantheon, often becoming subordinate to Shiva or Vishnu, rather than being eliminated entirely.  This demonstrates the complex interplay between established religious traditions and local beliefs, resulting in a more syncretic religious landscape.

Statement 2 is correct. Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with its emphasis on the non-dual nature of reality and the oneness of Brahman, presented a powerful philosophical counterpoint to Buddhism and Jainism.  His philosophical system provided a strong intellectual framework for the revival and expansion of Hinduism, offering a cohesive and systematic response to the challenges posed by other religious traditions.  This contributed significantly to the resurgence of Hinduism's influence during the medieval period.


**4. With reference to the political and military aspects of the early Turkish conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ghurid conquest of India was primarily driven by a desire for religious conversion, resulting in widespread forced conversions and destruction of Hindu temples.
2.  The battle of Tarain (1192) marked a decisive turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and the beginning of sustained Turkish rule in North India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ghurid conquests were undertaken by Muslim rulers, the primary motivation was not solely religious conversion.  While temple destruction and plunder occurred, these actions were largely driven by political and economic motives—the acquisition of wealth, resources, and control over strategic territories.  The conquests were characterized by a mix of military campaigns and political maneuvering, not a systematic campaign of religious conversion on a mass scale.

Statement 2 is correct. The second battle of Tarain (1192) was indeed a pivotal moment in Indian history.  The Ghurid victory under Muizzuddin Muhammad decisively shifted the balance of power, leading to the eventual establishment of the Delhi Sultanate. This marked the beginning of a long period of sustained Turkish rule in North India, profoundly impacting the political, social, and cultural landscape of the region.  The battle's significance lies in its lasting consequences, rather than just the immediate military outcome.


**5. With reference to the literary and cultural contributions of the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1. The use of regional languages in literature during the medieval period was primarily a result of the deliberate suppression of Sanskrit by Muslim rulers.
2. Amir Khusrau, a prominent figure of the Delhi Sultanate, significantly contributed to the development of a unique Indo-Persian literary style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rise of regional languages in literature wasn't due to the deliberate suppression of Sanskrit.  While the decline of Sanskrit's dominance among certain segments of society occurred, it was a complex process influenced by various factors, including the rise of vernacular languages, the patronage of regional rulers, and the popularity of Bhakti saints who used vernacular languages to spread their message.  Muslim rulers did not systematically suppress Sanskrit; in fact, many patronized Sanskrit learning and scholarship.

Statement 2 is correct. Amir Khusrau's contributions to literature are well-documented.  He played a crucial role in developing a distinct Indo-Persian literary style, blending Persian forms with Indian themes and sensibilities. His writings reflect his deep connection to India and his embrace of Indian culture. His work also incorporated elements of Hindi, showcasing his contribution to the amalgamation of Indian and Persian literary traditions.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nath Panthi movement primarily focused on challenging the caste system and the dominance of Brahmins.
2. The Satnami movement, primarily composed of peasants and artisans, strictly adhered to a caste-based social hierarchy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nath Panthi movement, arising during a period of weakening Brahminical authority, directly challenged the rigid caste system and the privileged position of Brahmins.  It promoted a more egalitarian social order, aligning with the broader trend of Bhakti and Sufi movements that questioned traditional hierarchies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Satnami movement, while primarily composed of peasants and artisans, notably *rejected* caste distinctions and hierarchical structures.  Their emphasis on a strict code of conduct transcended the traditional Hindu social order, embracing a more inclusive and egalitarian ethos.  This directly contradicts the statement's assertion of adherence to a caste-based hierarchy.  The movement's inclusive nature is a crucial point to remember for UPSC.


**2. With reference to the religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dilwara Temple at Mount Abu is a significant example of the architectural patronage extended to Jainism during the Chalukya period.
2.  The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola, erected during the ninth and tenth centuries, depicts Mahavira engaged in intense physical austerities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Jainism's flourishing during the medieval period in India. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Dilwara Temple as a prime example of the magnificent Jain temples built under the patronage of the Chalukya rulers of Gujarat, showcasing the significant architectural achievements of the era.  This highlights the intersection of political power and religious patronage, a key theme in UPSC examinations.

Statement 2 is also correct. The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola, a remarkable feat of sculpture, indeed depicts a Jain saint (Gomateshwara, not Mahavira) in a posture of rigorous austerities, unmindful of the surrounding elements. The statue’s scale and artistic merit underscore the religious fervor and artistic capabilities of the period.  Understanding the iconography and significance of such monumental sculptures is important for the UPSC.


**3. With reference to the Bhakti movement in South India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Alvars and Nayanmars were primarily associated with the worship of Shiva and Vishnu, respectively.
2.  Andal, a prominent woman saint, actively opposed the caste system through her teachings and actions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While both Alvars and Nayanmars were integral to the Bhakti movement in South India, the Alvars were primarily devoted to Vishnu, while the Nayanmars were devoted to Shiva. The statement incorrectly reverses their primary deities.  Precise details about the distinct characteristics of these two groups are crucial for UPSC-level understanding.

Statement 2 is correct. Andal, a highly revered woman saint of the Alvars, while not explicitly opposing the caste system in a direct, organized manner, her teachings and actions implicitly challenged social inequalities by emphasizing the universality of divine love and devotion, making the path of bhakti accessible to all regardless of caste.  This subtle yet significant challenge to the social order is a key insight for UPSC.


**4. With reference to the intellectual challenges to Buddhism and Jainism in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Shankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy directly challenged the core tenets of Jainism’s Anekantavada (theory of multiple perspectives).
2. Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) sought to reconcile the path of Bhakti with the Vedic tradition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the intellectual landscape of medieval India. Statement 1 is correct because Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with its emphasis on the ultimate unity of Brahman (ultimate reality), directly countered the Jain concept of Anekantavada, which posits the existence of multiple perspectives and truths.  This highlights the philosophical debates that shaped religious thought during this era—a recurring theme in UPSC questions.

Statement 2 is also correct. Ramanuja, a prominent figure in the development of the Bhakti movement, indeed aimed to synthesize the path of devotion (Bhakti) with the established Vedic tradition.  His Vishishtadvaita philosophy attempted to reconcile the seemingly contradictory concepts of monism and the distinct existence of individual souls, thus bridging the gap between popular religious practices and orthodox Vedic thought.  Understanding the nuances of these philosophical schools is vital for UPSC success.


**5. With reference to the Mughal Empire’s internal conflicts, consider the following statements:**

1.  The war of succession following Shah Jahan's illness primarily involved a conflict between Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb, with other princes also vying for power.
2.  Raja Jaswant Singh, ruler of Jodhpur, remained a steadfast ally of Dara Shikoh throughout the war of succession.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The war of succession that unfolded after Shah Jahan's illness was indeed dominated by the conflict between Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb, although other princes like Shuja and Murad also participated, making it a complex multi-faceted struggle for power. This highlights the instability inherent in the Mughal succession system, a significant factor in the empire's eventual decline—a common topic in UPSC questions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Raja Jaswant Singh initially supported Dara Shikoh, he later switched allegiance to Aurangzeb, influenced by strategic considerations and promises of rewards and concessions.  This shift in alliances underscores the pragmatic nature of Rajput politics during this period and their willingness to adapt their alliances based on perceived advantages, a point frequently tested in UPSC exams.


**6. With reference to the religious policies of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mahzar was a document signed by leading Islamic scholars affirming Akbar's right to interpret religious matters.
2.  The Ibadat Khana, initially intended to foster religious harmony, ultimately led to increased religious tensions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect Akbar's religious policies and their outcomes. Statement 1 is correct. The Mahzar was indeed a significant document where leading Islamic scholars acknowledged Akbar's authority in matters of religious interpretation, aiming to resolve religious conflicts within the empire.  This showcases Akbar’s attempts to manage religious diversity within a centralized state—a recurrent UPSC theme.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Ibadat Khana, though initially conceived as a space for interfaith dialogue, ultimately resulted in heightened religious tensions due to the debates that often devolved into acrimonious disagreements and mutual condemnations.  This highlights the limitations of Akbar’s approach to religious harmony and the persistent strength of religious orthodoxy in the society—a point of considerable importance for UPSC.


**7. With reference to the socio-religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries, consider the following statements:**

1. Kabir's teachings emphasized the unity of God and rejected idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious practices.
2. Guru Nanak, while advocating monotheism, strictly adhered to the traditional Hindu caste system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kabir's teachings were indeed characterized by a strong emphasis on the unity of God (regardless of the name used—Allah, Ram, etc.), a rejection of ritualistic practices prevalent in both Hinduism and Islam, and a focus on the inner spiritual experience.  This highlights his syncretic approach to religion, which influenced subsequent religious movements—a common UPSC area of study.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Guru Nanak, while also advocating monotheism and the importance of inner spiritual purity, significantly challenged the Hindu caste system by emphasizing equality before God and rejecting caste-based discrimination.  This underscores the socio-religious reformist aspects of his teachings, leading to the establishment of Sikhism—a critical point for UPSC understanding.


**8. With reference to the cultural synthesis in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sufi movement, through its interaction with Hindu yogis and mystics, incorporated elements of Indian mysticism into its practices and beliefs.
2.  The translation of Sanskrit texts into Persian and vice versa played a minimal role in fostering cultural exchange during the period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sufi movement's interaction with Hindu yogis and mystics played a crucial role in the cultural synthesis of medieval India.  Sufi saints often engaged in dialogues and shared practices with Hindu mystics, leading to a reciprocal exchange of ideas and beliefs, creating a climate of religious tolerance and mutual understanding. This is a frequent topic in UPSC examinations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The translation of Sanskrit texts into Persian and vice versa was a significant factor in promoting cultural exchange during the period.  This facilitated the dissemination of knowledge and ideas across religious and linguistic boundaries, contributing to a greater understanding and appreciation of different cultural traditions.  This underscores the role of intellectual and cultural exchange in shaping the socio-religious landscape of medieval India, a vital aspect for UPSC preparation.


**9. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid conquests under Muhammad Ghori significantly altered the political landscape of North India, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.
2.  The Rajput rulers offered unified and unwavering resistance against the Turkish invasions, preventing any significant territorial losses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Ghurid conquests, culminating in the victories at the battles of Tarain, marked a pivotal moment in Indian history.  These conquests not only weakened existing Rajput kingdoms but also laid the foundation for the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, initiating a new era of political and cultural transformation in North India, a crucial development in UPSC history.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Rajput rulers did offer significant resistance to the Turkish invasions at various points, their resistance was not unified or unwavering.  Internal conflicts and varying levels of cooperation among different Rajput states often hindered their collective efforts, resulting in significant territorial losses to the Turks.  Understanding the dynamics of Rajput resistance and the factors that contributed to their inability to effectively counter the Turkish advance is vital for UPSC.


**10. With reference to the economic and social structures of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kayastha caste emerged as a distinct social group during this period, encompassing individuals from diverse caste backgrounds who served in royal administrations.
2. The position of the Dalits (untouchables) significantly improved during this period, with increased access to land ownership and social mobility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kayastha caste did emerge as a distinct social group during the medieval period, comprising individuals from various caste backgrounds who initially served in royal and administrative positions.  Over time, they solidified their identity as a separate caste, reflecting the fluidity and evolving nature of the caste system during this era—a theme often explored in UPSC.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The condition of the Dalits (untouchables) did not improve significantly during this period.  They continued to face social stigma, discrimination, and limited access to resources and opportunities, often being excluded from land ownership and other aspects of societal participation.  The persistence of untouchability and the challenges faced by Dalits remain a crucial element in understanding the complexities of Indian social history for UPSC.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Shiva and Vishnu, rejecting severe ascetic practices and emphasizing a personal bond of love between the devotee and the deity.
2. The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava, vehemently opposed the caste system, child marriage, and advocated widow remarriage, while emphasizing the worship of Shiva.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhakti movement, particularly in South India with the Alvars and Nayanmars, centered on the worship of Shiva and Vishnu.  It emphasized bhakti (devotion) as a path to salvation, rejecting rigorous asceticism in favor of a loving relationship with the divine.  The saints used vernacular languages, making their message accessible to all castes.  While they didn't directly challenge the caste system, their emphasis on love and devotion transcended caste barriers, opening the path to salvation for all.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Lingayat or Virashaiva movement, founded by Basava in Karnataka, was a significant socio-religious reform movement.  It directly challenged the caste system, advocating for social equality and rejecting traditional rituals like pilgrimages and sacrifices.  The movement also promoted progressive social reforms, including opposition to child marriage and permission for widow remarriage.  The focus was on the worship of Shiva, but with a distinct rejection of Brahmanical orthodoxy.  Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of these influential movements.  Option (c) is therefore the most appropriate choice.


**2. With reference to the decline of Buddhism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The assimilation of Buddhist concepts and deities into existing Hindu traditions, particularly Vaishnavism, gradually led to the absorption of Buddhism into Hinduism.
2.  The patronage of Jainism by several ruling dynasties, particularly in Gujarat and Karnataka, diverted resources and attention away from Buddhism, contributing to its decline.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The gradual decline of Buddhism in India wasn't solely due to persecution, but also a process of syncretism.  Buddhist concepts and even figures like Buddha himself were gradually incorporated into the broader Hindu religious framework. The identification of Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu is a prime example of this process, ultimately weakening Buddhism's distinct identity and leading to its absorption. This process of assimilation made it difficult to distinguish Buddhism from Hinduism, effectively leading to its decline as a separate religious entity.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Jainism did receive significant royal patronage, leading to impressive temple construction and a continued presence, this doesn't directly explain the decline of Buddhism.  The two religions coexisted, and the success of Jainism doesn't automatically imply the downfall of Buddhism.  The primary factor was the gradual absorption of Buddhism into Hinduism, a process not directly linked to the flourishing of Jainism. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, making (a) the correct answer.


**3. With reference to the religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sufi movement emphasized meditation, control of breath, and recitation of holy songs to induce ecstasy, attracting a diverse following across caste lines.
2.  The Tantric movement in North India, similarly open to all castes, offered a path to spiritual realization that involved practices distinct from Vedic orthodoxy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sufi mystics, a branch of Islam, employed a range of practices to achieve spiritual enlightenment.  These included meditation (muraqaba), control of breath (riyaza), and the recitation of devotional songs (sama') that aimed to create a state of ecstasy in both the practitioner and the audience.  Significantly, the Sufi movement often transcended caste distinctions, attracting followers from various social groups, which contributed to its popularity.  Their emphasis on direct experience of the divine resonated with many who found traditional religious structures restrictive.


Statement 2 is also correct.  The Tantric movement in North India represented a significant departure from traditional Vedic practices. While incorporating elements of Hinduism, it offered a path open to all castes, irrespective of social standing.  Tantric practices focused on various rituals and techniques, often involving the manipulation of energy and the use of mantras and yantras, to achieve spiritual liberation.  This alternative path appealed to those seeking a more direct and less restrictive approach to spirituality than that provided by orthodox Brahmanical Hinduism.  Therefore, both statements accurately represent key features of these movements, making (c) the correct option.


**4. With reference to the early medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola, depicting a Jain saint in a state of rigorous austerity, exemplifies the enduring popularity of Jainism amongst certain communities.
2. The construction of magnificent Jain temples, such as the Dilwara temple at Mount Abu, showcases the patronage extended to Jainism by certain ruling dynasties, particularly the Chalukyas of Gujarat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The massive statue of Gomateshwara at Sravana Belgola in Karnataka is a powerful testament to the continued strength of Jainism, especially within specific communities.  The statue's depiction of a Jain saint engaged in severe penance highlights the importance of asceticism within the Jain faith and its ability to inspire devotion among its followers. The sheer scale of the statue speaks volumes about the community’s dedication and resources.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu, built during the reign of the Chalukya dynasty in Gujarat, are architectural marvels that underscore the royal patronage enjoyed by Jainism.  These temples, renowned for their intricate carvings and exquisite craftsmanship, represent a high point of Jain art and architecture. This patronage played a vital role in the continued flourishing of Jainism during this period, demonstrating the faith’s influence and the support it received from powerful rulers.  Both statements highlight important aspects of Jainism's presence and influence in the early medieval period, making (c) the correct answer.


**5.  With reference to the political and religious developments in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rise of the Bhakti movement led to the conversion of many Buddhists and Jains to Hinduism, expanding Hinduism’s reach and influence.
2.  The Bhakti movement’s emphasis on love and devotion, accessible to all castes, weakened the rigid caste system and contributed to a greater sense of social inclusivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on accessible devotional practices, played a significant role in attracting followers from other religious traditions.  Many Buddhists and Jains, drawn to the movement's emphasis on personal devotion and the direct path to God, were absorbed into the Hindu fold. This expansion of Hinduism was facilitated by the movement’s broad appeal and its message of inclusivity, which resonated with many who felt alienated from more rigid religious structures.


Statement 2 is also correct. While the Bhakti movement didn't abolish the caste system, its inclusive ethos significantly challenged its rigidity.  The saints’ emphasis on love and devotion as the primary criteria for spiritual attainment undermined the traditional emphasis on birth-based social hierarchies.  By welcoming individuals from all castes into their fold, the Bhakti movement created a space for greater social inclusivity and challenged the entrenched power of the Brahmanical order.  The movement’s impact on social attitudes towards caste was profound, contributing to a gradual erosion of its strictures, even if the system itself persisted. Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer.


**6. With reference to the Ghaznavid conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's raids were primarily motivated by the acquisition of wealth from rich temples and towns, rather than a systematic attempt at territorial conquest.
2. The Hindushahi rulers of the Punjab offered strong resistance to Mahmud's initial incursions, but ultimately succumbed to his superior military strength and strategies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mahmud of Ghazni's numerous raids into India were largely focused on plunder.  While he certainly demonstrated military prowess, his primary objective in these expeditions was the acquisition of immense wealth from the rich temples and cities of India. He did not initially aim to establish a lasting political control over the conquered territories. His raids were characterized by swift attacks, the seizure of valuable resources, and a subsequent retreat to his base in Ghazni.  This focus on plunder shaped the nature of his interactions with India, leaving a legacy of destruction and violence.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Hindushahi kingdom, ruling over parts of the Punjab, initially posed a formidable challenge to Mahmud's ambitions.  They engaged in several battles against his forces, demonstrating their military capabilities and determination to defend their territory.  However, despite their resistance, the Hindushahis eventually fell to Mahmud's superior military strength and strategic acumen.  The combination of their own internal weaknesses and Mahmud's relentless attacks ultimately led to the collapse of their kingdom, paving the way for further Ghaznavid incursions into India.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Ghaznavid conquests, making (c) the correct answer.


**7. With reference to the socio-political dynamics of the Mughal empire under Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's religious policies, aimed at promoting Islamic orthodoxy, alienated a significant segment of the Hindu population, contributing to widespread unrest and rebellion.
2. The crisis of the jagirdari system, characterized by a growing gap between the paper income of jagirs and their actual realization, weakened the Mughal nobility and destabilized the empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aurangzeb’s reign witnessed a shift towards a more rigid interpretation of Islamic law and a stricter application of religious policies.  These policies, such as the reimposition of the jizya tax on non-Muslims and the destruction of temples, alienated a significant portion of the Hindu population, fueling resentment and contributing to various rebellions across the empire.  This religious intolerance proved to be a major factor in undermining the loyalty and support of Hindu rulers and the broader population, weakening the empire's foundations.


Statement 2 is also correct. The jagirdari system, a cornerstone of the Mughal administrative and military structure, faced a severe crisis during Aurangzeb's reign.  The discrepancy between the officially assigned income of jagirs (land grants) and the actual revenue collected created widespread discontent among the nobility. This financial instability, coupled with Aurangzeb's increasingly centralized and demanding policies, weakened the loyalty and effectiveness of the Mughal nobility, further destabilizing the empire.  The inability of the jagirdars to maintain their stipulated forces due to financial constraints also diminished the empire's military strength. Therefore, both statements accurately capture significant factors contributing to the weakening of the Mughal empire under Aurangzeb, making (c) the correct answer.


**8. With reference to the cultural contributions of the Deccan sultanates, consider the following statements:**

1. The Deccan sultanates witnessed a flourishing of Urdu literature, with poets drawing upon Persian, Hindi, and Telugu influences to create a unique literary style.
2.  The architectural achievements of the Deccan sultanates are exemplified by structures like the Charminar in Hyderabad and the Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur, showcasing a blend of architectural styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Deccan sultanates fostered a rich literary environment, with Urdu emerging as a significant literary language.  Poets of the Deccan drew inspiration and vocabulary from various sources, including Persian, Hindi, and Telugu, resulting in a distinctive style that blended different linguistic and cultural traditions.  This fusion reflected the multicultural nature of the region and its openness to diverse influences. The development of Dakhini Urdu was a crucial part of this cultural synthesis.


Statement 2 is also correct. The Deccan sultanates left a remarkable architectural legacy, evidenced by iconic structures such as the Charminar in Hyderabad and the Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur. These architectural marvels showcase a skillful blend of architectural styles, reflecting the region's diverse cultural influences.  The Charminar, with its elegant minarets and intricate carvings, exemplifies the grandeur of the Qutb Shahi dynasty.  The Gol Gumbaz, with its massive dome and harmonious proportions, represents the architectural prowess of the Adil Shahi dynasty. Both structures demonstrate the sophistication and artistic skill of the Deccan's builders. Thus, both statements accurately highlight important cultural achievements of the Deccan sultanates, making (c) the correct option.


**9. With reference to the reign of Shah Jahan, consider the following statements:**

1. Shah Jahan's policies in the Deccan, involving a combination of military pressure and diplomatic negotiations, led to treaties with Bijapur and Golconda that established Mughal suzerainty over the region.
2.  The treaties of 1636 with Bijapur and Golconda resulted in a period of peace and prosperity in the Deccan, allowing these sultanates to expand their territories and consolidate their power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Shah Jahan adopted a shrewd strategy in the Deccan, skillfully combining military pressure with diplomatic initiatives.  He employed a combination of force and negotiation to secure treaties with the powerful sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda. These treaties acknowledged Mughal suzerainty, bringing the Deccan more firmly under the Mughal umbrella.  This approach demonstrated Shah Jahan’s political acumen and his ability to achieve his objectives without resorting to prolonged and costly warfare.


Statement 2 is also correct. The treaties of 1636 resulted in a significant period of peace and prosperity in the Deccan.  With Mughal suzerainty established and external threats reduced, both Bijapur and Golconda experienced a period of expansion and consolidation.  They were able to extend their control over territories in the south, leading to an increase in their wealth and influence.  This period of relative stability allowed for economic growth and cultural flourishing in the region, making it a period of notable achievements for the Deccan sultanates.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the significant impact of Shah Jahan's policies in the Deccan during this period, making (c) the correct answer.


**1. With reference to the Bhakti movement in South India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Alvars, a group of poet-saints, primarily worshipped Shiva and composed hymns in Tamil.
2. The Nayanmars, another group of poet-saints, primarily focused on Vishnu and composed hymns in Sanskrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Alvars were a group of twelve poet-saints in South India who were significant figures in the Bhakti movement.  Their devotional hymns, known as *divya prabandham*, were composed in Tamil and primarily centered on the worship of Vishnu.  Their emphasis was on bhakti, or devotion, as a path to salvation, accessible to all regardless of caste.  They rejected rigid asceticism and emphasized a personal, loving relationship with the divine.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Nayanmars were another group of sixty-three poet-saints associated with the Bhakti movement in South India. Unlike the Alvars who focused on Vishnu, the Nayanmars primarily worshipped Shiva.  Their hymns, known as *Tevaram*, were also composed in Tamil, not Sanskrit. They, too, championed bhakti and emphasized the accessibility of devotion to all. The use of Sanskrit is a significant historical inaccuracy in the statement.  The emphasis on regional languages like Tamil was a key feature of the Bhakti movement's accessibility and popularity.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Jainism's patronage and architectural achievements:**

1. The Chalukya rulers of Gujarat were patrons of Jainism, leading to the construction of the Dilwara Temple at Mount Abu.
2. The Paramara rulers of Malwa primarily patronized Buddhism, resulting in the construction of numerous Buddhist monasteries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chalukya dynasty, particularly during its rule in Gujarat, was a significant patron of Jainism.  This patronage led to the construction of several magnificent Jain temples, most notably the Dilwara Temples at Mount Abu. These temples are renowned for their intricate marble carvings and architectural brilliance, showcasing the high level of artistic skill and the significant resources dedicated to Jain religious architecture during this period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Paramara rulers of Malwa did engage in extensive temple building, their patronage primarily focused on Jainism, not Buddhism. They constructed numerous Jain temples and commissioned large images of Jain saints and Mahavira, who began to be worshipped as a god.  The statement's attribution of their patronage to Buddhism is a factual error. The Paramara's support for Jainism reflects the widespread presence and influence of the Jain faith in this region during the medieval period.



**3. With reference to the religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nath Panthi movement challenged the rigid caste system and the Brahmanical dominance.
2.  The Satnamis, a religious group primarily composed of high-caste Hindus, strictly adhered to caste distinctions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nath Panthi movement was a significant religious and social reform movement in medieval India that challenged the rigidities of the caste system and the established authority of the Brahmins.  It advocated a more egalitarian approach, emphasizing spiritual practices accessible to all irrespective of caste.  This stands in contrast to the traditional Brahmanical hierarchy that determined social status and access to religious practices.  The movement's emphasis on yogic practices and its rejection of strict caste norms made it appealing to a wide range of people.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Satnamis were a religious sect that actively rejected caste distinctions. They comprised people from various castes and social backgrounds, including peasants, artisans, and those considered "low caste." Their rejection of caste hierarchies and their emphasis on a shared religious identity marked a departure from the traditional social order. The statement misrepresents their social composition and their stance on caste.  Their inclusive nature contrasted sharply with the prevailing social norms.


**4. With reference to the political landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gurjara-Pratihara empire's disintegration contributed to political instability in North India and facilitated the rise of Turkish power.
2. The Hindushahi rulers of Peshawar and Punjab effectively resisted the Ghaznavid incursions and maintained their independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The decline and eventual disintegration of the Gurjara-Pratihara empire created a power vacuum in North India.  This period of political fragmentation and instability allowed for the rise of several regional powers, creating a fertile ground for the expansion of Turkish influence from the Northwest. The weakened state of the existing North Indian powers made them vulnerable to the aggressive expansionist policies of the Ghaznavids and other Turkish groups.  The lack of a unified and strong resistance from North Indian kingdoms facilitated the Turkish advances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hindushahi rulers, though initially posing a formidable challenge, ultimately failed to effectively resist the Ghaznavid incursions.  While they offered resistance, they were eventually defeated and their kingdom was absorbed into the expanding Ghaznavid empire. The statement overstates their success in resisting the Ghaznavids; their ultimate defeat and the loss of their territories highlight the increasing Turkish dominance in the region.


**5. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deva Raya II's reign witnessed the empire's peak in terms of territorial extent and wealth, as evidenced by contemporary accounts from travellers like Nicolo Conti and Abdur Razzaq.
2.  The Bahmani kingdom, throughout its existence, maintained a consistent policy of religious tolerance and co-existence with the Vijayanagara empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The reign of Deva Raya II is widely considered a high point in the Vijayanagara Empire's history. Contemporary accounts from foreign travellers like Nicolo Conti and Abdur Razzaq provide compelling evidence of the empire's vast extent, immense wealth, and powerful military.  Their descriptions of the capital city, its size, and the king's resources, paint a picture of a prosperous and dominant empire in South India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The relationship between the Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani kingdom was characterized by frequent conflict and warfare, not consistent religious tolerance and coexistence. Although periods of relative peace and even diplomatic exchanges occurred, the fundamental rivalry between these two major powers of South India led to repeated military clashes over territory, resources, and political dominance. The statement incorrectly presents their relationship as one of consistent harmony. The conflicts between them were a defining feature of the political landscape of South India during this period.


**1. With reference to the Bhakti movement in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Alvars, primarily associated with Vaishnavism, composed devotional hymns in Tamil, significantly impacting the lower castes who were previously excluded from Vedic scholarship.
2.  The Nayanmars, primarily associated with Shaivism, focused on rigorous asceticism and ritualistic practices, thereby maintaining the existing social hierarchy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Alvars were a group of poet-saints who significantly contributed to the Bhakti movement in South India.  Their devotional hymns, composed in Tamil, a language accessible to the masses, bypassed the traditional Sanskrit-centric Vedic system. This made their message of love and devotion to God accessible to the lower castes who were previously excluded from Vedic scholarship and worship. The Bhakti movement's emphasis on devotion over rigid caste distinctions was a key factor in its widespread appeal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Nayanmars, the Shaiva counterparts to the Alvars,  were also significant figures in the Bhakti movement. However, unlike the assertion in statement 2, they did *not* primarily focus on rigorous asceticism and ritualistic practices.  Their approach, like the Alvars', emphasized devotion and love for God, and they actively challenged the rigid social hierarchy through their inclusive message, making it accessible to all irrespective of caste.  The statement misrepresents their inclusive and devotional approach.


**2. With reference to the spread of Sufism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chishti order, introduced by Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, emphasized a life of poverty and seclusion, actively rejecting involvement in political affairs.
2. The Suharwardi order, unlike the Chishtis, actively participated in state affairs and held important positions within the Mughal court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chishti order, founded by Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti, did emphasize a life of simplicity and piety, it's inaccurate to say they completely rejected political involvement.  While they generally avoided direct participation in court politics, their influence permeated society, and their teachings impacted the lives of many, including rulers and nobles.  The statement oversimplifies the complex relationship between the Chishtis and the political landscape.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Suharwardi order differed from the Chishtis in its approach to worldly matters.  Many Suharwardi saints accepted service in the state, holding influential positions in the Mughal court and other administrative structures. This demonstrates a pragmatic approach to spreading their religious message, using their positions to influence society from within the power structures.


**3. With reference to the Jain temples of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dilwara Temple at Mount Abu is a prime example of the architectural achievements of the Chalukya dynasty's patronage of Jainism during the medieval period.
2.  The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola, sculpted during the ninth and tenth centuries, depicts Mahavira in a seated posture, signifying his meditative practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dilwara Temples at Mount Abu are indeed magnificent examples of Jain architecture.  However, they were built under the patronage of the Chaulukya dynasty (not Chalukya, a different dynasty) of Gujarat, highlighting the significant role of this dynasty in supporting Jain religious and artistic expression during the medieval era. The statement correctly identifies the temple and its significance but slightly misattributes the patron dynasty.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The colossal statue at Sravana Belgola is a remarkable achievement, but the description is inaccurate.  The statue depicts Gomateshwara (Bahubali), a significant figure in Jainism, not Mahavira, and he is depicted in a standing posture, reflecting his rigorous austerities and not a seated meditative pose as stated.  The statement misidentifies the subject of the statue and its artistic representation.


**4.  With reference to the religious and intellectual movements of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy directly challenged the core tenets of Buddhism and Jainism, significantly contributing to the revival of Hinduism.
2. Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita philosophy, while accepting the importance of bhakti, emphasized the need for knowledge (jnana) as a prerequisite for achieving salvation, thus limiting its appeal to the masses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sankara's Advaita Vedanta, with its emphasis on the non-dual nature of reality (Brahman), provided a powerful philosophical framework that countered the core tenets of Buddhism and Jainism. This contributed significantly to the revival and consolidation of Hinduism as a dominant religious and intellectual force in India.  The statement accurately reflects Sankara's impact on the religious landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita philosophy, while acknowledging the role of knowledge (jnana), strongly emphasized the importance of bhakti (devotion) as the primary path to salvation.  Unlike the claim in statement 2,  he argued that God's grace was paramount and that the path of prapatti (total surrender to God) was open to all, regardless of caste or social standing.  This inclusive approach made his philosophy widely accessible and contributed to the Bhakti movement's success. The statement misrepresents the emphasis of Ramanuja's philosophy.


**5. With reference to the social and religious reforms of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's "Ibadat Khana" debates, aimed at fostering religious harmony, ultimately resulted in a greater understanding and rapprochement between different religious communities.
2.  Akbar's Din-i Ilahi, while not a formal religion with scriptures or rituals, aimed to create a personal bond of loyalty among his nobles, transcending religious differences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Ibadat Khana" debates, while intended to promote interfaith dialogue, ultimately failed to achieve their goal. Instead of fostering understanding, they often led to acrimonious disputes and heightened religious tensions.  The statement misrepresents the outcome of Akbar's efforts at religious harmony.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's Din-i Ilahi was a unique initiative. It was not a conventional religion with defined scriptures or rituals but rather a syncretic system that aimed to create a personal bond of loyalty and devotion between Akbar and his nobles, irrespective of their religious backgrounds. This served both religious and political purposes, demonstrating Akbar's pragmatic approach to governance and his attempts to transcend religious divisions.  The statement accurately portrays the nature and purpose of Din-i Ilahi.


**6. With reference to the early phases of the Turkish conquest of North India, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Battle of Tarain (1191) resulted in a decisive victory for the Ghurid forces under Muhammad Ghori, paving the way for the subsequent conquest of Delhi.
2. The Second Battle of Tarain (1192) saw Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat, marking a significant turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The First Battle of Tarain (1191) resulted in a *decisive victory for Prithviraj Chauhan*, not Muhammad Ghori.  Ghori was forced to retreat after suffering a significant loss. This initial setback is often overlooked, leading to a misconception about the immediate consequences of the battle.

Statement 2 is correct. The Second Battle of Tarain (1192) witnessed the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan and marked a crucial turning point in Indian history. This victory allowed Muhammad Ghori to consolidate his power in the region, laying the foundation for the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate. The statement correctly identifies the significance of the battle.


**7. With reference to the socio-religious movements challenging the established order in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Kabir, a weaver by profession, vehemently opposed the caste system and emphasized the unity of God, irrespective of religious affiliation.
2.  Guru Nanak, while advocating for a monotheistic faith, strictly adhered to the traditional Hindu caste system, limiting the appeal of his teachings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kabir, a prominent figure in the Bhakti movement, strongly criticized the caste system and emphasized the fundamental unity of God, rejecting the religious distinctions between Hinduism and Islam. His teachings resonated with the marginalized sections of society, advocating for social equality and spiritual unity.  The statement accurately reflects Kabir's key beliefs and social impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism,  also strongly opposed the caste system and advocated for a monotheistic faith that transcended religious boundaries.  His teachings were inclusive and aimed at fostering religious harmony, thereby challenging the rigid social structures of the time. The statement misrepresents Guru Nanak’s inclusive and egalitarian philosophy.


**8. With reference to the literary and artistic achievements of the Medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The use of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi in literary works during this period was primarily confined to religious texts, with secular literature remaining predominantly in Sanskrit and Persian.
2. Amir Khusrau, a prominent poet, significantly contributed to the development of a new style of Persian poetry known as "sabak-i-hindi," incorporating elements of Indian languages and cultural sensibilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sanskrit and Persian remained significant languages in Medieval India, the use of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi expanded beyond religious texts to encompass secular literature as well.  A rich body of secular poetry, prose, and other literary forms emerged in these languages, reflecting the growing confidence and maturity of these regional literary traditions. The statement underestimates the diversity and scope of medieval Indian literature.

Statement 2 is correct. Amir Khusrau is renowned for his significant contributions to Persian literature. He pioneered a new style known as "sabak-i-hindi," which uniquely blended Persian poetic forms with elements of Indian languages and cultural themes. This fusion reflected the growing interaction and cultural exchange between Persian and Indian literary traditions during the medieval period. The statement accurately highlights Khusrau's artistic innovation.


**9. With reference to the Jat and Sikh movements during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat uprisings were primarily agrarian in nature, rooted in peasant discontent over land revenue policies and zamindari systems.
2.  The early Sikh movement, under Guru Gobind Singh, actively engaged in armed conflict with the Mughal empire, resulting in widespread violence and persecution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jat uprisings during the Mughal period were largely agrarian in nature, stemming from deep-seated peasant discontent over land revenue policies, the oppressive zamindari system, and social injustices. While religious factors played a role in mobilizing the Jat community, the core issues were economic and social in nature, highlighting the challenges faced by the rural peasantry under Mughal rule. The statement correctly identifies the primary causes of the Jat uprisings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The early Sikh movement, under Guru Gobind Singh, did face persecution from the Mughal authorities, but it's inaccurate to portray their resistance as solely consisting of widespread armed conflict during the early stages.  While armed resistance did emerge later, the early phase focused more on religious and cultural assertion, with open armed conflict escalating more significantly in later periods. The statement misrepresents the timeline and nature of Sikh resistance in its early years.


**1. With reference to the orthodox reactions to religious reform movements in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Raghunandan of Navadwipa vehemently defended Brahmanical privileges, asserting their exclusive right to scriptural study and preaching, and ultimately claiming only two varnas existed in the Kali Yuga: Brahmins and Shudras.
2. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the Muslim orthodox revivalist movement, opposed the Sufi concept of *tauhid* (divine unity), advocating for the re-imposition of the *jizyah* tax and stricter separation between Hindus and Muslims.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the orthodox responses to the growing liberal trends in medieval India.  Statement 1 correctly describes Raghunandan's staunch defense of Brahmanical supremacy and his assertion of a two-varna system in the Kali Yuga. This reflects the anxieties of the orthodox Hindu establishment facing challenges to their traditional authority and social hierarchy from Bhakti movements and other reformist ideologies that emphasized social equality.  His writings represent a strong reaction against the erosion of Brahmanical power and a reassertion of traditional norms.

Statement 2 accurately portrays Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's role in the Muslim orthodox revival.  He actively opposed the pantheistic mysticism (*tauhid*) embraced by some Sufi orders, viewing it as a deviation from orthodox Islam. His advocacy for the re-imposition of the *jizyah* tax and a more stringent approach towards Hindus demonstrates a clear attempt to consolidate Islamic identity and curb perceived Hindu influence.  Sirhindi's actions and writings represent a conservative response to the relatively liberal policies of Akbar and the syncretic tendencies within certain Sufi circles.  The two statements together illustrate the parallel conservative reactions within both major religious communities during a period of significant social and religious change.


**2. With reference to the Mughal succession crisis of 1657-1658, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal tradition of succession was clearly defined, based on primogeniture, and Shah Jahan's nomination of Dara Shikoh was universally accepted by his other sons.
2. Aurangzeb's victory at the Battle of Dharmat significantly bolstered his prestige and weakened Dara Shikoh's position, contributing to his ultimate triumph.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mughal system of succession was far from clear-cut.  While the ruler had the right to nominate an heir, this was not always binding. The Timurid tradition of partitioning was unsuccessful in India and the lack of a strong established precedent led to frequent disputes among brothers.  Shah Jahan's attempt to secure Dara Shikoh's succession through nomination only exacerbated tensions among his other sons, who saw it as an act of partiality.  The absence of a well-defined system, coupled with the ambitions of the princes, fueled the war of succession.

Statement 2 is correct. The Battle of Dharmat was a pivotal moment in the war of succession. Aurangzeb's victory against the combined forces of Murad and Raja Jaswant Singh significantly enhanced his military reputation and bolstered the morale of his supporters.  This victory, contrasted with Dara Shikoh's strategic miscalculations (such as deploying his best troops in the east), significantly tilted the balance of power in Aurangzeb's favor.  The defeat at Dharmat demoralized Dara's supporters and contributed to the unraveling of his claim to the throne.  The subsequent events, including Aurangzeb's strategic alliances and Dara's tactical errors, ultimately led to Aurangzeb's victory.


**3. With reference to the religious policies of Aurangzeb, consider the following statements:**

1. Aurangzeb's policy regarding temples strictly adhered to the *sharia*, allowing the repair of existing temples but prohibiting the construction of new ones, while the destruction of temples was only carried out as punishment for political rebellions.
2. The re-imposition of the *jizyah* tax under Aurangzeb was primarily motivated by economic necessity, aimed at bolstering the imperial treasury to fund his extensive military campaigns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aurangzeb initially attempted to adhere to the *sharia*’s principle of not demolishing existing temples, his actions went beyond this.  The destruction of temples was not solely confined to punishment for rebellions; it became a tool to express religious zeal and assert dominance. The interpretation of "long-standing temples" was often arbitrary, and the destruction of significant temples like those at Varanasi and Mathura demonstrates a departure from a purely legalistic approach.  His policy created a climate of fear and uncertainty among the Hindu population.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The re-imposition of the *jizyah* tax was not primarily driven by economic needs. Although the revenue generated was significant, Aurangzeb’s motivations were more complex and multifaceted. The re-imposition served political and ideological purposes:  it aimed to rally Muslim support, assert the superiority of Islam, and reward the ulama. The economic benefits were secondary to the broader political and religious aims of consolidating Muslim identity and power. The *jizyah*’s reintroduction, therefore, was a politically charged decision with significant social and religious consequences, rather than a purely fiscal measure.


**4. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its interaction with Sufism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement's emphasis on personal devotion to a single God, disregarding caste distinctions, was entirely independent of any Sufi influence, emerging solely from within the existing Hindu religious framework.
2.  The use of vernacular languages in Bhakti poetry and the adoption of musical gatherings (*kirtan*) as a form of devotional practice demonstrate a clear convergence of Bhakti and Sufi traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement had deep roots in Hindu traditions, it's inaccurate to claim complete independence from Sufi influence.  The emphasis on personal devotion to a single God, the rejection of ritualistic formalism, and the emphasis on emotional experience resonate with Sufi ideals.  The interaction between Bhakti saints and Sufi mystics, as evidenced by accounts of Namadeva's interactions with Sufi saints in Delhi, suggests a degree of cross-cultural exchange and mutual influence.  The shared emphasis on direct experience of the divine and the rejection of rigid religious hierarchies fostered a climate of intellectual exchange between the two traditions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The use of vernacular languages in Bhakti poetry made the movement accessible to a wider population, transcending the limitations of Sanskrit. This parallels the Sufi practice of using local dialects to communicate their message effectively.  Furthermore, the adoption of musical gatherings (*kirtan*) in the Vaishnava tradition mirrors the Sufi use of *sama* as a means of achieving spiritual ecstasy and union with the divine.  These shared practices demonstrate a convergence of Bhakti and Sufi traditions, highlighting the shared emphasis on emotional and experiential aspects of faith over strict adherence to ritualistic norms.  The similarities in approach broadened the appeal of both movements across religious boundaries.


**5. With reference to the Jat and Sikh movements in the late Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat uprisings were primarily peasant revolts against unjust land revenue policies, with little religious motivation, and their eventual establishment of a separate principality was a direct outcome of the Mughal decline.
2. Guru Tegh Bahadur's execution was primarily a consequence of his open defiance of Aurangzeb's religious policies and his active support for the Hindu faith in Kashmir, leading to the militarization of the Sikh movement under Guru Gobind Singh.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification. While the Jat uprisings had agrarian roots stemming from conflicts over land revenue and zamindari rights,  it is inaccurate to dismiss entirely the religious or political dimensions.  The Jats’ strong sense of community and their resistance were intertwined with broader socio-political factors. The eventual establishment of a Jat principality was not solely a consequence of Mughal decline but also a result of the Jats' own organization and their ability to capitalize on the weakening of Mughal authority.  The movement's evolution demonstrates the complex interplay of agrarian grievances, social identity, and political ambition.

Statement 2 is also an oversimplification.  While Guru Tegh Bahadur's execution undoubtedly stemmed from a conflict with Aurangzeb, the precise reasons remain debated. The accounts suggesting his support for Kashmiri Brahmins facing persecution and his opposition to forcible conversions are not definitively proven.  The Mughal government’s concern might have also included the guru's growing influence and potential for unrest.  The subsequent militarization of the Sikh movement under Guru Gobind Singh was a complex process influenced by various factors, including the execution of the Guru,  the growing persecution of Sikhs, and the need for self-defense in a turbulent political climate.  Attributing the militarization solely to Aurangzeb's religious policies is an incomplete analysis.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the socio-religious transformations in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Shiva and Vishnu, rejecting austerities and emphasizing a loving bond between the devotee and the deity.  
2. The Lingayat movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, vehemently opposed the caste system, child marriage, and advocated widow remarriage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bhakti movement, particularly in South India with the Nayanmars and Alvars, was characterized by its devotion to Shiva and Vishnu, a rejection of rigid asceticism, and a focus on a personal, loving relationship with the divine.  They emphasized accessibility to all castes, using vernacular languages like Tamil to spread their message.  This contrasts with earlier, more ritualistic forms of Hinduism.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Lingayat (or Virashaiva) movement, originating in Karnataka, strongly challenged the rigid caste system prevalent in Hindu society.  Its founders, Basava and Channabasava, actively promoted social equality, opposing practices like child marriage and advocating for widow remarriage.  Their emphasis on a direct relationship with Shiva, bypassing Brahmanical intermediaries, further underscored their reformist stance.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of significant socio-religious movements in medieval India.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the decline of Jainism in medieval India:**

1. The growing rigidity of Jain doctrines and the loss of royal patronage contributed significantly to the decline of Jainism in several regions.
2. The rise of the Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on a personal relationship with God, did not significantly impact the popularity of Jainism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the increasing rigidity of Jain practices and the dwindling royal patronage contributed to Jainism's decline.  While Jainism continued to thrive in certain areas and communities (like trading communities and Gujarat under Chalukyan patronage), its overall influence waned in many regions due to these factors.  The loss of royal support meant fewer resources for temple construction and the dissemination of Jain teachings.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Bhakti movement, with its inclusive message and emphasis on personal devotion, directly competed with Jainism for followers. The Bhakti movement successfully attracted many adherents from various sects, including Buddhists and Jains, thereby contributing to the relative decline of Jainism in some regions.  The Bhakti movement's popularity thus represents a significant factor in the changing religious landscape, impacting Jainism's position.


**3. With reference to the religious and intellectual currents of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Shankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy posed a significant intellectual challenge to Buddhism and Jainism by emphasizing the oneness of God and the world.
2. Ramanuja's philosophy, while rooted in the Vedas, emphasized the importance of divine grace (bhakti) for salvation, making it more accessible to all castes, including Shudras and Dalits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, a non-dualistic philosophy, presented a powerful intellectual counterpoint to the doctrines of Buddhism and Jainism.  By asserting the ultimate unity of Brahman (the absolute reality) and Atman (the individual self), it offered a different path to liberation that challenged the core tenets of these other schools of thought.  His emphasis on Vedic authority further solidified its position within the Hindu tradition.

Statement 2 is also correct. Ramanuja, while upholding the Vedic tradition, significantly modified it by emphasizing the path of bhakti (devotion) as the primary means of achieving salvation.  This contrasted with the more knowledge-based (jnana) approach emphasized by Shankara.  Ramanuja’s inclusive approach, emphasizing the importance of divine grace over rigorous knowledge, made his philosophy accessible to a wider range of people, including those from lower castes, thus broadening the appeal of Hinduism.


**4.  With reference to the socio-political dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kayastha caste emerged as a distinct group primarily composed of individuals from various castes who served in royal establishments.
2. The Jats, initially a pastoral nomadic tribe, transitioned into agricultural communities and warriors, achieving a relatively elevated social status compared to other Shudras.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the emergence of the Kayastha caste. The text indicates that the Kayasthas originated from diverse caste backgrounds, primarily those working in royal administrations. Over time, this occupational group solidified into a distinct caste, highlighting the fluidity and evolution of the caste system in medieval India.  This demonstrates the dynamic nature of social stratification and the role of occupation in shaping caste identities.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text notes the Jats' transformation from a pastoral nomadic group into agricultural communities and warriors. While classified as Shudras within the varna system, their elevated social standing compared to other Shudras showcases the complexities of the caste system and the potential for social mobility based on occupation and power.  Their transition exemplifies the adaptation and integration of various groups within the existing social structure.


**5. With reference to the cultural interactions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sufi movement in India embraced elements of Bhakti poetry and incorporated Hindi into its devotional expressions, signifying cultural exchange between Hindu and Muslim traditions.
2.  The translation of Sanskrit texts into Persian, notably under the patronage of Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin of Kashmir, facilitated the exchange of knowledge between Hindu and Muslim scholars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly highlights the cultural synthesis between Sufism and Bhakti traditions.  The text points to the adoption of Bhakti poetry and the use of Hindi in Sufi devotional literature, showcasing a significant level of cultural exchange and mutual influence.  Sufi saints engaged in dialogues and interactions with Hindu saints, leading to a shared vocabulary of religious expression. This demonstrates the permeability of religious boundaries and the blending of cultural practices.

Statement 2 is also accurate.  The text mentions the translation of Sanskrit works into Persian, particularly under the patronage of Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin of Kashmir. This initiative directly contributed to the exchange of knowledge and ideas between Hindu and Muslim intellectuals.  Such translations facilitated access to Hindu philosophical and literary traditions for Muslim scholars and vice-versa, fostering intellectual cross-fertilization and mutual understanding.  This demonstrates a conscious effort to bridge cultural divides through the dissemination of knowledge.


**6.  Consider the following statements regarding the early Turkish conquests in North India:**

1. The Ghurid conquest of North India began with the defeat of the Hindushahi rulers in the Punjab, followed by victories against the Chauhans and Gahadavalas.
2. The battle of Tarain (1192) is considered a pivotal moment in Indian history, marking the beginning of the widespread establishment of Turkish rule in North India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text describes the Ghurid conquests as starting with the subjugation of the Hindushahi kingdom in the Punjab, paving the way for further expansion into the Gangetic plains.  Their subsequent victories over the Chauhans (at Tarain) and the Gahadavalas (at Chandawar) solidified their control over a significant part of North India.  This illustrates a clear pattern of conquest, moving from the northwest towards the east.

Statement 2 is also correct. The second battle of Tarain (1192) is explicitly identified as a turning point in Indian history, marking the commencement of substantial Turkish rule in the region.  This victory decisively shifted the balance of power, laying the foundation for the Delhi Sultanate and the subsequent expansion of Muslim rule in India.  The battle's significance lies not only in its military outcome but also in its long-term political and cultural consequences.


**7. With reference to the Mughal Empire's internal conflicts and regional uprisings, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jat uprisings in the Agra-Delhi region were primarily agrarian in nature, stemming from conflicts over land revenue and zamindari rights.
2. The Sikh movement's initial clashes with the Mughal rulers were primarily religious in nature, stemming from Aurangzeb's religious policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Jat uprisings are described as having primarily agrarian roots, arising from disputes related to land revenue collection and zamindari rights. While religious factors might have played a role in mobilizing support, the core conflicts were economic and political, concerning the control and distribution of land resources.  This highlights the complex interplay of economic, social, and political factors in shaping these rebellions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Sikh movement eventually clashed with Mughal authorities, the text suggests that the early conflicts were not primarily religious in nature.  The conflicts are attributed to factors such as hunting incidents and disputes over land and resources, rather than directly stemming from Aurangzeb's religious policies.  Religious factors became more prominent later in the Sikh movement's development, but the initial clashes were rooted in other issues.  This demonstrates that even religious movements often have complex and multifaceted origins.


**8. Consider the following statements about the literary and cultural landscape of medieval India:**

1.  Amir Khusrau, a prominent figure in Persian literature, demonstrated a deep affection for India and incorporated Hindi elements into his works, reflecting cultural fusion.
2.  The development of regional languages, such as Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi, during this period was largely independent of the influence of Persian and Sanskrit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately portrays Amir Khusrau's contributions. The text describes his love for India and his integration of Hindi elements into his Persian writings, signifying the cultural blending of the time.  His creation of the "sabag-i-hindi" (style of India) further underscores this cultural fusion, indicating a significant interaction between Persian and local linguistic traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The evolution of regional languages during this period was significantly influenced by both Persian and Sanskrit.  The text indicates that these languages drew upon and interacted with both traditions, demonstrating the complex interplay of linguistic influences that shaped the development of modern Indian languages.  The mutual influence of Persian and Sanskrit on regional languages underscores the dynamic nature of linguistic evolution in a multicultural context.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer, a detailed explanation, and analysis of why other options are incorrect.

**1. With reference to the orthodox responses to the liberal religious and social movements in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Raghunandan of Navadwipa vehemently opposed the growing influence of Sufi saints and their liberal interpretations of religious texts.
2. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the Muslim orthodox movement, advocated for the re-imposition of the jizya tax and stricter policies towards Hindus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a staunch defender of orthodox Islamic principles, actively opposed Akbar's syncretic policies.  He championed a return to traditional Islamic practices and advocated for the re-imposition of the jizya tax, a tax levied on non-Muslims, reflecting a stricter approach towards the Hindu population. His actions and writings clearly demonstrate his role in the orthodox revivalist movement.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Raghunandan of Navadwipa was indeed an influential orthodox Hindu writer who emphasized Brahmanical privileges, the provided text doesn't directly link his opposition to Sufi saints. His focus was primarily on reinforcing the hierarchical structure within Hinduism, not directly engaging with the Sufi movement's liberal interpretations.  The text highlights his assertions of Brahmanical dominance and the perceived decline of other varnas, not a direct confrontation with Sufism.  Therefore, linking his views solely to a response against Sufi influence is an inaccurate extrapolation.


**2. With reference to the Mughal succession crisis following Shah Jahan's illness, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Timurid tradition of partitioning the empire was successfully implemented, preventing a major war of succession.
2.  Shah Jahan's nomination of Dara Shikoh as his successor exacerbated tensions among his sons, leading to the war.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Shah Jahan's attempt to ensure a smooth succession by nominating Dara Shikoh as his heir (wali-ahd) backfired.  This act of perceived partiality inflamed the ambitions of his other sons, Aurangzeb, Murad, and Shuja, directly contributing to the outbreak of the war of succession.  The text explicitly states that Shah Jahan's actions, intended to prevent conflict, instead solidified his sons' determination to fight for the throne.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Timurid tradition of partitioning the empire had not been successful and was never applied in India. The Mughal succession crisis demonstrates the failure of any established tradition to prevent a violent struggle for power.  The absence of a clear and universally accepted tradition of succession within both Muslim and Hindu contexts fueled the conflict.  The princes' actions directly contradict the idea of a successful implementation of any partitioning tradition.


**3.  With reference to the Bhakti movement in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, exclusively preached his doctrine of Bhakti to the upper three varnas, maintaining the existing social hierarchy.
2.  Kabir's teachings emphasized the unity of Allah, Sain, and Sahib, while rejecting idol worship and formal religious rituals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  Kabir's philosophy is accurately described. He championed the oneness of God, irrespective of religious labels, and strongly criticized idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious practices. His teachings focused on a simple, direct path to spiritual enlightenment, accessible to all irrespective of caste or creed.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that Ramananda, unlike the statement claims,  taught his doctrine of Bhakti to all four varnas, actively challenging the rigid caste system. He disregarded traditional caste restrictions on inter-dining and included disciples from all social strata, including the lower castes. This directly contradicts the statement’s assertion of his exclusivity towards upper varnas.  Ramananda's inclusive approach was a key feature of the Bhakti movement's social reform aspect.


**4. With reference to the Sufi movement in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chishti order, unlike the Suharwardi order, strictly adhered to a life of poverty and actively avoided involvement with the ruling class.
2.  The concept of *Tauhid-i-Wahdat* (Unity of Being), popularized by Ibn Arabi, was widely accepted by orthodox elements within Islam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text highlights a key difference between the Chishti and Suharwardi Sufi orders. The Chishti order, exemplified by figures like Nizamuddin Auliya, emphasized a life of simplicity and detachment from worldly power, actively choosing to remain aloof from the political sphere.  In contrast, the Suharwardi order was more open to accepting positions of influence within the state. This distinction in their approach to worldly involvement is a crucial aspect of understanding their respective roles within the Sufi movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The concept of *Tauhid-i-Wahdat*, while gaining popularity among some Sufis, was vehemently opposed by orthodox Islamic elements. The text states that Ibn Arabi's followers faced persecution for his pantheistic views, which challenged the traditional distinction between the creator and the created.  The orthodox rejection of this concept underscores the tension between mystical and orthodox interpretations of Islam.


**5. With reference to the socio-religious landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kayastha caste emerged as a distinct social group during this period, primarily comprising individuals from diverse caste backgrounds who served in royal administrations.
2. The practice of *sati*, while condemned by some, was widely prevalent across various regions, sometimes requiring the sultan's permission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explains the evolution of the Kayastha caste as a distinct social group, originating from a diverse background of individuals who served in royal administrations.  Over time, they solidified their identity as a separate caste.  This highlights the fluidity and complexities of the caste system during the period, demonstrating how new social groups could emerge based on occupation and service.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text mentions the varying opinions on *sati* among religious scholars, with some condemning it while others allowing it under specific conditions.  Ibn Battuta's account further confirms its prevalence in certain regions, even requiring the sultan's permission in some instances. This reflects the complex social and religious realities of the time, where traditional practices like *sati* existed alongside varying degrees of acceptance and regulation.


**6. With reference to the early Ghaznavid raids into India, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahmud of Ghazni's initial raids primarily targeted the Rajput kingdoms in the Indo-Gangetic plain, aiming to plunder their wealthy temples.
2. The Hindushahi rulers, facing Mahmud's aggression, received significant military support from the Rajput kingdoms of north India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Mahmud of Ghazni's initial raids focused on the Hindushahi kingdom in the Punjab region, not the Rajput kingdoms of the Gangetic plain. While he later raided the Gangetic plain, his initial targets were the Shahis.  This shows a strategic progression of his conquests, starting with the weaker, bordering kingdoms before moving deeper into India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text specifically points out that the Hindushahi rulers fought largely alone against Mahmud's forces. They did not receive substantial military assistance from Rajput kingdoms. This highlights the political fragmentation of north India at the time and the lack of a unified response to the Ghaznavid threat.  The absence of Rajput support underscores the limited inter-kingdom cooperation during this era.


**7. With reference to the literary and cultural developments during the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Amir Khusrau, while writing primarily in Persian, showcased a deep affection for India and its diverse languages, including Hindi.
2. Sanskrit literature during this period largely ignored the presence of Muslims in India, with minimal attempts at translating Islamic works or Persian literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Amir Khusrau, a prominent figure in Persian literature, expressed his love for India and its cultural richness, including its various languages.  He is celebrated for his contributions to a distinctive style of Persian known as *sabak-i-hindi*, reflecting his engagement with Indian linguistic and cultural elements. This exemplifies the cultural exchange and integration that occurred during the period.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text notes that Sanskrit literature largely overlooked the Muslim presence in India.  There were few attempts to translate Islamic works into Sanskrit, indicating a limited cultural exchange between the two literary traditions. This points to the relative isolation of Sanskrit scholarship from the broader cultural transformations occurring in India during the medieval period.  The limited interaction reflects the existing social and religious divisions.


**8. With reference to the uprisings and movements challenging Mughal authority in the late 17th century, consider the following statements:**

1. The Satnami rebellion of 1672 was primarily a peasant uprising, characterized by its rejection of caste distinctions and its unified stance against the Mughal state.
2. The Afghan uprisings in the northwest were primarily driven by religious motivations, with little to no influence from economic factors or the desire for regional independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Satnami rebellion accurately reflects a peasant uprising that challenged the Mughal state. The text highlights the Satnamis' rejection of caste divisions and their unified resistance, demonstrating a social and political rebellion.  Their unified stance against the Mughal state showcases a collective action against perceived oppression.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Afghan uprisings were complex, motivated by a combination of economic hardship, political ambitions, and the desire for regional autonomy. While religious factors played a role, especially with the Raushanai movement, to reduce it solely to religious motivations is a simplification.  Economic pressures, including limited livelihood opportunities in the mountainous region and the desire for self-governance, played significant roles in fueling the uprisings.  The ambition of establishing a separate Afghan state is explicitly mentioned in the text.


**9. With reference to the economic and social conditions in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Artisans and workers in towns faced harsh living conditions, with low wages even during Akbar's reign, reflecting significant economic inequality.
2.  The practice of *purdah* (seclusion of women) became widespread among the upper classes during this period, primarily due to fears of abduction by invaders.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text provides evidence of the difficult economic conditions faced by artisans and workers, with low wages even under Akbar's rule. This highlights the vast economic disparities within medieval Indian society.  The low wages, even in a relatively prosperous period, show that economic inequality wasn't solely a result of conflict or instability but also a structural feature of the society.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the practice of *purdah* did indeed become more prevalent among the upper classes, the text suggests that the reasons were more complex than solely the fear of abduction.  Social factors, such as the desire to emulate the elite and religious justifications, also played a significant role.  Attributing it exclusively to the fear of abduction oversimplifies the cultural and social dynamics behind the adoption of *purdah*.  The text suggests the practice was already in vogue in ancient Iran and Greece before coming to India.


**1. With reference to the religious and social milieu of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. Raghunandan of Navadwipa vehemently asserted Brahmanical privileges, claiming exclusive scriptural reading and preaching rights, and positing a two-varna system (Brahmins and Shudras) in the Kali Yuga.
2. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the Muslim orthodox revivalist movement, opposed pantheistic mysticism (tauhid), practices influenced by Hinduism (like music in religious gatherings), and advocated for the re-imposition of jizyah.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Raghunandan's staunch defense of Brahmanical supremacy in his Dharmashastra writings during the medieval period.  His assertion of exclusive rights for Brahmins to read scriptures and preach, coupled with his reduction of the varna system to only Brahmins and Shudras, highlights the conservative and exclusionary tendencies within certain segments of Hindu society during this era. This assertion of Brahmanical authority is a key aspect of understanding the social and religious dynamics of the time.

Statement 2 correctly identifies Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's role as a leading figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement. His opposition to pantheistic mysticism (tauhid), which emphasized the unity of God and creation, reveals a strong adherence to traditional Islamic doctrines.  His condemnation of practices he perceived as Hindu influences, along with his advocacy for the re-imposition of jizyah (a tax on non-Muslims), underscores the growing tension and divergence between certain segments of the Muslim and Hindu populations.  His actions represent a significant counterpoint to the more syncretic policies of rulers like Akbar.  The contrast between these two figures illustrates the complex interplay of religious and political forces in medieval India.


**2. With reference to the Mughal succession crisis and the Battle of Samugarh, consider the following statements:**

1.  Shah Jahan's nomination of Dara Shikoh as his successor (wali-ahd) was intended to ensure a peaceful transition, but it instead fueled ambition among his other sons, leading to a war of succession.
2. The Battle of Samugarh (1658) was primarily a contest of military strategy, with Aurangzeb's superior generalship and battle-hardened troops overcoming Dara Shikoh's numerically larger but less organized army.  Religious differences played a minor role in this conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct because Shah Jahan's attempt to bypass the usual ambiguities of Mughal succession by explicitly naming Dara Shikoh as his heir backfired. This act, while intended to prevent conflict, instead galvanized Dara's brothers, particularly Aurangzeb, to challenge his claim. This highlights the inherent instability within the Mughal succession system and the ever-present potential for conflict among ambitious princes. The lack of a clear hereditary principle exacerbated the situation, leading to a significant power struggle.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Battle of Samugarh is often analyzed as a clash of military leadership rather than a purely religious conflict. While Aurangzeb utilized religious rhetoric to garner support, the battle's outcome was primarily determined by strategic acumen and the quality of the opposing armies. Aurangzeb's disciplined and experienced troops proved superior to Dara Shikoh's hastily assembled forces, despite Dara's numerical advantage.  The diverse composition of both armies – including both Hindu and Muslim nobles fighting on both sides – further underscores the limited significance of religious factors in this specific conflict.  The battle's outcome underscores the crucial role of effective military strategy and leadership in achieving political dominance during this period.


**3. With reference to the religious movements of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhakti movement in South India, led by Nayanmars and Alvars, rejected austerities, emphasizing a loving bond between God and devotee and employing accessible Tamil language to reach wider audiences, including lower castes.
2. The Lingayat or Virashaiva movement, founded by Basava and Channabasava, strongly opposed the caste system, rejecting traditional rituals and advocating for social reforms like opposing child marriage and allowing widow remarriage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the key features of the Bhakti movement in South India. The Nayanmars and Alvars, through their devotional poetry and accessible language (Tamil), significantly broadened the appeal of Hinduism, particularly among the lower castes who were previously excluded from Vedic scholarship and traditional worship.  Their emphasis on love and devotion as the central tenets of religious practice, in contrast to rigid asceticism, resonated deeply with the masses. This emphasis on bhakti as a path open to all, regardless of caste, was a crucial aspect of the movement's success.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the radical social and religious stance of the Lingayat movement.  Founded by Basava and Channabasava, this movement challenged the deeply entrenched caste system and rejected many traditional Hindu rituals.  Their advocacy for social reforms, such as opposing child marriage and permitting widow remarriage, was groundbreaking for its time and demonstrates a commitment to social justice and equality.  The Lingayats' rejection of traditional hierarchical structures and their focus on social reform are significant in understanding the diverse religious and social currents of medieval India.


**4. With reference to the intellectual and religious climate of 15th and 16th century India, consider the following statements:**

1. Kabir and Nanak, while critical of existing social order, strongly advocated for Hindu-Muslim unity, emphasizing monotheism and rejecting ritualistic practices common to both Hinduism and Islam.  Their impact was immediate and profound, leading to widespread societal changes.
2. The Vaishnava movement, with figures like Chaitanya, Narsinh Mehta, Meera, and Surdas, utilized the Radha-Krishna narrative allegorically to express the relationship between the individual soul and the supreme soul, welcoming all irrespective of caste or creed, but did not significantly challenge the caste system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies Kabir and Nanak's significant contributions to the religious and social landscape of 15th and 16th century India. Both figures were highly critical of the existing social hierarchy and religious practices, advocating for a more egalitarian and inclusive approach that transcended the divide between Hinduism and Islam. Their emphasis on monotheism and rejection of ritualistic excesses resonated deeply with many, although their immediate impact on widespread societal transformation might be debated. The long-term influence of their teachings, however, is undeniable.

Statement 2 accurately portrays the Vaishnava Bhakti movement's characteristics.  The saint-poets, using the Radha-Krishna story as an allegory, effectively conveyed profound spiritual messages to a wide audience.  Their inclusive approach welcomed people of all castes, softening the rigidity of the caste system, even if it wasn't fundamentally overturned. Their lyrical poetry and devotional songs had a significant cultural impact, shaping religious expression and contributing to a climate of religious tolerance and syncretism.  The fact that they operated within the broader framework of Hinduism, while promoting inclusivity,  is crucial to understanding the movement's nuanced impact.


**5. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in North India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ghurid conquest of North India, culminating in the Second Battle of Tarain (1192), marked a significant turning point in Indian history, leading to the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and the beginning of sustained Muslim rule in the region.
2. Prior to the Ghurid conquests, interactions between Hindus and Muslims were limited to occasional raids by the Ghaznavids and the presence of Muslim traders and Sufi preachers, with limited political or social impact beyond localized interactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly establishes the historical significance of the Second Battle of Tarain.  The Ghurid victory under Muizzuddin Muhammad decisively shifted the political landscape of North India, paving the way for the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate. This marked the beginning of a prolonged period of Muslim rule that profoundly impacted the political, social, and cultural fabric of the subcontinent. The battle's outcome represented a major turning point, setting the stage for centuries of subsequent developments.

Statement 2 is also correct in its assessment of the pre-Ghurid period.  While the Ghaznavids conducted numerous raids into India, primarily for plunder, their impact was largely confined to episodic violence and the acquisition of loot.  The presence of Muslim traders and Sufi preachers, while contributing to some cultural exchange, did not fundamentally alter the political or social structure of the region.  This limited interaction contrasts sharply with the sustained and transformative impact of the subsequent Ghurid and Delhi Sultanate rule.  Understanding the limited nature of these early interactions is essential for correctly contextualizing the larger changes brought about by the Ghurid conquests.


**6. With reference to the rule of Firuz Shah Tughlaq, consider the following statements:**

1.  Firuz Shah Tughlaq, despite his orthodox religious views, initiated the translation of Hindu religious texts into Persian, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to governance and a desire to understand Hindu beliefs and practices.
2. Firuz Shah's economic policies, while aiming for improvements, included measures like enslaving young boys, which, while not unprecedented, ultimately contributed to administrative instability and weakened the Sultanate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately highlights a significant, albeit often overlooked, aspect of Firuz Shah Tughlaq's reign. Despite his adherence to orthodox Islamic beliefs and actions that sometimes reflected this, he also initiated a program of translating Hindu religious texts and scientific works into Persian. This initiative, while perhaps not motivated purely by religious tolerance, demonstrates a pragmatic recognition of the need to understand the intellectual and cultural landscape of his diverse empire.  This nuanced understanding of his reign is crucial for a balanced assessment of his rule.

Statement 2 correctly points out the complex and ultimately counterproductive nature of some of Firuz Shah's economic policies.  His practice of enslaving young boys, while not entirely novel in the context of medieval sultanates, created a powerful group of slaves who eventually became a source of political instability.  This ultimately weakened the Sultanate's administrative structure, contributing to its later decline.  The long-term consequences of this policy highlight the unintended and negative effects of seemingly pragmatic administrative measures.  This illustrates the complexities of governance in medieval India and the challenges of balancing short-term gains with long-term stability.


**7.  With reference to Akbar's religious policies and the concept of *sulh-i-kul*, consider the following statements:**

1. Akbar's *Ibadat Khana* debates, while intended to foster interfaith understanding, ultimately led to greater religious divisiveness, prompting him to discontinue the practice.
2. Akbar's *sulh-i-kul* policy, aimed at achieving peace and harmony among different religions, involved various initiatives such as the translation of religious texts and social reforms like the abolition of *sati*, though the impact of these reforms was limited.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the outcome of Akbar's *Ibadat Khana* debates. Initially conceived as a platform for religious discourse and mutual understanding, these debates degenerated into contentious exchanges, with representatives of different faiths often engaging in polemical arguments rather than meaningful dialogue.  This ultimately led Akbar to discontinue the debates, recognizing their counterproductive nature.  This highlights the challenges of promoting interfaith harmony in a religiously diverse society.

Statement 2 correctly describes Akbar's *sulh-i-kul* policy and its various components.  Akbar's commitment to religious tolerance manifested in initiatives like the translation of religious texts into Persian, making them accessible to a wider audience.  He also implemented social reforms, such as attempting to abolish *sati* (widow immolation) and promoting widow remarriage. While these reforms were progressive for their time, their impact was not immediate or universal.  The persistence of traditional practices and social norms underscores the limitations of even the most well-intentioned top-down social engineering.  The overall assessment of Akbar's policies requires a balanced understanding of his successes and limitations.


**8. With reference to the social structure and conditions in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The caste system, while exhibiting some rigidity, allowed for social mobility; groups could rise or fall in the varna hierarchy, and new castes emerged, often reflecting occupational specializations or the integration of tribal communities.
2. The condition of women in medieval India varied across social strata, with upper-class women experiencing a degree of seclusion and restricted access to education, while lower-caste women faced harsher realities and greater vulnerability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly points out the dynamic and fluid nature of the caste system in medieval India.  While the varna system provided a framework for social organization, it was not static.  Social mobility occurred, with groups rising or falling in status based on various factors.  The emergence of new castes, often reflecting occupational specializations or the assimilation of tribal communities into the existing social order, demonstrates the system's capacity for adaptation and evolution.  This dynamic nature challenges simplistic notions of an entirely rigid and unchanging caste structure.

Statement 2 accurately captures the diversity of women's experiences in medieval India.  Upper-class women, while often confined to the domestic sphere and subject to restrictions on education and public life, enjoyed a certain degree of social status and protection compared to their lower-caste counterparts.  Lower-caste women faced significantly harsher realities, experiencing greater vulnerability to exploitation and discrimination.  The disparity in the experiences of women across different social strata highlights the complex interplay of gender and caste in shaping social realities.  A nuanced understanding of medieval Indian society requires recognizing this diversity of experiences rather than relying on generalizations.


**1. With reference to the Jat and Sikh movements during the Mughal era, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jat movement, primarily agrarian in nature, involved peasant cultivators and a few zamindars, often clashing with the Mughal government over land revenue collection.
2.  The Sikh movement, unlike the Jat movement, was significantly influenced by religious factors, ultimately culminating in the establishment of independent regional states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Jat and Sikh movements during the Mughal period. The Jat movement, originating in the Agra-Delhi region, was deeply rooted in agrarian concerns.  Jats, largely peasant cultivators with some zamindars among them, frequently rebelled against Mughal authorities due to disputes over land revenue and harsh taxation policies.  Their resistance was fueled by a strong sense of community and a desire for fair treatment.  The movement's geographically challenging terrain provided a natural advantage in their guerrilla-style warfare.

The Sikh movement, in contrast, while also involving agrarian elements, possessed a strong religious dimension. The movement's growth and eventual success in establishing independent regional states were significantly shaped by religious beliefs and the leadership of the Sikh Gurus.  The religious fervor and the cohesive community structure fostered by the Sikh faith played a crucial role in their ability to organize and sustain resistance against the Mughal empire. While economic factors undoubtedly contributed to both movements, the religious aspect was far more pronounced in the Sikh case.  Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**2. With reference to the Afghan uprisings during Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Afghan uprisings were solely driven by tribal conflicts and lacked any significant political or religious motivations.
2.  The Raushanai movement, a religious revivalist movement emphasizing ethical life and devotion, provided an ideological backdrop to some of the Afghan uprisings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While tribal aspects were present in the Afghan uprisings, they were not the sole driving force.  The uprisings also had clear political and religious dimensions. The desire for a separate Afghan state, independent of Mughal rule, was a significant motivating factor.  Furthermore, the religious revivalist movement Raushanai, with its emphasis on strict ethical conduct and devotion to a chosen pir, provided intellectual and moral support to these uprisings.  The uprisings weren’t simply tribal clashes but also represented a complex interplay of political ambition, religious fervor, and socio-economic grievances.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Raushanai movement played a crucial role in shaping the ideological landscape of some Afghan uprisings. This movement promoted a strong ethical code and deep religious devotion, providing a framework for mobilization and resistance against Mughal authority. This religious dimension was an important factor influencing the participation and commitment of Afghan tribesmen to the uprisings. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**3. With reference to the religious and social movements of the 15th and 16th centuries in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily focused on the worship of Vishnu and his incarnations, Rama and Krishna, and largely ignored the lower castes.
2.  Kabir and Nanak, while critical of existing social structures, primarily focused on individual spiritual reform rather than large-scale social reform.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bhakti movement did prominently feature the worship of Vishnu and his avatars, Rama and Krishna, it was not exclusively limited to this.  Crucially, several Bhakti saints, such as Ramananda, actively challenged the caste system by accepting disciples from all varnas, including the lower castes.  Their teachings emphasized devotion and love for God, transcending social barriers.  This inclusive approach significantly broadened the movement's appeal and impact.

Statement 2 is correct.  Kabir and Nanak, although highly critical of the existing social order and advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity, primarily concentrated their efforts on individual spiritual transformation. While their teachings implicitly challenged social inequalities and promoted a more egalitarian society, their direct focus remained on the individual's spiritual journey and liberation through devotion to one God.  They emphasized the importance of a guru's guidance and a life of ethical conduct, rather than engaging in direct, large-scale social reform movements.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**4. With reference to the cultural developments in India during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The decline in the prestige of Brahmins and Sanskrit led to the rise of regional languages as prominent vehicles for literary expression.
2.  The Sufi saints actively used Bhakti poetry in Hindi during their musical gatherings, contributing to the growth and development of Hindi literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of cultural developments during the medieval period in India. The decline in the dominance of Brahmins and Sanskrit, partly due to political changes and the rise of new religious movements, created space for the flourishing of regional languages.  The Bhakti movement, with its emphasis on vernacular languages, played a pivotal role in this process.  Saints composed devotional poetry in regional languages, making religious and literary works accessible to a wider audience.  This accessibility contributed significantly to the rise of these languages as mediums for literary and cultural expression.

The second statement is also accurate.  Sufi saints in India, particularly in regions like Jaunpur, actively embraced and utilized Bhakti poetry in Hindi during their musical gatherings (sama). This practice facilitated a cultural exchange and integration between Sufi and Bhakti traditions, contributing to the development and popularization of Hindi as a literary language.  The use of Hindi in religious contexts broadened its reach and cemented its role in the literary landscape.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**5. With reference to the early Mughal conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Babur's conquest of India was primarily motivated by the desire to expand his territory and consolidate his power in Central Asia.
2.  The battles of Tarain (1191 and 1192) marked the beginning of the widespread establishment of Turkish rule in North India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Babur's ambition and desire for territorial expansion were certainly factors, his conquest of India was also driven by other compelling reasons. The meager resources and income of his existing territories in Central Asia, coupled with the lure of India's wealth and resources, significantly motivated his campaign.  The desire to control the Punjab parganias, which had historically been part of Timur's empire, also played a significant role.  Therefore, attributing his conquest solely to Central Asian ambitions oversimplifies the complex motivations.

Statement 2 is correct. The battles of Tarain, fought between the Ghurid ruler Muizzuddin Muhammad Ghori and the Chauhan ruler Prithviraj Chauhan, were indeed pivotal turning points in Indian history.  These battles marked the beginning of the significant and widespread expansion of Turkish rule in North India.  The Ghurid victories laid the foundation for the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, initiating a long period of Muslim rule in the region.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**6. With reference to the economic and social conditions in India during the Mughal period, consider the following statements:**

1.  European travelers consistently reported widespread wealth and prosperity across all segments of Indian society during the Mughal era.
2.  The village economy was characterized by significant inequality, with landless laborers and artisans frequently facing hardship and vulnerability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While European travelers did observe the opulence of the Mughal court and the wealth of some sections of society, their accounts also consistently highlighted the stark poverty and hardship faced by the majority of the population, particularly peasants, artisans, and laborers.  The vast disparity between the wealthy elite and the impoverished masses was a recurring theme in these accounts.  Therefore, the statement that all segments of society experienced wealth and prosperity is a misrepresentation of the historical record.

Statement 2 is correct. The village economy during the Mughal period was indeed marked by significant inequalities.  Land ownership was unevenly distributed, leading to a system where landless laborers and artisans were frequently vulnerable to exploitation and hardship.  Famines, which were a recurring feature of the era, disproportionately impacted these vulnerable groups.  The caste system further exacerbated these inequalities, reinforcing social hierarchies and limiting economic opportunities for certain communities.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**7. With reference to Akbar's reign and policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Akbar's Rajput policy was solely based on matrimonial alliances, with no other strategies employed to secure their loyalty and cooperation.
2.  Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax demonstrated his commitment to religious tolerance and inclusivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While matrimonial alliances were a significant component of Akbar's Rajput policy, it was not the only strategy he employed.  He also used other approaches to secure the loyalty and cooperation of Rajput rulers, including granting high offices, providing religious freedom, and demonstrating respect for Rajput traditions and customs.  His multifaceted strategy aimed at integrating the Rajputs into the Mughal administration and society.

Statement 2 is correct. Akbar's abolition of the jizya tax, a tax levied on non-Muslims, was a significant step towards promoting religious tolerance and inclusivity. This action aimed to reduce the religious discrimination and foster better relations between the Muslim rulers and their Hindu subjects.  It was a deliberate policy reflecting Akbar's broader approach to religious harmony.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the decline of the Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The crisis of the jagirdari system, characterized by shortages of jagirs and difficulties in revenue collection, contributed significantly to the weakening of the Mughal Empire.
2.  The decline of the Mughal Empire was primarily due to a lack of competent monarchs and the cessation of immigration from Central Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The jagirdari system, a crucial element of the Mughal administrative and military structure, faced a severe crisis during the later Mughal period.  Shortages of jagirs (land grants), coupled with difficulties in collecting revenue from them, weakened the empire's financial base and led to widespread discontent among the nobility.  This instability undermined the empire's ability to maintain its military strength and administrative efficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the lack of competent monarchs after Aurangzeb played a role in the Mughal decline, it was not the sole cause.  The cessation of immigration from Central Asia is often cited, but this is a simplification.  The Mughal nobility had largely become Indianized by Aurangzeb's time.  The empire's decline was a complex process involving various factors, including economic problems, military challenges (like the Maratha expansion), administrative weaknesses, and succession crises.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**9. With reference to the Ghaznavid raids into India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahmud of Ghazni's raids into India were primarily motivated by a desire to spread Islam and convert the Indian population.
2.  The Hindushahi kingdom in the Punjab offered significant resistance to Mahmud of Ghazni's initial incursions into India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahmud of Ghazni's raids were undoubtedly carried out under the banner of Islam, the primary motivation was not religious conversion.  The principal driving force was the immense wealth and riches of India's temples and cities.  The plunder gained from these raids funded his wars and strengthened his empire.  While the destruction of temples had religious significance, it was primarily a means to acquire wealth and demonstrate power.


Statement 2 is correct. The Hindushahi kingdom in the Punjab did indeed offer substantial resistance to Mahmud of Ghazni's initial attacks.  They fought several battles against the Ghaznavids, although ultimately they were defeated and their kingdom was absorbed into the Ghaznavid empire.  Their resistance shows that the early incursions were not met with passive acceptance.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember, the difficulty is achieved through plausible distractors and requiring precise recall of details.

**1. With reference to the religious and social movements of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Raghunandan of Navadwipa vehemently asserted Brahmanical privileges, advocating their exclusive right to scriptural study and preaching, even claiming that in the Kali Yuga only Brahmins and Shudras remained.
2.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the Muslim orthodox revivalist movement, opposed the concept of *tawhid* (pantheistic mysticism), deeming it un-Islamic, and advocated for the re-imposition of the *jizyah* tax.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of religious and social dynamics in medieval India.  Statement 1 correctly describes Raghunandan's staunchly orthodox views, emphasizing Brahmanical supremacy and a two-varna interpretation of the Kali Yuga. This reflects the conservative reaction to challenges to the established social order.  Statement 2 accurately portrays Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's role in the orthodox Muslim movement. His opposition to *tawhid* and his advocacy for the re-imposition of *jizyah* demonstrate a clear conservative Islamic stance aiming to curb perceived Hindu influence and reinforce Islamic identity within the state.  The other options are incorrect because both statements represent historically verifiable positions held by these influential figures.


**2. With reference to the Mughal succession crisis, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal tradition of succession was unambiguous and followed a strict primogeniture system, ensuring smooth transitions of power.
2.  Shah Jahan's nomination of Dara Shikoh as his successor, while intending to prevent conflict, ultimately fueled the war of succession among his sons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Mughal tradition of succession was far from unambiguous.  While the right of nomination existed, it was often contested, leading to frequent and bloody power struggles.  The Timurid tradition of partitioning was unsuccessful in India, and Hindu traditions also lacked clarity on the matter, often resulting in conflict among brothers.  Statement 2 is correct. Shah Jahan's attempt to pre-empt conflict by naming Dara Shikoh as his successor (wali-ahd) backfired, as it intensified the ambitions of his other sons, who viewed the decision as unfair and a clear show of favoritism. This directly contributed to the outbreak of the war of succession.


**3. With reference to the Bhakti movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, focused on the worship of Rama, extending his teachings to all four varnas and challenging traditional caste restrictions on communal dining.
2.  Kabir, a weaver by trade, emphasized the unity of Allah, Ram, and other divine names, rejecting idol worship, pilgrimages, and formal religious observances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately portray key aspects of the Bhakti movement. Statement 1 correctly identifies Ramananda's emphasis on Rama worship and his inclusive approach, transcending traditional caste barriers in his teachings and practices.  This reflects the movement's egalitarian nature and its challenge to the rigid caste system. Statement 2 accurately describes Kabir's syncretic theology, emphasizing the unity of various divine names and rejecting formal religious practices common to both Hinduism and Islam.  This highlights the movement's inclusive and reformist nature, aiming to transcend religious divisions.


**4. With reference to the Sufi and Bhakti movements' interaction, consider the following statements:**

1.  The monistic ideas of Ibn al-Arabi gained significant popularity in India, influencing Sufi thought and leading to a greater emphasis on pantheistic mysticism (*tawhid-i-wahdat al-wujud*).
2.  The Bhakti songs of Vaishnavite saints, written in vernacular languages like Hindi, significantly impacted Sufi poetry, inspiring some Sufi poets like Malik Muhammad Jaisi to compose works in Hindi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate reflections of the significant interaction between Sufi and Bhakti movements. Statement 1 correctly notes the influence of Ibn al-Arabi's monistic philosophy on Indian Sufism, leading to the widespread acceptance of *tawhid-i-wahdat al-wujud*.  This demonstrates the cross-cultural exchange of ideas and the blending of philosophical concepts. Statement 2 accurately describes the impact of Bhakti poetry on Sufi literary expression.  The use of vernacular languages like Hindi by Bhakti saints fostered a similar trend among some Sufis, indicating a shared cultural and spiritual space.


**5. With reference to the literary and cultural landscape of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sanskrit remained a dominant language for higher learning and literary production throughout the medieval period, with significant contributions in philosophy, poetry, and law.  
2.  Persian, introduced with the Turkish conquests, became a major administrative and literary language, fostering cultural exchange between India and Central Asia, while Arabic remained primarily confined to religious scholarship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately represent the linguistic and cultural landscape of medieval India.  Statement 1 correctly points out the continued importance of Sanskrit as a language of scholarship and literary creation, encompassing various fields. This demonstrates the resilience of classical Indian traditions.  Statement 2 accurately highlights the role of Persian as the language of administration and a major literary language, facilitating cultural interaction. The statement also correctly identifies the limited scope of Arabic to religious and scholarly circles. The coexistence of these languages reflects the multicultural nature of medieval India.


**6.  With reference to the socio-economic conditions of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kayastha caste, emerging prominently during this period, appears to have initially comprised individuals from various castes employed in royal administrations, gradually solidifying into a distinct social group.
2.  While the position of Shudras saw some improvement, with increased access to certain rituals, the Dalits experienced a worsening of their social standing, facing increased marginalization and discrimination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements reflect accurate observations about the socio-economic dynamics of the era.  Statement 1 correctly describes the evolution of the Kayastha caste, highlighting its heterogeneous origins and eventual consolidation. This illustrates the fluidity and complexity of the caste system.  Statement 2 accurately contrasts the changing social statuses of Shudras and Dalits.  While Shudras experienced some degree of social mobility, Dalits faced intensified discrimination and marginalization. This highlights the persistent inequalities within the social hierarchy.


**7. With reference to the Jat and Sikh movements, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jat uprisings, initially agrarian in nature, involved peasant cultivators and were primarily driven by economic grievances related to land revenue, eventually culminating in the establishment of independent Jat principalities.
2.  The Sikh movement, unlike the Jat uprisings, was primarily a religious movement, with little to no political or economic motivations involved.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Jat uprisings, highlighting their agrarian roots and the shift towards political autonomy.  The initial focus on economic grievances morphed into a movement for regional independence, culminating in the formation of separate Jat states.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sikh movement had strong religious foundations, it also had significant political and economic dimensions.  The struggle against Mughal rule and the eventual establishment of a distinct Sikh identity involved considerable political and economic aspects.


**8.  With reference to the Afghan uprisings during Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Afghan uprisings were primarily driven by economic hardship, with little to no religious or political motivations.
2.  The Raushanai movement, a religious revivalist movement among the Afghans, provided a significant ideological backdrop to the uprisings, emphasizing ethical conduct and devotion to a chosen spiritual leader (*pir*).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While economic hardship undoubtedly played a role, the Afghan uprisings also had strong political and religious dimensions.  The desire for autonomy and the influence of the Raushanai movement demonstrate that the uprisings were not solely economically motivated.  Statement 2 is correct. The Raushanai movement provided a crucial ideological framework for the Afghan uprisings, reinforcing a sense of unity and purpose among the rebellious tribes.  The emphasis on ethical conduct and devotion to a *pir* helped mobilize support and legitimize the resistance against Mughal authority.


**9. With reference to the condition of women in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  While women were generally considered mentally inferior and subjected to patriarchal control, their property rights increased with the growth of feudal society, particularly concerning inheritance.
2.  The practice of *sati* (widow immolation), though condemned by some, was practiced widely, particularly among the upper classes, often driven by concerns over property rights and social status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Despite the prevailing patriarchal norms and the perception of women's intellectual inferiority, the growth of feudalism and land ownership did lead to increased property rights for women, especially concerning inheritance.  This reflects a complex interplay of social structures and evolving legal norms.  Statement 2 is partially correct in mentioning the existence of *sati*, but inaccurate in stating it was widely practiced *particularly* among the upper classes and solely driven by property concerns. While *sati* did occur, its prevalence and motivations were more nuanced and varied across different social groups.  The emphasis on property rights as the primary driver oversimplifies the complex social and religious factors influencing the practice.


**10. With reference to the political and cultural interactions during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The early Sufi saints primarily focused on preaching to Muslim settlers, but their message of love and faith influenced some Hindus, initiating a process of religious interaction.
2.  The Turkish conquest of North India led to an immediate and complete cessation of all interactions between Hindu and Muslim religious and social traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the early stages of interaction between Islam and Hinduism. The Sufi saints' inclusive message, while initially targeted at Muslim communities, did contribute to a process of religious and cultural exchange. This laid the groundwork for subsequent interactions and syncretism.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Turkish conquest did not lead to a complete cessation of interactions between Hindu and Muslim traditions. While conflict and tension certainly existed, there were also periods of coexistence, cultural exchange, and synthesis, as evident in the development of the Bhakti and Sufi movements, and the patronage of arts and literature by rulers of both faiths.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring in-depth knowledge of medieval Indian history and culture.


**1. With reference to the religious and social dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Raghunandan, a prominent Dharmashastra writer, advocated for the exclusive rights of Brahmins to interpret scriptures and preach, asserting a rigid two-varna system in the Kaliyuga.
2.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a leading figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement, opposed Akbar's liberal policies and advocated for the re-imposition of jizya, stricter treatment of Hindus, and minimized interaction between the two communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the historical context.  Raghunandan's writings indeed emphasized Brahminical supremacy and a regressive interpretation of the varna system, contrasting with the more inclusive trends of the Bhakti movement.  Similarly, Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi's staunch opposition to Akbar's syncretic policies and his advocacy for a more orthodox and separatist approach towards Hindus are well-documented aspects of his religious and political stance. The re-imposition of jizya and his call for limited Hindu-Muslim interaction are key elements of his agenda.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to capture the essence of both historical figures' actions and beliefs within the broader context of religious and social tensions in medieval India.


**2. With reference to the Mughal succession crisis and the role of Rajput rulers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mughal Empire lacked a clear tradition of succession, with both Timurid and Hindu practices offering ambiguous guidelines, leading to frequent conflicts among princes.
2.  Raja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur, initially supporting Dara Shikoh, ultimately switched allegiance to Aurangzeb after receiving promises of territorial concessions and religious freedom, highlighting the pragmatic nature of Rajput alliances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the ambiguous nature of Mughal succession.  The lack of a clearly defined system, coupled with both Timurid traditions of partition and the equally unclear Hindu practices regarding succession, created fertile ground for internecine warfare among the princes.  Statement 2 accurately describes the political maneuvering of Raja Jaswant Singh. His initial support for Dara Shikoh shifted to Aurangzeb due to the latter's strategic offers, demonstrating the conditional nature of Rajput alliances and their focus on self-interest and territorial gains. The promises of religious freedom and restoration of lands previously seized by Shah Jahan and Dara are significant elements of this shift in allegiance.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent incomplete or inaccurate portrayals of the complex dynamics of Mughal succession and Rajput politics.


**3. With reference to the Bhakti movement and its impact, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ramananda, a follower of Ramanuja, expanded the accessibility of Bhakti by including disciples from all four varnas, challenging traditional caste restrictions on religious participation and social interaction.
2.  Kabir, a weaver, and Nanak, a Khatri, advocated for a monotheistic faith that transcended caste and religious divisions, though their impact on dismantling the caste system was limited.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately portray key aspects of the Bhakti movement. Ramananda's inclusive approach, accepting disciples from all castes irrespective of their social standing, was revolutionary in challenging the rigid hierarchy of the caste system. His disregard for traditional barriers to social and religious participation significantly broadened the reach of the Bhakti movement. Similarly, Kabir and Nanak's emphasis on monotheism and their rejection of caste-based discrimination are central to their teachings. Though they could not completely erase the deeply ingrained caste system, their efforts significantly impacted the social and religious landscape, inspiring a more egalitarian vision.  Options (a), (b), and (d) offer incomplete or selectively focused interpretations of the Bhakti movement's leaders and their impact.


**4.  With reference to the socio-religious context of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1. Firuz Shah Tughlaq, despite certain orthodox inclinations such as persecuting heretical Muslim sects and imposing jizya on Brahmins, also initiated the translation of Hindu religious texts into Persian, demonstrating a degree of intellectual curiosity and cross-cultural exchange.
2. The Delhi Sultanate's administration, while influenced by Islamic theological principles, maintained a degree of separation between religious authority and state policy, evident in the sultans' ability to pursue pragmatic political strategies regardless of strict theological interpretations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements reflect nuanced aspects of the Delhi Sultanate's governance and its interaction with religious and social structures. Firuz Shah Tughlaq's actions showcase a complex relationship with religious orthodoxy. While he displayed intolerance towards certain groups and practices, his initiative to translate Hindu texts into Persian highlights a pragmatic approach towards knowledge acquisition and inter-cultural understanding.  This demonstrates that religious policy under the Sultanate was not monolithic and that individual rulers could exhibit both orthodox and relatively tolerant approaches.  Statement 2 correctly points to the pragmatic approach of the Delhi Sultanate.  While Islamic principles influenced the legal and administrative systems, the sultans demonstrably prioritized political expediency over strict theological adherence.  This is evidenced by their frequent wars and alliances irrespective of the religious affiliations of the involved parties. Options (a), (b), and (d) fail to capture the intricate interplay between religious influence and state policy during the Delhi Sultanate.


**5. With reference to the cultural synthesis during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The development of regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi was facilitated by the Bhakti movement's use of vernacular languages, challenging the dominance of Sanskrit and paving the way for diverse literary expressions.
2.  The Mughal court, under Akbar's patronage, fostered a significant blend of Persian and Indian musical traditions, with figures like Tansen contributing to the evolution of Hindustani classical music.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the cultural synthesis of the medieval period. The Bhakti movement's use of vernacular languages played a crucial role in the development and popularization of regional languages. By using accessible languages for religious expression and literary creation, the Bhakti saints bypassed the dominance of Sanskrit, leading to a rich tapestry of regional literary traditions.  Statement 2 highlights the synthesis of musical traditions.  The Mughal court, particularly under Akbar's patronage, became a melting pot of musical styles.  The integration of Persian and Indian musical elements, exemplified by the contributions of Tansen, resulted in the evolution of Hindustani classical music as a distinct and influential tradition. Options (a), (b), and (d) provide incomplete or oversimplified accounts of the complex cultural interactions during this era.


**6. With reference to the various uprisings during Aurangzeb's reign, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jat uprisings in the Agra-Delhi region were primarily agrarian in nature, stemming from land revenue disputes and fueled by a strong sense of Jat community identity, ultimately leading to the establishment of an independent Jat state.
2. The Afghan uprisings in the northwest were largely tribal in character, driven by a combination of economic hardship, fierce love of freedom, and the aspiration for an independent Afghan state, and were significantly impacted by the Raushanai religious movement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly characterize the distinct nature and causes of the Jat and Afghan uprisings during Aurangzeb's rule.  The Jat uprisings were rooted in agrarian grievances, specifically concerning land revenue collection and the exploitation of Jat cultivators.  The strong sense of Jat community identity played a vital role in mobilizing the uprisings, ultimately culminating in the establishment of an independent Jat principality.  The Afghan uprisings in the northwest were primarily tribal conflicts, fueled by economic pressures, a deep-seated desire for freedom, and the growing ambition to establish an independent Afghan state. The Raushanai movement, with its emphasis on strict ethical conduct and devotion, provided an ideological framework for this resistance. Options (a), (b), and (d) fail to fully capture the multifaceted nature of these movements and their underlying causes.


**7. With reference to the intellectual and religious currents of the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of *tauhid-i-wahdat al-wujud* (Unity of Being), popularized by Ibn Arabi, found significant resonance among Indian Sufis, leading to a greater engagement with Hindu mystical traditions and the use of vernacular languages in Sufi literature.
2.  The writings of the Vaishnava saint-poets, such as Surdas and Mirabai, achieved remarkable lyrical heights, using the Krishna-Radha relationship allegorically to portray the divine love between the individual soul and the Supreme Soul, and influenced Sufi thought.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately represent the intellectual and religious landscape of the medieval period. The acceptance of Ibn Arabi's concept of *wahdat al-wujud* among Indian Sufis fostered a significant degree of cross-religious interaction and understanding. This led to a deeper engagement with Hindu mystical traditions and a greater use of vernacular languages in Sufi literature, bridging the gap between religious communities.  The profound lyrical works of Vaishnava saint-poets like Surdas and Mirabai profoundly influenced Sufi thought. Their allegorical use of the Krishna-Radha love story resonated with Sufi concepts of divine love, further fostering a shared spiritual vocabulary and understanding.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of the intellectual and religious exchanges during this era.


**8. With reference to the political and administrative aspects of the Delhi Sultanate, consider the following statements:**

1.  While the Delhi Sultans claimed legitimacy through their connection to the Abbasid Caliphate, their authority remained largely independent and supreme within their dominion.
2.  Firuz Shah Tughlaq's administrative reforms, while aiming to improve the welfare of the populace, inadvertently weakened the central government by empowering the nobility and making the army less efficient.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the political and administrative realities of the Delhi Sultanate.  The Sultans' claim of legitimacy through the Abbasid Caliphate was largely symbolic, serving to connect them to the wider Islamic world.  In reality, their authority was supreme within their territorial boundaries, and they governed independently.  Firuz Shah Tughlaq's reforms, while intending to enhance social welfare, had unintended consequences.  His policies, aimed at appeasing the nobility and soldiery, ultimately weakened the central government's control, contributing to the Sultanate's eventual decline.  Options (a), (b), and (d) offer incomplete or inaccurate interpretations of the Sultanate's administrative structure and the implications of Firuz Shah Tughlaq's policies.


**9. With reference to the early Turkish conquests in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The initial Turkish incursions into India, under the Ghaznavids, were primarily driven by the lure of plunder and resulted in sporadic raids into the Gangetic plains and Rajputana, met with strong resistance from Rajput rulers.
2.  The Ghurid conquest, under Muhammad Ghori, marked a significant turning point, leading to the establishment of a more sustained Turkish presence in India, beginning with the victories at Tarain and Chandawar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the phases of early Turkish conquests in India. The Ghaznavid incursions were primarily driven by the desire for wealth and resulted in numerous raids into India. Though Rajput rulers offered strong resistance, these were largely defensive actions against sporadic attacks.  The Ghurid conquest under Muhammad Ghori represents a pivotal shift.  Ghori's victories at Tarain and Chandawar established a more lasting Turkish presence, laying the foundation for the Delhi Sultanate. The shift from sporadic raids to sustained conquest is a key difference between the two phases.  Options (a), (b), and (d) provide incomplete or inaccurate representations of the different phases of Turkish expansion into India.


**10. With reference to the cultural developments during the reign of Akbar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abul Fazl and Faizi, brothers and key figures in Akbar's court, played pivotal roles in shaping the literary and intellectual landscape, with Abul Fazl's prose style becoming highly influential, and Faizi overseeing the translation of the Mahabharata into Persian.
2. The Mughal court under Akbar attracted numerous scholars and poets from Persia, leading to a flourishing of Persian literature in India, while also fostering a degree of cultural exchange with the existing Hindu literary traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements highlight crucial aspects of the cultural flourishing under Akbar's rule. Abul Fazl and Faizi, as leading intellectuals at Akbar's court, profoundly impacted literature and scholarship. Abul Fazl's elegant prose style set a standard emulated for generations, while Faizi's contribution to the translation of the Mahabharata represents a significant example of cross-cultural exchange. The influx of Persian scholars and poets into Akbar's court enriched the literary scene. This led to a flourishing of Persian literature in India, and also facilitated interaction and exchange between Persian and existing Hindu literary traditions.  Options (a), (b), and (d) present an incomplete or inaccurate view of the significant cultural developments under Akbar's patronage.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the length and complexity of the source material, creating a comprehensive set of questions within the token limit is challenging.  The questions below cover key themes and aim for a diverse range of difficulty levels.


**1. With reference to the religious and social dynamics of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Raghunandan of Navadwipa vehemently opposed the privileges claimed by the Brahmins, advocating for a more egalitarian social order.
2.  Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement, advocated for the re-imposition of the jizyah tax and a stricter approach towards Hindus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Raghunandan, a highly influential writer on Dharmashastras, actually *asserted* the privileges of Brahmins, stating their exclusive right to read scriptures and preach.  He reinforced the traditional caste hierarchy, not opposed it.  This statement plays on the common UPSC theme of social reform movements but misrepresents Raghunandan's position.

Statement 2 is correct. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a leading figure in the orthodox Muslim revivalist movement, actively opposed Akbar's liberal policies.  He advocated for the re-imposition of the jizyah tax (a tax on non-Muslims),  a more assertive stance towards Hindus, and minimized interactions between Muslims and Hindus. This accurately reflects his conservative stance and attempts at religious and political re-assertion.


**2. With reference to the succession crisis in the late Mughal Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  Hindu traditions regarding succession were unambiguous, with the ruler having the sole right to nominate his successor.
2.  Shah Jahan's attempt to nominate Dara Shikoh as his successor led to a smooth and uncontested transition of power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Hindu traditions regarding succession were not always clear-cut. While a ruler might nominate a successor, this wasn't universally accepted, as evidenced by the struggles faced by rulers like Sanga.  This statement contrasts with the reality of contested successions within Rajput states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Shah Jahan's attempt to nominate Dara Shikoh as his successor directly triggered a bitter war of succession among his sons.  Far from ensuring a smooth transition, it fueled the ambitions of his other sons, leading to conflict and Aurangzeb's eventual triumph. This highlights the complexities of Mughal succession practices and the role of ambition in shaping political outcomes.


**3. With reference to the Bhakti movement in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhakti movement primarily focused on formal rituals and Vedic scholarship, emphasizing adherence to traditional practices.
2.  Ramananda, a prominent Bhakti saint, actively challenged the caste system by initiating disciples from all four varnas and disregarding caste-based restrictions on food sharing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bhakti movement, in contrast to its portrayal here, strongly emphasized *personal devotion* to God, rejecting rigid adherence to rituals and Vedic orthodoxy.  It was a popular movement that appealed to the masses, not just the elite.  This statement presents a distorted view of the Bhakti movement's core tenets.

Statement 2 is correct.  Ramananda, as mentioned in the text, broke with traditional caste restrictions. He initiated disciples from all four varnas, including lower castes, and disregarded the restrictions on inter-caste dining.  This exemplifies the Bhakti movement’s challenge to the rigid caste system and its emphasis on inclusivity.


**4. With reference to the social structure of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kayastha caste emerged as a rigid and clearly defined social group from its inception, with no ambiguity regarding its origins or membership.
2.  The position of Dalits (untouchables) improved significantly during this period, with increased access to land ownership and social mobility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kayastha caste’s origins are complex and not fully defined. The text indicates that it initially comprised individuals from various castes who served in royal establishments, gradually evolving into a distinct caste over time.  This highlights the fluidity and evolving nature of caste identities during the period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text suggests that the position of Dalits *deteriorated* during this period.  They faced social exclusion, occupational restrictions, and were often denied land ownership.  This statement misrepresents the reality of social marginalization experienced by Dalits.


**5. With reference to the Sufi movement in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chishti and Suharwardi orders were the only significant Sufi orders to establish a presence in India during the medieval period.
2.  The Chishti Sufi saints, such as Nizamuddin Auliya, actively discouraged the use of music (sama) in their religious gatherings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chishti and Suharwardi orders were prominent, other Sufi orders also existed and influenced the religious landscape of medieval India.  This statement oversimplifies the diversity of Sufi traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that the Chishti saints, notably Nizamuddin Auliya, *utilized* music (sama) in their gatherings as a means of fostering spiritual connection.  This statement misrepresents the Chishti order's religious practices and their use of music.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage acknowledges the ongoing debate among historians regarding economic conditions (800-1200 CE), but it presents evidence counter to the idea of complete stagnation.  The text explicitly mentions continued trade relations with the Byzantine and Sassanid empires, followed by expanded trade with the Arab world after the rise of the Arab Empire in the seventh century.

The passage discusses the cultural synthesis during the Delhi Sultanate, particularly focusing on music. It mentions Amir Khusrau's contribution to the fusion of Persian and Indian musical traditions, highlighting his introduction of Persian airs and instruments. This directly supports statement 1.  The passage further explains that the patronage of music extended beyond the Sultan's court, influencing Sufi gatherings and regional courts, leading to the development of unique regional musical styles. This confirms statement 2. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because the passage's account strongly supports both statements about the cultural exchange in music. The question tests factual recall and understanding of cultural interactions and their consequences.
