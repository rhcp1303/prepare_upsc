Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to Medieval Indian Temple Architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *rekha-prasada* style, a subtype of *nagara* architecture, features a square base that curves inward to a point at the top, forming a tall, sharply rising tower.
2.  *Phamsana* structures, another *nagara* subtype, are characterized by broader, shorter forms with roofs composed of multiple slabs rising gently to a central point, unlike the steep incline of *rekha-prasada*.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key features distinguishing two important subtypes within the broader *nagara* style of North Indian temple architecture.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the *rekha-prasada* (also called *latina*) style's defining characteristic: its tall, curvilinear shikhara rising from a square base to a single point. This is a common and well-established feature found in numerous temples across North India. Statement 2 accurately contrasts this with the *phamsana* style, noting its broader, shorter profile and the gentler slope of its multi-slab roof culminating in a single apex. The *phamsana* design often complements the *rekha-prasada* in larger temple complexes, frequently forming mandapas (assembly halls) while the main shrine retains the *rekha-prasada* form.  Therefore, both statements provide accurate and distinct descriptions of these architectural styles, making (c) the correct answer.


**2. With reference to Bronze Sculpture in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "lost-wax" (cire-perdu) casting technique, evidenced as early as the Indus Valley Civilization, was predominantly used for creating large-scale, monumental bronze sculptures of deities.
2.  While bronze casting was utilized for religious icons (Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain), its application extended to everyday objects like cooking and eating utensils, as demonstrated by finds from various regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but overstates the scale of application.  The lost-wax technique was indeed known since the Indus Valley Civilization and *was* used to create bronze sculptures, but it wasn't primarily for monumental-sized religious figures.  While some large bronzes exist, the technique's versatility facilitated the production of a wide range of objects, from small figurines to larger but still relatively portable religious images.  Statement 2 is entirely accurate, highlighting the multifaceted use of bronze casting.  Archaeological evidence shows that the technique was not solely confined to religious iconography; its practical applications extended to creating everyday tools and household items. This demonstrates a broader societal integration of metalworking skills beyond the purely religious sphere. Therefore, only statement 2 is completely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.


**3. With reference to the Pala and Sena styles of sculpture in Eastern India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pala style, flourishing between the 9th and 11th centuries, is characterized by a distinct regional style known as the Vanga style, exemplified by temples with tall, curving *shikharas* crowned by large *amalakas*.
2. The Sena style, dominant from the mid-11th to mid-13th centuries, saw a continuation of the curving *shikhara* form, but with a greater emphasis on incorporating local vernacular building traditions into temple design.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 incorrectly attributes the Vanga style primarily to the Pala period. While the Palas *did* patronize Buddhist monastic sites and the Vanga style *does* feature in that region,  the statement conflates the two. The Vanga style has its own distinct characteristics and timeline, not solely confined to the Pala period.  Statement 2 is more accurate. While the Sena period built upon previous architectural forms, the emphasis on integrating local vernacular building traditions, such as the characteristic curving roofline reminiscent of Bengali huts, is a key aspect of their style.  This fusion of indigenous and established architectural elements is a significant feature of Sena-era temple architecture. Therefore, only statement 2 presents a largely accurate depiction of the stylistic developments, making (b) the correct answer.

However, similar to Sanchi in its early phase, the Amaravati Stupa initially lacked direct representations of the Buddha.  The Buddha was instead symbolized through various motifs like the stupa itself, footprints, or the empty throne.  The development of explicit Buddha imagery came later in the stupa's history, highlighting a shift in artistic conventions within the Buddhist tradition. This reflects the evolution of Buddhist iconography over time.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Gandhara school, flourishing in the region of present-day Pakistan, represents a significant development in Buddhist art.  Under the influence of Greco-Roman artistic traditions, the Gandhara school introduced a distinctly human and often idealized portrayal of the Buddha. This contrasted sharply with the earlier symbolic representations prevalent in schools like Mathura and before. This fusion of styles is a key characteristic of the Gandhara school and represents a significant cultural exchange. The human depiction became a dominant feature, spreading widely across various regions.


**3. With reference to the characteristics of different temple architectural styles in India, consider the following statements:**

Statement 2 is also correct. The Sarnath school of sculpture, another important centre of artistic activity, developed alongside the Mathura school. However, it exhibited a distinct aesthetic preference. Unlike the Mathura school's emphasis on elaborate drapery folds in Buddha images, the Sarnath school often favored a simpler, less ornate treatment of drapery. This resulted in a more streamlined and elegant appearance in their Buddha sculptures. This stylistic difference highlights the diversity of artistic expression within the same geographical region and time period. The simpler drapery reflects a different artistic sensibility.


**8. With reference to the religious practices and beliefs in ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Yaksha worship was prevalent both before and after the advent of Buddhism, and was later assimilated into both Buddhist and Jain traditions.
2. The construction of stupas and viharas, integral to Buddhist monastic establishments,  was the sole architectural expression of Buddhist religious practices in ancient India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Yaksha worship, the veneration of nature spirits and deities, was a widespread practice in ancient India, predating the rise of Buddhism.   After the emergence of Buddhism, Yaksha worship continued, and interestingly, elements of Yaksha imagery and beliefs were integrated into both Buddhist and Jain traditions.  This assimilation demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of religious practices in ancient India. The syncretic nature of religious practices is evident in the integration of Yaksha worship.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While stupas and viharas were indeed crucial architectural components of Buddhist monastic establishments, they were not the *sole* architectural expression of Buddhist religious practices.  Ancient India also saw the construction of chaityas (prayer halls), rock-cut caves, and other structures dedicated to Buddhist practices. The statement is an oversimplification of the range of architectural forms associated with Buddhism.  Many other types of buildings and structures were used for Buddhist purposes. The statement incorrectly limits the architectural scope of Buddhism.


**1. With reference to Medieval Indian Temple Architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hoysala temples, known for their stellate plan and intricate carvings, primarily utilized granite as their building material.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary based on the examinee's prior knowledge.  I have aimed for a "difficult" level by incorporating subtle inaccuracies and requiring precise recall of details.

**1. With reference to Indus Valley Civilization seals, consider the following statements:**

1.  The standard Harappan seal was a circular plaque approximately 2 inches in diameter, typically crafted from steatite.
2.  While animal motifs were prevalent, depictions of human figures and trees on seals were exceedingly rare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the standard Harappan seal was a *square* plaque, measuring 2x2 square inches, not circular.  The material, steatite, is correctly identified. The slight alteration in shape is a key distractor, playing on the examinee's potential familiarity with the general characteristics of Indus seals but testing their precise knowledge of dimensions and shape.

Statement 2 is correct. While the passage highlights the prevalence of animal motifs (bull, elephant, tiger, etc.), it mentions that human figures and trees were *sometimes* depicted, implying their presence was less frequent than animal representations. The word "exceedingly rare" is a slight exaggeration but designed to test the candidate's ability to discern nuances in descriptive language.  The emphasis on rarity compared to animal depictions makes the statement accurate within the context of the passage.


**2. With reference to Indus Valley Civilization pottery, consider the following statements:**

1.  Hand-made pottery significantly outnumbered wheel-made pottery in the Indus Valley Civilization.
2.  Polychrome pottery, characterized by multiple colors, was a common feature of Indus Valley ceramics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that wheel-made wares were *chief* and far more common than hand-made pottery.  This directly contradicts the statement.  The reversal of the relative frequencies of handmade and wheel-made pottery is a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly describes polychrome pottery as *rare*, directly contradicting the assertion that it was a common feature. The use of the word "common" in contrast to the passage's description of rarity serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's careful reading comprehension.


**3. With reference to Harappan ornaments and bead-making, consider the following statements:**

1.  The bead-making industry was primarily concentrated in urban centers like Mohenjodaro and Harappa, with limited evidence of workshops in smaller settlements.
2.  While a variety of materials were used, beads made from precious stones like lapis lazuli and turquoise were relatively uncommon compared to those made from cheaper materials such as steatite.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions the discovery of bead-making *factories* at Chanhudaro and Lothal, indicating a widespread, not limited, industry.  The implication that the industry was confined to major cities is a deliberate falsehood designed to test knowledge beyond superficial understanding.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage lists cornelian, amethyst, jasper, crystal, quartz, steatite, turquoise, and lapis lazuli as bead materials, implying no significant rarity for precious stones compared to others. The claim of relative uncommonness for precious stones is a misconception intended to mislead.


**4.  With reference to the "Pashupati Seal," consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pashupati Seal depicts a seated human figure surrounded by animals, unequivocally identified as Shiva by all scholars.
2.  The seal was found exclusively at Mohenjodaro, indicating its potential significance as a site-specific religious icon.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the central figure is *generally* identified as Pashupati (Shiva) by *some* scholars, but *others* identify it as a female deity. The use of "unequivocally" and "all scholars" is a deliberate distortion of the passage's nuanced description of scholarly debate surrounding the seal's interpretation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage states that similar seals were found in *considerable numbers* at sites *such as* Mohenjodaro, not exclusively there.  The restriction of the seal's discovery to Mohenjodaro is inaccurate and intended to test careful reading comprehension.


**5. With reference to the art and craft of the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Dancing Girl" bronze statue from Mohenjodaro is characterized by highly realistic and detailed anatomical representation.
2.  The Indus Valley artists demonstrated a mastery of metal casting, stone carving, pottery, and terracotta modeling, but showed limited skill in creating naturalistic animal models.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the "Dancing Girl" is praised for its expressiveness, the description of the statue emphasizes the *simplified* tubular forms of the limbs and torso, not a highly realistic anatomical representation.  The contrast between "realistic" and the passage's description of simplification is a crucial distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage specifically mentions the creation of "brilliantly naturalistic models of animals," contradicting the claim of limited skill in this area.  The negation of the passage's explicit statement on naturalistic animal models is a significant point of difficulty.


These questions aim to test not only factual recall but also analytical and evaluative skills, requiring candidates to carefully consider the nuances of the provided information and resist the temptation to rely on generalized knowledge.  The distractors are designed to be plausible but ultimately incorrect, forcing candidates to engage with the text critically.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The statement 1 is correct. The lost-wax casting process, also known as the cire-perdu technique, has ancient roots, with evidence suggesting its use during the Indus Valley Civilization.  While the specific techniques might have evolved over time, the fundamental principle of creating a wax model and then covering it in clay for molten metal casting remained a constant.  This ancient practice was refined and mastered by later civilizations, including the Cholas, who produced some of the finest examples of bronze casting in Indian history.


Statement 2 is also correct.  Nagapattinam, a significant port city during the Chola period, has yielded a considerable number of bronze sculptures. These sculptures are largely characterized by their depiction of Hindu deities, reflecting the religious landscape of the Chola empire.  The majority of these finds are dated to the 10th century, a period of significant artistic flourishing under the Chola dynasty.  The stylistic features of these bronzes, including their graceful postures, detailed ornamentation, and expressive features, are hallmarks of Chola artistry and are highly valued in the field of Indian art history.  The discovery of these sculptures at Nagapattinam adds valuable insight into the artistic production and patronage systems of the Chola period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While it is true that the Dilwara temples at Mount Abu were constructed by Vimal Shah and are renowned for their elaborate marble interiors, their architectural style is not Dravidian.  They are considered examples of a distinct Jain architectural style.  The temples' design integrates elements of both Nagara and Dravida styles, but cannot be definitively categorized as belonging solely to one.  The simplistic exterior contrasting with the exuberant interiors is a unique feature.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola, a colossal monolithic sculpture of Lord Bahubali, was indeed commissioned by Camundaraya, the General-in-Chief and Prime Minister of the Ganga kings of Mysore.  Its remarkable height and monolithic nature make it a globally significant sculptural achievement.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect. The Dilwara temples’ architectural classification requires a nuanced understanding of the diverse styles within Indian temple architecture, highlighting the need for precise knowledge beyond simple categorization.  The Gomateshwara statue, however, is a well-documented and widely recognized example of monolithic sculpture and its patronage.


**3. With reference to the Kailashnath Temple at Ellora, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple's colossal sculpture depicting Ravana shaking Mount Kailasha is a masterpiece of Indian sculpture and is dated to the 10th century CE, showcasing a blend of Nagara and Dravidian architectural elements.
2. The temple's exterior walls feature carvings that highlight the use of protrusion and recession in creating three-dimensional space and exploiting light and shadow effects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Kailashnath Temple's depiction of Ravana shaking Mount Kailasha is indeed a masterpiece of Indian sculpture, its dating is incorrect.  It is dated to the 8th century CE, not the 10th century. Furthermore, the temple's architectural style is primarily considered to be a unique rock-cut style, not a direct blend of Nagara and Dravidian styles, although it shows influences from various sources.

Statement 2 is correct. The exterior walls of the Kailashnath Temple at Ellora are richly carved and exemplify the masterful use of protrusion and recession to create a strong sense of three-dimensionality.  The sculptors skillfully manipulated the rock surface to enhance the play of light and shadow, adding depth and dynamism to the figures and scenes depicted.  This technique is a characteristic feature of Ellora's rock-cut architecture.

Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. The precise dating of the Ravana sculpture and the nuanced understanding of the temple's architectural style demonstrate the necessity of accurate factual recall in assessing such statements.  The description of the sculptural techniques used on the temple's exterior, however, is a demonstrably accurate observation.

2. The Vakataka bronze images of the Buddha, contemporary with Gupta period bronzes, show a marked departure from the Amaravati style, exhibiting a distinct draping style of the monk's robe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Pala school of sculpture, flourishing in Bengal and Bihar during the 9th-11th centuries, is indeed characterized by its depiction of slender figures often draped in transparent or thinly rendered garments. This stylistic preference reflects a continuation and adaptation of certain aspects of the Sarnath school of art, though with regional variations.  The elegance and refinement of the Pala style are significant aspects of its artistic identity.

Statement 2 is also correct. Vakataka bronze images of the Buddha, produced during a period overlapping with the Gupta era, do display a noticeable difference from the Amaravati style. While the Amaravati style is known for its elaborate and flowing drapery, the Vakataka bronzes show a shift in the treatment of the monk's robe. This change is reflected in how the drapery clings to the body contour, creating a more streamlined and continuous line.  This stylistic evolution within the context of Buddhist art highlights the dynamism and adaptability of artistic traditions.


Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.  Both statements accurately reflect stylistic developments in post-Gupta Indian art, demonstrating the interplay between established artistic traditions and the emergence of regional styles.  The nuanced differences between the Pala and Vakataka styles, and their relationship to earlier schools of art, require a careful understanding of the evolution of Indian sculptural aesthetics.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ajanta caves do feature apsidal vault-roofs, the architectural style is not entirely consistent across the different construction periods. The earlier phase (2nd-1st centuries BCE) and later phase (5th century CE) show noticeable stylistic differences in the overall design, detailing, and scale of carvings.  The evolution across these periods reflects changes in artistic sensibilities and patronage.

Statement 2 is correct. The vihara caves at Nashik, with their characteristic front pillars featuring ghata-base and ghata-capital, indeed possess a unique facade design that distinguishes them from other Western Indian cave sites.  The presence of human figures further adds to their distinctive character, making them an important example of regional variations within the broader rock-cut tradition.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are, therefore, incorrect.  The detailed analysis of Ajanta's cave architecture highlights the importance of acknowledging temporal variations in artistic styles.  The unique characteristics of the Nashik vihara caves, however, are well-established in the study of Indian rock-cut architecture.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage clearly states that the standard Harappan seal was a *square* plaque, not circular, measuring 2x2 square inches. While steatite was a common material, the statement's exclusivity is misleading.  The seals were also found in gold and ivory. The specification of "predominantly crafted from steatite" is a subtle but important inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that seals depicted a "great variety of motifs," including animals *and* human figures, as well as trees and monsters.  The statement downplays the presence of human figures, which were, in fact, a part of the iconography. The exclusion of human figures creates a significant distractor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The description of the Pashupati Seal explicitly includes an *elephant* among the animals surrounding the central figure.  The omission of the elephant in the statement serves as a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that some scholars identify the central figure as Pashupati, while others identify it as a female deity. This indicates a lack of universal consensus regarding the identification of the central figure.

The curving shikhara (spire) is a hallmark of Nagara architecture, found in temples across North India, while the pyramidal vimana is characteristic of Dravidian temples in South India.  These distinct architectural forms reflect regional variations in building techniques and aesthetic preferences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The panchayatana style, featuring a central shrine and four subsidiary shrines, is primarily associated with Nagara architecture, particularly in temples of Central and North India.  While regional variations exist within both Nagara and Dravida styles, the panchayatana plan is not a defining characteristic of the Dravidian architectural tradition.  The statement incorrectly attributes this style exclusively to Dravidian architecture, neglecting its prevalence in Nagara temples.


**2. With reference to Indian bronze sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "lost-wax" casting technique, also known as cire-perdu, was first developed during the Chola period in South India.
2.  The Gupta and Vakataka periods (5th-7th centuries CE) saw the production of portable bronze Buddha images, facilitating the spread of the classical style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "lost-wax" casting technique has a much older history in India, its origins traceable to the Indus Valley Civilization. While the Chola period (10th-12th centuries CE) witnessed a flourishing of bronze casting, particularly in South India, the technique itself was not a Chola invention.  The statement wrongly attributes the origin of this ancient technique to a relatively later period.

Statement 2 correctly highlights a key aspect of Gupta and Vakataka bronze sculpture. The production of smaller, portable bronze Buddha images during this period was crucial in disseminating the refined classical style across different regions of India and even to other Asian countries.  These portable images served as objects of personal devotion and were also installed in Buddhist viharas (monasteries).


**3. With reference to the development of Buddhist art in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Early Buddhist art employed symbolic representations of the Buddha, such as footprints or stupas, before progressing to anthropomorphic depictions.
2.  The Gandhara school, known for its Greco-Roman influence, primarily produced sculptures of Hindu deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the evolution of Buddhist art.  In the early phases of Buddhism, the Buddha was depicted symbolically through various objects and signs representing his presence or key events in his life. This symbolic representation gradually gave way to anthropomorphic depictions, particularly in the Mathura and Gandhara schools. The statement correctly captures this chronological progression in the representation of the Buddha.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gandhara school, flourishing in the region of Gandhara (present-day Pakistan), was indeed known for its blend of Greco-Roman and local artistic styles, but it primarily produced sculptures of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, not Hindu deities. The statement misrepresents the primary subject matter of the Gandhara school's artistic production.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key feature of Vijayanagara painting. The two-dimensional representation of figures, with profile faces and a flat background, is a defining stylistic element of this school. This stylistic approach is consistent across various examples of Vijayanagara paintings found in temples and other sites. The statement is a correct description of the stylistic conventions used in Vijayanagara painting.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Nayaka period (17th-18th centuries) saw some regional modifications and additions to the Vijayanagara style, it did not completely abandon the stylistic conventions of its predecessor. Nayaka paintings retained many features of the Vijayanagara style, such as the profile depiction of faces and two-dimensional representation of figures.  The statement is incorrect in asserting a complete break from the established style.


**5.  Consider the following statements concerning the  "lost-wax" process in bronze casting:**

1. The lost-wax process involves creating a wax model, covering it with clay, pouring molten metal into the mold, and then removing the wax by firing.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring detailed knowledge of Indian art and architecture.


**1. With reference to the evolution of temple architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *rekha-prasada* style, characterized by a square base and inwardly curving walls culminating in a point, is a subtype of the *nagara* order, predominantly found in North India.
2.  The *khakra* style, a distinct subtype of the *dravida* order, is characterized by a stepped pyramid-like structure, prominently featured in Odisha temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 1 is correct. The *rekha-prasada* (also called *latina*) style is indeed a prominent subtype within the *nagara* order of North Indian temple architecture.  It's characterized by the graceful inward curve of the *shikhara* (spire) from a square base to a pointed apex.  This style is extensively documented in the text, describing temples across various regions of North India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Odisha temples represent a distinct sub-style within the *nagara* order, the description given refers to the *deul* style, characterized by a vertical shikhara curving sharply inwards near the top. The *khakra* style is not a recognized subtype within the *dravida* order, nor is it prominently featured in Odisha temple architecture according to the provided text. The text mentions three main architectural features of Odisha temples – *rekhapida*, *pidhadeul*, and *khakra*, but does not associate *khakra* with the *dravida* order.  The *dravida* order is characterized by the *vimana*, a stepped pyramid-like structure.

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Vijayanagara painting as described in the text.

Statement 1 correctly describes the stylistic conventions of Vijayanagara paintings, including the use of profile views for faces and the two-dimensional representation of figures and objects within rectilinear compartments.  The text highlights the stylistic conventions such as still but fluid lines, compositions appearing in rectilinear compartments.

Statement 2 accurately identifies Tiruparakunram as a site showcasing an early phase of the Vijayanagara style and confirms the use of narrative themes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata in these paintings. The text explicitly mentions this.



**5. With reference to the sculptural traditions of Mathura, consider the following statements:**

1. Mathura sculptures of the Kushana period are characterized by a light volume, fleshy bodies, and broad shoulders, with the *sanghati* (garment) prominently covering the left shoulder and hand.
2.  The Mathura style, in contrast to the Sarnath style, consistently depicts folds in the drapery of Buddha images and profusely decorated halos, exhibiting a preference for detailed ornamentation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Mathura sculptures of the Kushana period did feature fleshy bodies and broad shoulders, the description of the *sanghati* covering the left shoulder is not entirely accurate. The text states that the *sanghati* covers only one shoulder, but does not specify which one consistently. The text mentions that the garment covers the left hand prominently.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly contrasts the Mathura and Sarnath styles, highlighting the presence of folds in the drapery and ornate halos in Mathura Buddha images, while noting the plain drapery and minimal ornamentation of Sarnath Buddha images.  This contrast is a key stylistic difference emphasized in the text.


**1. With reference to the characteristics of Chola bronze sculptures, consider the following statements:**

1. Chola bronzes primarily depict Hindu deities, with a limited representation of Buddhist and Jain figures.
2.  The "lost-wax" casting technique was not employed in the creation of Chola bronzes; instead, a unique method involving clay molds was used.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While Chola bronzes are renowned for their depictions of Hindu deities, particularly Shiva and his consorts,  some examples of Buddhist and Jain iconography exist, albeit in smaller numbers compared to Hindu representations. The dominant religious context of the Chola period heavily influenced the subject matter of their bronze castings.  The focus on Hindu iconography reflects the prevalent religious beliefs and patronage of the time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "lost-wax" or cire-perdu technique was indeed the primary method used for casting Chola bronzes. This sophisticated technique allowed for intricate detailing and the creation of lifelike, aesthetically pleasing sculptures. The passage explicitly mentions the use of the lost-wax process in the context of bronze sculpture, indicating its significant role in Chola art. The claim of a unique clay mold method is factually inaccurate and a misleading distractor.


**2. With reference to the architectural styles prevalent in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara style, predominantly found in North India, is characterized by pyramidal, stepped towers known as vimanas.
2. The Dravida style, common in South India, features curvilinear shikharas that rise to a pointed apex.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The description of the Nagara style is partially accurate in that it was prevalent in North India, but it is characterized by curvilinear *shikharas*, not pyramidal vimanas. Vimanas are the characteristic tower structures of the Dravida style found in South India. This reversal of architectural features between the two styles is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Dravida style is indeed prominent in South India, but it is defined by its pyramidal vimanas, not the curvilinear shikharas associated with the Nagara style. Again, the interchange of key architectural elements is designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of these distinct styles.


**3. With reference to the iconography and ornamentation in Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. River goddesses Ganga and Yamuna are typically depicted at the entrance of Dravida temples, while dvarapalas (doorkeepers) are found in Nagara temples.
2.  Mithunas (erotic couples) are exclusively found in temples dedicated to Shakta (Goddess) cults, never in Vaishnava or Shaiva temples.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The placement of Ganga and Yamuna is typically associated with Nagara temple entrances, while dvarapalas are more commonly found guarding the entrances of Dravida temples. The reversal of these elements is a deliberate attempt to confuse the candidate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While mithunas are frequently found in temples, their presence is not limited to Shakta temples.  They can be seen in Vaishnava and Shaiva temples as well, often symbolizing auspiciousness or aspects of human experience within the broader cosmic framework.  The restrictive nature of statement 2 is a major distractor designed to highlight the broader distribution of this motif.


**4. With reference to the  "lost-wax" casting process in bronze sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. The lost-wax process involves creating a wax model that is then coated with a mixture of clay, sand, and cow dung, after which molten metal is poured into a cavity. The wax melts away during the firing process.
2. This technique was exclusively developed and utilized during the Gupta period in North India, and wasn't employed in other regions or periods.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Pallavas are known for their impressive rock-cut architecture, they also constructed structural temples. The statement's overemphasis on rock-cut structures is a misleading distractor.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram, while primarily Dravidian in style, displays some elements that blend with Nagara characteristics, showing a degree of architectural fusion. This makes it an exceptional example showcasing the interplay of different regional styles. The subtle blending of styles is a key point of analysis for the candidate.


**6. With reference to the Vijayanagara paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. Vijayanagara paintings are characterized by a unique style that significantly deviated from the earlier South Indian painting traditions.
2.  The paintings at Hampi's Virupaksha temple primarily depict scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, with minimal focus on royal or dynastic events.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Statement 2 is incorrect. The paintings at Hampi's Virupaksha temple do indeed include scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, but they also prominently feature events from the Vijayanagara dynasty's history and portrayals of important figures. The statement's exclusion of dynastic elements is a crucial distractor.


**7. With reference to the features of the Khajuraho temples, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khajuraho temples are exclusively dedicated to Hindu deities; there are no Jain or other religious structures within the complex.
2. The erotic sculptures at Khajuraho are integrated into the overall temple design, representing a holistic view of human experience alongside spiritual pursuits.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Khajuraho temples are predominantly Hindu, the complex also includes Jain temples.  The statement's exclusion of Jain structures is a significant point of inaccuracy.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the context of the erotic sculptures at Khajuraho. These sculptures are not merely decorative additions but are integrated into the temple's artistic and philosophical design, representing a balanced view of human existence within a cosmic framework. This statement tests the candidate's understanding of the cultural and artistic significance of Khajuraho's sculptures.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nalanda University was a significant center for all three major Buddhist traditions—Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana—demonstrating its inclusive nature. The statement's limited scope is a deliberate attempt to mislead the candidate.

Statement 2 correctly describes the Nalanda school of sculpture. While influenced by the Gupta style, it developed unique characteristics in facial features, body proportions, and the treatment of clothing and jewelry, establishing its distinct artistic identity.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the regional variations within Indian art.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the text's description of the religious scene. The text explicitly mentions the prevalence of Yaksha and mother goddess worship alongside the rise of Buddhism. However, it emphasizes Buddhism's dominance as the leading socio-religious movement during that time.  The coexistence of different worship styles shows religious syncretism, a common feature in ancient Indian religious practices. The statement successfully captures this nuanced aspect.

While the lost-wax technique did originate in ancient India and was used for creating everyday objects, its application extended far beyond mere utilitarian purposes.  The text clearly shows its extensive use in creating religious icons and sculptures across various faiths (Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain).  The statement's focus on solely utilitarian applications is a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect on two counts.  While Chola bronzes are indeed celebrated for their aesthetic excellence, they primarily depict Hindu deities, not Buddhist ones.  The "tribhanga" posture (three bends in the body), though present in some Chola works, isn't their exclusive characteristic.  Many Chola bronzes showcase other postures as well, depending on the deity being represented. The statement oversimplifies the diverse iconography and postural conventions found in Chola bronze sculptures.  Therefore, neither statement provides a completely accurate description, making (d) the correct option.

The text highlights the similarity of Pala temple shikharas to those found in contemporary Odisha temples, indicating a shared architectural vocabulary and stylistic influence.  The tall, curving shikharas are a defining characteristic of this period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sena style, while having its own distinct characteristics, did not significantly depart from the Pala style in terms of adopting a flat and geometric aesthetic influenced by Islamic forms.  The transition between Pala and Sena styles was more of an evolution than a radical departure. While regional variations and influences existed, the core elements of the Nagara style continued. The suggestion of a substantial Islamic influence in the Sena style's aesthetic is a misleading distractor.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, making (a) the correct answer.

Statement 2 is correct. Khajuraho temples are globally famous for their extensive and explicit erotic sculptures.  These sculptures are not mere ornamentation but are integrated into the temple's overall artistic and philosophical narrative, reflecting a complex understanding of human experience within the broader context of Hindu cosmology.  The statement accurately reflects the significance and integration of these sculptures within the religious and artistic context of Khajuraho.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct, making (b) the appropriate answer.

2.  Unlike the Sanchi Stupa, the Amaravati Stupa features prominent Buddha images from its earliest phases of construction, demonstrating an early emphasis on anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key feature of the Amaravati Stupa. The dome, or anda, of the stupa was extensively decorated with relief sculptures, narrating stories from the life of the Buddha and Jataka tales. This extensive use of sculpted slabs is a hallmark of Amaravati's artistic style.  The dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries CE is also consistent with scholarly understanding.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that, similar to the Sanchi Stupa, the early phases of the Amaravati Stupa lacked depictions of the Buddha in human form.  The anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha emerged later in the construction phases.  The statement attempts to create a false equivalence between Amaravati and Sanchi by misrepresenting the chronological development of Buddha imagery. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the characteristics of the Amaravati Stupa, making (a) the correct option.


**6. With reference to  Jain Temple Architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dilwara Temples at Mount Abu, known for their minimalist exteriors and ornately carved marble interiors, were constructed during the 10th century CE under the patronage of the Chaulukya dynasty.

2.  Chola bronzes, renowned for their exquisite beauty and aesthetic appeal, were primarily produced for ritual worship and are characterized by the use of five metals—gold, silver, copper, brass, and lead—in their alloy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that bronze casting techniques reached a high stage of development in South India during the medieval period, with Chola bronzes (10th-12th centuries CE) being particularly exquisite, and the Nataraja being a prime example of their skill.  The development was a continuous process, evolving from earlier Pallava period works.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Chola bronzes were indeed made for ritual worship and are aesthetically remarkable, the text mentions that an alloy of *five* metals was *sometimes* used, not that it was a standard or defining characteristic of all Chola bronzes.  The primary alloy would have been bronze (copper and tin), with other metals potentially added for specific effects or in specific instances. The use of five metals is presented as an occasional practice, not a defining feature of the Chola style.  The question attempts to mislead by using a partially true statement (the use of multiple metals) and making it appear as a definitive characteristic of all Chola bronzes.


**2. With reference to the iconography in Indian bronze sculptures, consider the following statements:**

1.  The eight-armed Avalokiteshvara, depicted in a graceful tribhanga posture, exemplifies the male figures prevalent in the Vajrayana phase of Buddhism, a period marked by the growing popularity of Tara.
2.  The Ardhanarishvara murti, a single image ingeniously representing the union of Shiva and Parvati, is a notable example of Shaiva iconography, showcasing the manner in which the Panigrahana (marriage ceremony) is depicted.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage describes a four-armed (not eight-armed), Avalokiteshvara bronze sculpture as a good example of a male figure in the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, a period that saw the rise in popularity of Tara.  The description accurately reflects the stylistic and religious context of the sculpture.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ardhanarishvara murti does represent the union of Shiva and Parvati, the passage explicitly connects the Panigrahana (marriage ceremony) with the Kalyanasundara murti, a separate example of Shaiva iconography using two statuettes, not a single image.  The question wrongly attributes the Panigrahana depiction to the Ardhanarishvara, creating a plausible distractor based on related concepts.



**3. With reference to the techniques of bronze casting in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The cire-perdu or 'lost-wax' process, originating in the Indus Valley Civilization, was consistently used across all regions of India from the second century CE to the sixteenth century CE for creating bronze images of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain icons.
2.  The lost-wax process, still practiced by some tribal communities, involved the use of a wax model covered in a paste of clay, sand, and cow dung, into which molten metal, often scrap metal, was poured after firing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

1.  The Lakshmana temple at Khajuraho, built in 954 CE by the Chandela king Dhanga, is an example of the *phamsana* type of Nagara temple.
2.  The Deogarh temple, dating back to the early 6th century CE, showcases the *panchayatana* style, featuring a main shrine and four smaller subsidiary shrines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes the Lakshmana temple at Khajuraho as a *nagara* temple with a high platform and multiple towers rising in a curved pyramidal fashion. It does *not* identify it as a *phamsana* type.  The *phamsana* style is characterized by broader, shorter structures with roofs composed of several slabs rising to a single point, contrasting with the Lakshmana temple's description.  This highlights the need for precise understanding of architectural terminology within the context of Indian temple styles.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Akota hoard does represent Jain Tirthankaras, the text places its dating between the end of the 5th and the end of the 7th century CE, not the 2nd century CE.

2.  The Kailashnath temple at Ellora, carved out of a single rock, exemplifies the Dravida style of temple architecture, complete with a Nandi shrine and surrounding cloisters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although described as a distinct style, the text indicates that the Vesara style is considered by some scholars as a hybrid style, created through a selective mixing of Nagara and Dravida elements. The statement's assertion of complete separation from Nagara and Dravida styles is inaccurate.  This illustrates the complexity of categorizing architectural styles and the potential for stylistic blending.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text accurately describes the Kailashnath temple at Ellora as a monolithic Dravida-style structure, including features like a Nandi shrine and surrounding cloisters.

2. In the later phases (4th-6th centuries CE), Mathura sculptures transitioned to a more refined style, reducing massiveness and fleshiness, integrating drapery into the sculptural mass, and exhibiting a transparent quality in the robes of Buddha images.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the early characteristics of Mathura sculpture.  From the 1st century CE onward, the Mathura school gained prominence, initially representing Vaishnava and Shaiva deities primarily through their ayudhas (weapons). This approach emphasized symbolic representation. The sculptures of this period were characterized by boldness in carving, projecting volume, and a relaxed, fleshy depiction of human forms. The smiling faces and reduced heaviness in the sculptural volume reflect a specific aesthetic sensibility.

Statement 2 correctly outlines the evolution of Mathura sculpture in later phases.  From the 4th to 6th centuries CE, a noticeable stylistic shift occurred.  The sculptures became more refined, reducing the earlier emphasis on massiveness and fleshiness.  The drapery became integrated into the sculptural mass, creating a more unified and harmonious form.  The robes of Buddha images, in particular, started to exhibit a transparent quality, reflecting a greater focus on subtle detailing and the rendering of textures.  This stylistic change demonstrates a continuous evolution within the Mathura school, reflecting changing artistic preferences and techniques.  The comparison with the Sarnath style, which featured plain transparent drapery, further highlights the distinct characteristics of the Mathura school's evolving aesthetic.

They stand in contrast to Achaemenian pillars, which were constructed in sections.  A defining feature of Mauryan pillars is their capitals, which typically depict animals such as the bull, lion, and elephant.  These animal figures are shown standing on abacuses, which are often decorated with stylized lotuses.  The contrast between the rock-cut Mauryan pillars and the constructed Achaemenian pillars highlights the differing techniques and aesthetic preferences of these two civilizations.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Sarnath Lion Capital is indeed a renowned Mauryan sculptural achievement and serves as India's national emblem.  The capital originally consisted of a shaft, a lotus bell base, a drum with four animals arranged clockwise, four addorsed lions, and a crowning Dharamchakra (wheel). While the wheel is now broken, the remaining four lions on the circular abacus, with the four animals between the chakras, are a central part of the emblem.  The depiction of these elements symbolizes the Dhammachakrapravartana (the Buddha's first sermon), making it a potent symbol in Buddhist art and a significant historical artifact. The description of the lions' musculature and the detailed carving of the abacus highlight the technical skill and artistic mastery of the Mauryan sculptors.


Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to the specified format and criteria.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to bronze sculpture in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "lost-wax" process, known as cire-perdu, was a technique primarily used in South India during the Chola period for creating large-scale bronze sculptures of deities.
2.  While bronze casting was practiced across India from the second century CE to the sixteenth century, the Gupta and Vakataka periods (5th-7th centuries CE) are particularly noted for their refined and portable bronze Buddha images, often carried by monks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

1.  The Nagara style, prevalent in North India, is characterized by a stepped pyramid-shaped vimana, culminating in a small stupika or octagonal cupola, and typically enclosed within a compound wall with a gopuram gateway.
2.  The Dravida style, dominant in South India, features a curvilinear shikhara that curves inward sharply near the top, often preceded by a mandapa (hall) called a jagamohana in Odisha, and frequently incorporates extensive exterior carvings while keeping the interiors relatively bare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements incorrectly interchange characteristics of the Nagara and Dravida styles.  Statement 1 attributes the stepped pyramid vimana and gopuram to the Nagara style, which are actually hallmarks of the Dravida style. The Nagara style uses a curvilinear shikhara. Statement 2 incorrectly describes the Dravida style's shikhara as curvilinear and sharply inward-curving near the top, and attributes the jagamohana (found in Odisha temples, a sub-style of Nagara) to it.  The Dravida style uses a vimana, not a shikhara.  The description of extensive exterior carvings and bare interiors better fits the Odisha temples (a Nagara sub-style).

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The majority of Indus Valley pottery was wheel-made, not hand-made, reflecting advanced technological capabilities. While painted ware existed, plain pottery was more common, often in red clay with or without a slip (a coating). The description of decorations as primarily "elaborate painted decorations featuring geometric and floral motifs" is an overstatement; geometric and animal designs were more common than complex floral patterns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Polychrome pottery was rare, not prevalent.  While it did exist and featured red, black, and green (and less frequently white and yellow), it was typically found in smaller vessels rather than large storage jars. The statement misrepresents the frequency and scale of polychrome pottery within the Indus Valley Civilization's ceramic repertoire. The focus on large storage jars is also a misdirection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Chola bronze sculptures from Tamil Nadu (10th-12th centuries CE) are renowned for their depictions of Hindu deities, particularly Shiva and Vishnu, often in dynamic poses. The lost-wax casting technique reached its zenith during this period. The sculptures are characterized by a high level of anatomical realism and attention to detail in the rendering of musculature, drapery, and jewelry.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Nataraja, the iconic image of Shiva as the cosmic dancer, is a major and celebrated theme in Chola bronze sculpture.  Far from being uncommon, it represents a high point of artistic achievement and spiritual expression during the Chola period, demonstrating their mastery of form, movement, and symbolic representation. The statement wrongly minimizes the significance of Nataraja within the Chola bronze tradition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Indo-Islamic architecture did borrow some elements from pre-existing structures, it significantly shifted towards the arcuate system (using arches and vaults) for supporting domes and large spaces. The trabeated system (using horizontal beams and lintels) was largely superseded, though some elements might have been retained in hybrid forms.  The statement overemphasizes the continuity with earlier styles and underplays the innovative aspects of Indo-Islamic architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While arches, domes, and intricate jali work became prominent features of Indo-Islamic architecture,  elements like arches and domes existed in earlier Indian architecture, albeit in different forms and scales.  The statement inaccurately suggests complete absence of these elements in earlier traditions. The distinctive quality of Indo-Islamic architecture lies in its innovative combinations and adaptations of these features, not their complete novelty.  The level of intricacy in jali work did reach new heights, but the basic concept wasn't entirely new.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nagara style is indeed characterized by a curvilinear shikhara, amalaka, and kalasha, but it is predominantly found in North India, not South India.  The statement incorrectly locates the Nagara style geographically.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Dravida style does feature a stepped pyramid-like vimana and a gopuram, but it is primarily found in South India, not North India. The statement incorrectly locates the Dravida style geographically.  The two styles represent distinct regional traditions within Indian temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Mathura school sculptures during the Kushana period are actually known for their depiction of Buddha images with a more fleshy or robust build, not slender bodies.  The drapery, while sometimes appearing "transparent", often shows folds and details.  The ornamentation, particularly in the halo, can be quite elaborate. The statement misrepresents the stylistic characteristics of Kushana-period Mathura sculptures.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gandhara school, located in the northwestern region (present-day Pakistan), did indeed blend Greco-Roman influences with local traditions.  Its Buddha images are characterized by a more fleshy build compared to those of Mathura, wavy or curly hair, and a generally serene expression. The statement accurately captures the key features of the Gandhara style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lakshmana Temple is indeed dedicated to Vishnu and is built in the nagara style, but it is not a panchayatana temple with a single shikhara. It is a panchayatana-style temple with multiple shikharas, and the ornamentation is far from minimal; it is quite elaborate and extensive. The description of the temple as having a "single, tall, curvilinear shikhara" is a misrepresentation of its architectural features.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kandariya Mahadeo Temple is dedicated to Shiva and is a prime example of the nagara style with multiple, intricately carved shikharas arranged in a pyramidal fashion.  It is famously known for its extensive erotic sculptures, which are integrated into the overall decorative scheme of the temple.  The statement accurately describes the architectural style and prominent sculptural features of the Kandariya Mahadeo Temple.

1.  Pallava sculptures are primarily known for their depiction of Hindu deities in a highly stylized manner, characterized by elongated proportions and minimal anatomical detail.
2.  The Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram, a Pallava-era monument, is an example of rock-cut architecture, showcasing a combination of Dravidian and Nagara architectural styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Pallava sculptures do depict Hindu deities, the description of their style as "highly stylized manner, characterized by elongated proportions and minimal anatomical detail" is an oversimplification.  Pallava sculpture shows a range of styles, and while some examples may feature stylized elements, many others demonstrate a greater degree of anatomical realism and attention to detail.  The statement misrepresents the diversity of stylistic approaches within Pallava sculpture.

Statement 2 is correct. The Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram is a significant example of Pallava rock-cut architecture.  It exhibits a blend of architectural elements, incorporating features of both Dravidian and Nagara styles, demonstrating the Pallava's ability to synthesize different artistic traditions.  The statement accurately identifies the architectural style and the fusion of different regional influences.

1.  The Dilwara Temples at Mount Abu are renowned for their intricate marble carvings, featuring deep undercutting that creates a lace-like appearance, and are primarily associated with the Vaishnava sect of Hinduism.
2.  The Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola is a monolithic free-standing sculpture, representing the last Tirthankara of Jainism, and was commissioned by a Chola king.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dilwara Temples at Mount Abu are indeed known for their exquisite marble carvings with deep undercutting, creating a lace-like effect. However, they are associated with Jainism, not the Vaishnava sect of Hinduism.  The statement incorrectly attributes the temples to a different religious tradition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola is indeed a monolithic free-standing sculpture representing Bahubali, a significant figure in Jainism (not the last Tirthankara). However, it was commissioned by the Ganga dynasty's general and minister, Chamundaraya, not a Chola king.  The statement incorrectly identifies the commissioning dynasty.


**1. With reference to the Pala style of sculpture in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pala style, flourishing between the 9th and 11th centuries, is named after the ruling Pala dynasty and is characterized by tall, curving shikharas.
2.  Temples exhibiting the Pala style are predominantly Buddhist, reflecting the Palas' patronage of Buddhist monastic sites.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Pala style of sculpture, prevalent in Bengal (including Bangladesh) and Bihar between the 9th and 11th centuries, is indeed named after the Pala dynasty.  A key characteristic of this style is the tall, curving shikhara, as exemplified by the Siddheshvara Mahadeva temple in Barakar.  This architectural feature demonstrates a clear continuity with contemporaneous Odisha temple styles. The evolution of the shikhara from a basic form to a loftier one over centuries is also a significant aspect of Pala architectural development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Palas were indeed known for their patronage of numerous Buddhist monastic sites, the temples of the Pala period are not exclusively Buddhist.  The text explicitly mentions that temples from this region express the local Vanga style, encompassing both Hindu and Buddhist traditions. The existence of Hindu temples alongside Buddhist sites indicates a syncretic religious landscape where both faiths coexisted and influenced each other's artistic expression.  The focus on Buddhist monastic sites shouldn't be interpreted to mean an exclusive focus on Buddhist temple architecture within the broader Pala style.  The stylistic elements of the Pala style were applied to temples of diverse religious affiliations.

1. Odisha temples, primarily located in the ancient Kalinga region, are characterized by a deul (shikhara) that is predominantly vertical until the top, where it sharply curves inwards.
2. The Jagannath temple at Puri, a prominent example of Odisha temple architecture, features a square ground plan that transitions to a circular shape in the upper reaches of its superstructure, resulting in a nearly cylindrical spire.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key features of Odisha temple architecture.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the distinctive characteristic of the deul (shikhara) in Odisha temples.  The near-vertical rise followed by a sudden inward curve is a defining feature that sets Odisha temple architecture apart from other styles in India. This unique design element is a crucial aspect of Odisha's distinct sub-style within the Nagara order.

Statement 2 is also accurate. The Jagannath temple at Puri serves as a prime example of the typical Odisha temple ground plan.  The transition from a square base to a circular shape in the upper parts of the superstructure, resulting in an almost cylindrical spire, is a key feature mentioned in the text. This architectural progression contributes to the overall visual impact of the temple and highlights the sophisticated design principles employed in Odisha temple building. The consistent use of a square ground plan, which transforms into a circular crown, is a significant stylistic trait of the region.

1. Hoysala temples, primarily located in Karnataka, are characterized by simple, square ground plans with minimal projecting angles.
2. The Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid, built in dark schist stone, exemplifies the Hoysala style with its highly intricate carvings and a unique stellate plan.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Hoysala temple architecture is renowned for its complexity and intricate designs.  Rather than simple, square plans, Hoysala temples are characterized by a stellate plan, formed by numerous projecting angles that emanate from a central square. This complex design creates a star-like shape, a defining feature of the Hoysala style. The intricate carvings further enhance this complexity, making the temples visually striking.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid perfectly illustrates the characteristic features of Hoysala temple architecture.  Built from dark schist stone, the temple showcases the highly original star-like ground plan and an abundance of decorative carvings. The intricate detail of the sculptures, especially evident in the jewellery of the deities, is a hallmark of the Hoysala style.  The fact that the temple’s towers have long since fallen does not diminish its significance as an exemplar of the style, as its detailed miniature versions flanking the entrances still provide insight into the temple's original grandeur.


**4. With reference to the Vijayanagara style of painting, consider the following statements:**

1. Vijayanagara paintings, primarily found in temples, are characterized by figures depicted in three-dimensional forms against richly detailed backgrounds.
2. The paintings at Lepakshi exemplify the Vijayanagara style, featuring figures shown in profile with large frontal eyes and narrow waists, set against a flat background.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Vijayanagara paintings, while impressive, are characterized by a distinctly two-dimensional representation of figures and objects against a flat background. This stylistic convention contrasts with the three-dimensional perspective found in other painting traditions. The use of rectilinear compartments to organize the compositions is another salient feature.  The emphasis is on line and composition rather than depth or perspective.

Statement 2 is correct. The paintings of Lepakshi serve as a prime example of the Vijayanagara style.  The figures, often shown in profile, possess large frontal eyes and narrow waists, conforming to the stylistic conventions of the period.  The flat background is also a key element, highlighting the two-dimensional nature of the artwork. These stylistic choices reflect a conscious continuation of established artistic traditions in South India.  The profile view of the faces and the two-dimensional representation of figures are defining elements of the style.

1.  Ajanta caves, known for their extensive murals, include single, double, and triple-storied caves with massive pillars.  The shrine Buddha images are typically large and flanked by Padmapani and Vajrapani.  Cave No. 12, a triple-storied excavation, features a wide array of Buddhist deities.
2.  Ellora caves, exhibiting a diversity of religious styles, include Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain caves.  The Hindu caves (Cave Nos. 13-28) feature monumental sculptures with deep recession in the picture space, depicting various forms of Shiva and Vishnu. The Kailashnath temple (Cave 16) is a notable monolithic rock-cut structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements provide accurate information on rock-cut cave architecture at Ajanta and Ellora. Statement 1 correctly describes Ajanta caves, highlighting their size variations (single, double, and triple-storied), massive pillars, large shrine Buddha images flanked by Padmapani and Vajrapani, and the diverse deities in Cave No. 12.  Statement 2 accurately describes Ellora caves, emphasizing the presence of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain caves. The description of the monumental sculptures in Hindu caves (13-28), the use of deep recession in the picture space, and the depiction of Shiva and Vishnu forms are accurate. The mention of the Kailashnath temple (Cave 16) as a monolithic structure further validates the statement. The information presented is accurate and does not contain misleading details.



**1. With reference to the characteristics of Hoysala temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. Hoysala temples are exclusively built using granite, contributing to their intricate carvings and durability.
2.  The stellate plan, a unique feature of Hoysala temples, results from numerous projecting angles emerging from a central square structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Hoysala temples are renowned for their intricate carvings, they were primarily constructed using soapstone (a relatively soft stone), not granite.  The use of soapstone allowed for the detailed and delicate sculptures that are characteristic of Hoysala architecture.  Granite, being harder, would have presented significant challenges to achieving such intricate detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The stellate plan is a defining characteristic of Hoysala temples.  This unique architectural design emerges from the complex interplay of numerous projecting angles extending from an initial square or rectangular core. This creates a star-like ground plan, visually distinct from other temple styles of the medieval period. The complexity of the design, combined with the use of soapstone, enabled the creation of highly ornamented surfaces. The intricate carvings of animals and deities are a testament to the artistic skill and the material's malleability.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the materials used and the unique architectural features of Hoysala temples.


**2. With reference to the bronze sculptures of the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "lost-wax" casting technique, employed since the Indus Valley Civilization, was primarily used for creating utilitarian objects like cooking utensils during the medieval period.
2.  The Chola bronze sculptures are characterized by their dynamic poses, often depicting deities in action, contrasting with the more serene figures of the Gupta period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the "lost-wax" technique did originate in the Indus Valley Civilization and was continued in the medieval period, its use extended far beyond utilitarian objects.  Medieval India saw a flourishing of bronze sculptures of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain deities, created using this technique. These sculptures were often intended for ritual worship and were highly valued for their aesthetic appeal. The statement incorrectly limits the application of this technique.

Statement 2 is correct.  Chola bronze sculptures are indeed known for their dynamic and expressive poses, often capturing deities in action-filled moments. This contrasts with the more serene and static postures frequently seen in Gupta period bronzes. The Chola style exhibits a greater sense of movement and energy, showcasing a more active and engaging depiction of religious figures. The difference reflects evolving artistic sensibilities and religious emphasis between the two periods.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccurate depiction of the "lost-wax" technique's use and the stylistic differences between Chola and Gupta bronze sculptures.



**3. With reference to the architectural styles prevalent in different regions of India during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pala style of Bengal, characterized by tall, curving shikharas, shows a significant influence from the Dravidian temple architecture of South India.
2.  The Odisha temple architecture, with its distinct deul (shikhara) and jagamohana (mandapa), represents a unique sub-style within the Nagara order.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Pala style of Bengal, while possessing tall curving shikharas, primarily draws its inspiration from the Nagara order of North India, not the Dravidian style of the South.  While regional variations exist, the overall structural principles and stylistic elements align more closely with the Nagara tradition. Influences from other regional styles might be present, but the primary lineage remains within the Nagara architectural framework.

Statement 2 is correct.  Odisha's temple architecture, with its distinctive deul (shikhara) and jagamohana (mandapa), is indeed a unique sub-style within the broader Nagara order.  The verticality of the deul, culminating in a sharp inward curve at the apex, distinguishes it from other Nagara variations. The jagamohana, the assembly hall, is another important component of the Odisha temple complex.  This distinct combination of features creates a recognizable and regionally specific architectural identity within the Nagara classification.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore inaccurate due to the mischaracterization of the Pala style's origins and the unique status of Odisha's temple architecture within the Nagara order.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the artistic expressions of the Mauryan period:**

1. The Didarganj Yakshini, a life-size sandstone sculpture, exemplifies the Mauryan period’s preference for abstract and stylized representations of the human form.
2. The Sarnath Lion Capital, a national emblem of India, features four lions seated back-to-back on a circular abacus adorned with a wheel motif symbolizing the Dhammachakrapravartana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Didarganj Yakshini, while a remarkable example of Mauryan sculpture, is far from abstract or stylized. It is a highly realistic and life-size representation of a female figure, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of human anatomy and a keen attention to detail in the rendering of the body's musculature and drapery. The polished surface further enhances the sculpture's realism.  The statement misrepresents the stylistic approach of the sculpture.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sarnath Lion Capital accurately reflects the description provided.  The four lions, seated back-to-back, atop a circular abacus (decorated with a wheel motif representing the Dhammachakrapravartana - the first sermon of Buddha) are iconic elements of Mauryan art.  The wheel symbolism is deeply significant within Buddhist art and the overall composition of the capital showcases the Mauryan mastery of sculptural techniques.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect due to the mischaracterization of the Didarganj Yakshini and the accurate description of the Sarnath Lion Capital.


**5. With reference to the Indo-Islamic architecture of Mandu, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama Masjid at Mandu exhibits a distinct regional style significantly deviating from the architectural trends of Imperial Delhi.
2.  The Hoshang Shah's tomb at Mandu, while demonstrating the robustness typical of Afghan architecture, incorporates elements like lattice work and toranas, lending it a softer aesthetic.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pathan architecture of Mandu, while possessing its own unique characteristics, is considered relatively close to the architectural styles of Imperial Delhi.  While there might be subtle regional variations, the fundamental principles and design elements show a strong connection to the broader Indo-Islamic architectural tradition prevalent in Delhi.  The statement overstates the degree of divergence from Delhi's architectural trends.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hoshang Shah's tomb aptly demonstrates the blend described. It showcases the inherent robustness often associated with Afghan architecture. However, it also integrates elements such as intricate lattice work (jali), carved brackets, and toranas (ornate gateways), which contribute to a softer and more refined aesthetic. This combination of robust structural elements with delicate decorative features creates a unique visual appeal that balances strength and elegance.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because of the inaccurate assessment of the Jama Masjid's stylistic distinctiveness and the correct description of the Hoshang Shah's tomb's architectural features.


**6. With reference to the features of Nagara temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Latina or Rekha-Prasada type of shikhara is characterized by a broad and short structure with a gently sloping roof composed of several slabs rising to a single point.
2. The Phamsana type of Nagara temple structure is typically taller and more sharply curving than the Latina type, often used for the main garbhagriha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The description of the Latina or Rekha-Prasada shikhara is reversed. The Latina type is characterized by a tall, sharply rising tower with a curvilinear profile, unlike the description given which accurately describes the Phamsana type. The Latina shikhara is not broad and short but rather tall and vertically emphasized.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. It incorrectly states that the Phamsana type is taller and more sharply curving than the Latina type.  In reality, the Phamsana type is broader and shorter with a gently sloping roof, while the Latina type is characterized by its tall, curvilinear form. The statement reverses the characteristics of both types.

Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because both statements misrepresent the key features of the Latina and Phamsana types of Nagara temple architecture.


**7. With reference to the art of the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley pottery is primarily characterized by elaborate polychrome designs, showcasing a wide range of colors and intricate patterns.
2.  The “Dancing Girl” bronze sculpture from Mohenjodaro, with its lifelike depiction and detailed ornamentation, showcases the high level of artistic skill in metal casting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Indus Valley pottery exhibits a variety of styles, including some painted ware, it is inaccurate to describe it as primarily characterized by elaborate polychrome designs.  Plain pottery, often red in color, was far more common than the polychrome variety. The polychrome pottery, though aesthetically significant, was relatively rare. The statement exaggerates the prevalence of polychrome pottery.

Statement 2 is correct. The “Dancing Girl” bronze sculpture from Mohenjodaro is a prime example of the sophisticated metal casting techniques of the Indus Valley Civilization.  Its lifelike representation, detailed ornamentation (bangles, necklace), and expressive pose demonstrate a high level of artistic skill and technical proficiency in metalworking. The sculpture is a testament to the advanced metallurgical and artistic capabilities of the civilization.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because of the inaccurate assessment of the dominant pottery style and the accurate description of the “Dancing Girl” sculpture.


**8.  With reference to the prehistoric rock paintings of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The rock paintings of Bhimbetka, Madhya Pradesh, primarily depict scenes of hunting and warfare, reflecting the violent and competitive nature of prehistoric society.
2.  The rock shelters at Lakhudiyar, Uttarakhand, contain paintings categorized into three styles based on color: black, red ochre, and white, with the black paintings being the earliest.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While hunting scenes are a prominent feature of Bhimbetka's rock paintings, to characterize them as primarily depicting violence and warfare is an oversimplification. The paintings encompass a much broader range of themes, including scenes of daily life, dance, music, and even what might be interpreted as religious or ritualistic activities.  The statement presents a biased and incomplete view of the artistic expression.

Statement 2 is correct.  The rock shelters at Lakhudiyar indeed contain paintings categorized into three distinct color styles: black, red ochre, and white.  The chronological sequence, based on superposition, suggests that the black paintings are the oldest, followed by red ochre and then white. This layered approach to the paintings provides valuable insights into the evolution of artistic styles and techniques over time.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of the thematic range in Bhimbetka's rock art and the accurate description of the stylistic layering observed at Lakhudiyar.


**9. With reference to the features of Dravidian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The vimana, the main temple tower in Dravidian architecture, is characterized by a curvilinear profile, similar to the shikhara of Nagara temples, rising to a pointed apex.
2. Gopurams, the monumental gateway towers, are a unique feature of Dravidian temples, often elaborately sculpted and significantly taller than the main temple structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The vimana in Dravidian architecture is characterized by a pyramidal or stepped profile, distinctly different from the curvilinear shikhara of Nagara temples. The Dravidian vimana rises in a series of receding tiers, creating a geometric and visually imposing structure. The statement incorrectly attributes a Nagara characteristic to Dravidian architecture.

Statement 2 is correct. Gopurams are indeed a distinctive and defining feature of Dravidian temples. These monumental gateway towers are often elaborately sculpted and are frequently taller than the main temple structure itself. They serve as prominent visual markers of the temple complex and are often richly decorated with intricate carvings of deities, mythical figures, and other decorative motifs.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the mischaracterization of the vimana's profile and the accurate description of the significance of gopurams in Dravidian temple architecture.


**1. With reference to the architectural features of the Jama Masjid in Mandu, consider the following statements:**

1.  The mosque's main entrance is a monumental gateway topped with a large, elaborate dome, leading into a spacious courtyard.
2.  The Qibla Liwan features a mimbar supported by intricately carved brackets and a mihrab adorned with a lotus bud fringe.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jama Masjid in Mandu does indeed have a monumental gateway as its main entrance, the description states that the dome atop the gateway is described as "squat," implying it's relatively small and not elaborate compared to other architectural elements.  The emphasis is on the open courtyard,  flanked by columned cloisters and topped with smaller domes. The grand scale is in the overall design and the courtyard, not just the entrance dome.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the mimbar in the Qibla Liwan being supported by carved brackets and the mihrab having a lotus bud fringe. These details accurately reflect the mosque's architectural ornamentation.

Option (b) is the correct answer because only statement 2 aligns precisely with the textual description of the Jama Masjid in Mandu. The other options misinterpret or overstate certain aspects of the mosque's design.


**2. With reference to the Taj Mahal's architectural design and construction, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Taj Mahal's main structure is a perfect octagon, resting on a square plinth, which is further embellished with chamfers creating eight sides.
2.  The construction of the Taj Mahal involved approximately 20,000 specialized workers over a period of 20 years, beginning in 1632.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage describes the tomb structure as a square with chamfers, effectively resulting in an eight-sided polygon.  This is a key feature of the Taj Mahal's design, contributing to its visual appeal and symmetry. The description of the structure resting on a square plinth is also accurate.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explicitly states that the construction of the Taj Mahal, starting in 1632, took roughly twenty years and involved approximately 20,000 specialized workers. This reflects the monumental scale of the project and the skilled workforce required.

Option (c) is correct as both statements accurately reflect the architectural and construction details of the Taj Mahal based on the provided text.

2.  The Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan, represents the culmination of the evolutionary architectural process in medieval India, seamlessly blending Indo-Islamic and other styles.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the Pathan architecture of Mandu is considered "too close to the structures of Imperial Delhi," implying a lack of significant deviation from the broader Indo-Islamic style prevalent in Delhi.  The text mentions surface embellishments but doesn't suggest a unique, independent style.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage describes the Taj Mahal as the "apogee of the evolutionary architectural process in medieval India," highlighting its significance in the development of Indo-Islamic architecture.  While the text doesn't explicitly state a blending of other styles, the description of its sublimity and unique features implicitly suggests a synthesis of various influences.

Option (b) is correct because only statement 2 accurately reflects the passage's assessment of the Taj Mahal's place within the evolution of Indo-Islamic architecture.  Statement 1 contradicts the text's description of Mandu's architectural style.


**4. With reference to the Gol Gumbad, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gol Gumbad's construction began in 1626 and lasted until 1656, employing a large workforce of specialized artisans.
2.  Despite being unfinished, the Gol Gumbad showcases grandeur and majesty, symbolizing the heights of Indo-Islamic architectural achievement.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text indicates that the Gol Gumbad's construction spanned from 1626 to 1656 and that 20,000 specialized workers were employed.  The duration and scale of the workforce accurately reflect the monumental nature of the project.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage explicitly mentions that despite being unfinished, the Gol Gumbad "symbolizes the grandeur and majesty of Indo-Islamic architecture." This highlights the structure's significance even in its incomplete state.

Therefore, option (c) is correct, as both statements are supported by the provided text.


**5. With reference to the  Jain temples at Mount Abu, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jain temples at Mount Abu, constructed by Vimal Shah, are known for their ornate exteriors and relatively simple marble interiors.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage specifically notes that the Jain temples at Mount Abu are notable for their "simplistic exterior in contrast with the exuberant marble interiors." This directly contradicts the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the temples are famous for their "unique patterns on every ceiling, and the graceful bracket figures along the domed ceilings." This aligns perfectly with the statement.

Option (b) is the correct answer as it accurately reflects the description of the Jain temples at Mount Abu in the provided text.


**6. With reference to the Ravana shaking Mount Kailasha sculpture at Ellora, consider the following statements:**

1.  This colossal sculpture, located on the right wall of the Kailashnath temple (Cave No. 16), is dated to the eighth century CE.
2.  The composition features a multi-faced, multi-armed Ravana shaking the mountain, with the upper tiers depicting Shiva, Parvati, and celestial beings witnessing the event.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage correctly states that the sculpture is located on the *left* wall of the Kailashnath temple (Cave No. 16) and that it is dated to the eighth century CE.  The incorrect placement of the sculpture in statement 1 makes it false.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the composition of the sculpture, detailing Ravana's depiction and the presence of Shiva, Parvati, and celestial beings in the upper tiers.

Therefore, (b) is the correct answer, as only statement 2 aligns with the provided description.


**7. With reference to the architectural styles of Odisha temples, consider the following statements:**

1. The main architectural features of Odisha temples are classified into three orders: rekhapida, pidhadeul, and khakra, with most major temple sites located in ancient Kalinga (modern Puri District).
2.  Odisha temples typically feature a vertical shikhara (called deul) that curves sharply inwards near the top, preceded by a mandapa (called jagamohana), and often include boundary walls.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

The arrangement is symbolic and reflects the cosmological beliefs of the time.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Khajuraho temples, located in Madhya Pradesh, are world-famous for their intricate sculptures, which include depictions of erotic scenes alongside religious figures. These temples are predominantly built from sandstone and exemplify the mature nagara architectural style.  Key features include tall, curvilinear shikharas (towers) that rise in a graceful curve, projecting balconies and verandas that add to their visual complexity, and a high level of decorative detail in the carvings. The inclusion of erotic sculptures alongside religious imagery reflects the broader cosmological worldview of the time, where the sensual and spiritual are not mutually exclusive.


**5. With reference to the artistic traditions of South India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vijayanagara paintings, characterized by profile faces, two-dimensional figures, and rectilinear compositions, represent a continuation of earlier stylistic conventions but also show some regional variations.
2.  Kerala murals, developed between the 16th and 18th centuries, uniquely blended elements from Nayaka and Vijayanagara styles with local traditions like Kathakali, resulting in three-dimensional figures and vibrant colors.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe distinct artistic traditions in South India. Statement 1 correctly characterizes Vijayanagara paintings.  The Vijayanagara style, flourishing in the late 14th to 16th centuries, built upon existing artistic conventions.  The paintings characteristically feature profile faces, figures rendered in a largely two-dimensional manner, and compositions organized within clearly defined rectilinear compartments.  While these stylistic elements connect the Vijayanagara style to its predecessors, regional variations and adaptations can also be observed across different centers and periods within the Vijayanagara kingdom.

Statement 2 is also correct. The mural painting tradition of Kerala, which flourished between the 16th and 18th centuries, demonstrates a unique synthesis of influences. The Kerala style selectively incorporated stylistic features from the earlier Nayaka and Vijayanagara schools but also drew significantly from local traditions like Kathakali dance-drama. This resulted in a distinct artistic language characterized by three-dimensional figures, vibrant and luminous colors, and a thematic focus on stories and episodes from Hindu mythology popular in Kerala.  The integration of local traditions into a broader stylistic context showcases the dynamic interplay between regional and broader artistic developments.


**6. With reference to the Indo-Islamic architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jama Masjids, large mosques built to accommodate numerous worshippers, typically featured an open courtyard surrounded by cloisters and a Qibla Liwan housing the mihrab and mimbar.
2.  The Taj Mahal, a mausoleum built by Shah Jahan, exemplifies the culmination of architectural evolution in medieval India, showcasing perfect proportions, symmetry, and a harmonious blend of white marble and red sandstone.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe significant aspects of Indo-Islamic architecture in India. Statement 1 correctly outlines the typical features of Jama Masjids. These large congregational mosques, designed to accommodate a large number of worshippers for Friday prayers, usually consisted of a spacious open courtyard (sahn) surrounded on three sides by covered cloisters (liwan). The western wall of the courtyard housed the Qibla Liwan, which contained the mihrab (a niche indicating the direction of Mecca) and the mimbar (the pulpit from which the Imam delivered sermons). This standardized layout reflects the functional and ritual needs of Islamic worship.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Taj Mahal, constructed in Agra by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, is widely regarded as a pinnacle of architectural achievement in medieval India.  Its design showcases remarkable attention to detail, perfect proportions, and a striking symmetry.  The use of white marble, contrasted with the red sandstone of surrounding structures, creates a visually stunning effect. The harmonious integration of the building within its carefully planned garden setting further enhances its aesthetic impact.  The Taj Mahal's enduring beauty and its status as an iconic monument reflect the high point of architectural innovation and artistic sensibility in the period.


**7. With reference to the sculptural traditions of the Post-Mauryan period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mathura emerged as a major center for sculptural production, creating images of various religious figures including Buddha, Yakshas, and deities from both Shaiva and Vaishnava traditions, exhibiting a gradual evolution in style from robust forms to more refined and slender figures.
2.  Amaravati, in Andhra Pradesh, developed a distinct sculptural style characterized by dynamic movement, slender figures with three bends (tribhanga), and a complex use of overlapping to create three-dimensional space in its relief sculptures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of Post-Mauryan sculptural traditions. Statement 1 correctly describes the evolution of sculptural styles in Mathura. Mathura, in Uttar Pradesh, became a significant center for art production during the Post-Mauryan period and beyond.  Sculptors in Mathura produced a wide range of images, encompassing various religious traditions, including Buddhism, Shaivism, and Vaishnavism. The style evolved over time, transitioning from earlier, more robust and fleshy figures to later, more refined and slender representations. This evolution reflects changing aesthetic preferences and artistic innovations within the region.

Statement 2 is also correct. Amaravati, in Andhra Pradesh, developed a unique and highly expressive sculptural style. The sculptures at Amaravati, primarily associated with Buddhist stupas, are characterized by a strong sense of dynamism and movement. The figures are typically slender, often exhibiting the tribhanga posture (three bends in the body), and the artists employed a sophisticated technique of overlapping forms to create the illusion of depth and three-dimensionality within the relatively shallow relief sculptures. The expressive quality and technical skill exhibited in Amaravati sculptures set it apart as a distinct regional style.


**8. With reference to the early medieval temples of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The early temples of Madhya Pradesh, such as those at Udaigiri and Sanchi, were relatively modest structures with a simple square porch-like mandapa and a small garbhagriha, indicating a continuity of architectural forms between Buddhist and Brahmanical traditions.
2.  The Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho, built in the 10th century, represents a mature Nagara style with a tall, curvilinear shikhara, multiple smaller shrines, projecting balconies, and extensive carvings including erotic sculptures.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the characteristics of early medieval temples in India. Statement 1 correctly describes the early temples of Madhya Pradesh.  The early temples found in Madhya Pradesh, such as those at Udaigiri and Sanchi, are notable for their relatively modest scale and simple architectural plans.  These temples generally consisted of a small, square garbhagriha (sanctum) preceded by a simple mandapa (porch or hall). The presence of such structures at both Buddhist (Sanchi) and Brahmanical (Udaigiri) sites highlights a degree of architectural continuity and shared building traditions across different religious contexts.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho, built in the 10th century, is a prime example of the mature Nagara style of temple architecture. It showcases a tall, curvilinear shikhara (tower), a characteristic feature of the Nagara style.  The temple also features multiple smaller shrines arranged around the main structure, projecting balconies and verandas, and extensive carvings that include both religious and erotic imagery. The presence of erotic sculptures, along with religious figures, reflects the complex religious and cultural beliefs of the time, where the sensual and spiritual were not seen as mutually exclusive.  The temple's intricate carvings and overall design demonstrate a high level of artistic skill and architectural sophistication.


**1. With reference to the Pala style of sculpture in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pala style, flourishing between the 9th and 11th centuries, is named after the Sena dynasty.
2.  Temples from this period often exhibit the local Vanga style, incorporating features like a tall, curving shikhara.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pala style is actually named after the Pala dynasty, not the Sena dynasty. The Sena style followed the Pala style, emerging in the mid-11th to mid-13th centuries.  The question attempts to confuse the examinee by interchanging the dynasties associated with the art styles.  The Pala dynasty was known for its patronage of Buddhist monastic sites, but their temple architecture also reflected local aesthetics.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vanga style, a regional style of Bengal, is indeed a characteristic feature of Pala period temples. The description of the tall, curving shikhara crowned by a large amalaka, as seen in the Siddheshvara Mahadeva temple, is a key element of this style, highlighting the integration of local traditions with broader architectural trends.  The option provides a specific example to substantiate the claim, enhancing its credibility.


**2. With reference to the architectural features of Odisha temples, consider the following statements:**

1. Odisha temples are primarily classified into three orders: rekhapida, pidhadeul, and khakra, with most major sites located in ancient Kalinga.
2.  The shikhara, known as the deul, in Odisha temples, is characterized by a gradual, gentle curve from base to apex.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The three orders—rekhapida, pidhadeul, and khakra—are indeed the main classification for Odisha temples. The concentration of major temple sites in ancient Kalinga (modern Puri district, including Bhubaneswar, Puri, and Konark) is a well-established fact.  This statement is straightforward and directly verifiable from historical and architectural records.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The deul, the Odisha shikhara, is NOT characterized by a gradual curve. It is known for its verticality until the very top where it suddenly curves inwards sharply. The question attempts to mislead by providing an almost correct description of a different architectural style. This subtle inaccuracy makes it a challenging distractor for candidates with superficial knowledge.


**3. With reference to the architectural styles of Assam, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom style, prevalent in and around Guwahati, is a blend of the Pala style of Bengal and influences from the Tai people of Upper Burma.
2.  Sixth-century sculpted door frames from DaParvatia near Tezpur show a continuation of the post-Gupta style into the 12th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ahom architectural style of Assam is accurately described as a fusion of the Pala style from Bengal and influences introduced by the Tai migration from Upper Burma. This statement accurately reflects the historical and cultural processes that shaped the unique aesthetic of Ahom architecture. The question avoids ambiguity by clearly specifying the geographical location and time period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the sixth-century sculptures from DaParvatia near Tezpur do showcase the influence of the Gupta idiom, the post-Gupta style in Assam did not extend into the 12th century. The statement gives an incorrect time period, making it a misleading distractor. The distinct regional style of Assam primarily developed from the 12th to 14th centuries.


**4. With reference to the bronze casting techniques in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The "lost-wax" process, also known as cire-perdu, was discovered during the Indus Valley Civilization and is still used by tribal communities.
2.  Chola bronzes, renowned for their exquisite beauty, were primarily produced in the 8th and 9th centuries CE.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "lost-wax" or cire-perdu technique is indeed traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization and its continued use by contemporary tribal communities highlights its enduring significance in Indian art history. The statement correctly identifies both the antiquity and the continuity of this technique.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Chola bronzes are highly regarded, their peak period of production was the 10th to 12th centuries CE, not the 8th and 9th centuries. The statement provides incorrect time period, functioning as a plausible distractor.  The Pallava period (8th-9th centuries) also produced bronze sculptures but they are distinct stylistically from Chola bronzes.


**5. With reference to the features of the Khajuraho temples, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lakshmana Temple, dedicated to Vishnu, features a panchayatana style of architecture with a single, tall shikhara.
2.  The temples are renowned for their extensive erotic sculptures, which are integrated into the larger cosmic worldview.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho, while a nagara-style temple built on a high platform and featuring multiple smaller shrines, does *not* follow the panchayatana style. The panchayatana style has a central shrine surrounded by four smaller shrines, a feature not present in the Lakshmana temple's design. This statement plays on the common knowledge of temple architectural styles but introduces a specific inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Khajuraho temples are indeed famous for their extensive erotic sculptures. These sculptures are not merely decorative but are integrated into a larger cosmic and philosophical context, representing the acceptance of human experience in its entirety within the spiritual realm. This statement is a well-known fact about Khajuraho art.


**6.  With reference to the architectural features of the Taj Mahal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Taj Mahal complex is laid out in a Charbagh style garden, with the mausoleum situated centrally within the layout.
2. The main structure of the Taj Mahal is a square with chamfers creating eight sides, topped with a dome and four smaller cupolas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Taj Mahal is indeed situated within a Charbagh garden, the mausoleum is NOT centrally located. It is positioned at the northern end to take advantage of the river Yamuna's bank. The question cleverly uses a well-known fact (Charbagh design) to create a misleading statement about the mausoleum's placement.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the Taj Mahal's main structure as a square with chamfered sides creating an octagonal form, topped by a dome and four smaller cupolas, is accurate. This statement provides a precise and detailed description of the architectural design.


**7. With reference to the Indo-Islamic architecture of Mandu, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama Masjid at Mandu exhibits a distinct regional style, significantly deviating from the architectural traditions of Imperial Delhi.
2.  The architecture of Mandu is characterized by robust, austere features, combined with surface embellishments like jalis and carved brackets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement about Mandu architecture significantly deviating from Imperial Delhi's style is inaccurate. While Mandu architecture does possess its own characteristics, it is generally considered quite close to the styles seen in Imperial Delhi. The statement creates a false contrast to test the examinee’s understanding of regional variations within Indo-Islamic architecture.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of Mandu's architecture as robust and austere, yet incorporating decorative elements like jalis and carved brackets, is accurate. This statement captures the essential features of the Mandu architectural style, balancing its simplicity with its decorative aspects.  This accurate description contrasts with the inaccurate first statement.


**8. With reference to the  artistic traditions of South India during the medieval period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola period (10th-12th centuries CE) witnessed the production of some of the most exquisite bronze sculptures in South India, particularly in Kumbakonam.
2.  The Vijayanagara period (16th century CE) is marked by a significant decline in bronze sculpture production, with a focus shifting towards stone sculpture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chola period is indeed renowned for its exceptional bronze sculptures, with Kumbakonam being a significant center of production.  This statement is a widely accepted fact in art history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara period did *not* witness a decline in bronze sculpture. While it did produce other forms of art, bronze casting continued, even experimenting with portrait sculptures, as evidenced by the life-size statues of Krishnadevaraya and his queens. The statement is a misleading distractor, falsely suggesting a cessation of a particular art form.


**9. With reference to the Mauryan period art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mauryan pillars are rock-cut, showcasing advanced carving techniques, unlike the constructed Achaemenian pillars.
2.  The Sarnath Lion Capital, featuring four addorsed lions on a circular abacus, is a fine example of Mauryan sculptural tradition and is currently housed in the Patna Museum.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mauryan pillars are indeed rock-cut, demonstrating the mastery of carving techniques in that period. This is in contrast to the Achaemenian pillars, which were constructed from assembled pieces.  This statement highlights a key difference in techniques.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sarnath Lion Capital is indeed a remarkable example of Mauryan sculpture, it is *not* housed in the Patna Museum. It is located in the Archaeological Museum at Sarnath.  The question attempts to mislead by incorrectly specifying the location of an important artifact.


**10. With reference to the  post-Mauryan sculptural traditions of Mathura, consider the following statements:**

1. Early Mathura sculptures from the 2nd century CE are characterized by a sensual, rotund style, while later sculptures (4th-6th centuries) show a reduction in fleshiness and a greater integration of drapery with the sculptural mass.
2.  The Mathura school maintained a consistent style throughout its history, unlike the Sarnath school, which developed a distinctive style with plain, transparent drapery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The evolution of the Mathura sculptural style accurately reflects a shift from a more sensual, rotund style in the early centuries CE to a leaner, more integrated style in the later centuries.  This statement correctly identifies a stylistic development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement is incorrect because it implies that Mathura school maintained a consistent style. In reality, the Mathura school did experience stylistic changes over time, notably a shift towards a more refined and less fleshy style in later periods. The Sarnath school did develop its own distinctive style, but the statement incorrectly presents this as a contrast to a static Mathura style.  The statement is designed to test precise knowledge of stylistic changes within regional schools.


**1. With reference to Indo-Islamic architecture in Mandu, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama Masjid in Mandu, while large-scale, exhibits a Pathan architectural style closely resembling structures in Imperial Delhi, thus not strongly showcasing local traditions.
2.  The Jahaz Mahal in Mandu features a unique architectural design incorporating a double pavilion offering panoramic views of the Narmada valley, unlike typical Indo-Islamic structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the Pathan architecture of Mandu, exemplified by the Jama Masjid, bears a strong resemblance to Imperial Delhi's structures, thereby limiting the expression of distinct local traditions. This highlights the syncretic nature of Indo-Islamic architecture, often blending regional styles with those of dominant centers of power.  The description of the mosque's features – monumental gateway, squat dome, columned cloisters, and red sandstone facing – further supports this observation.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage details the Jahaz Mahal's unique design as a double pavilion situated on the southern embattlements, providing a scenic view of the Narmada valley. This feature is not a common element in other described Indo-Islamic buildings, signifying a specific adaptation to the Mandu environment and a unique architectural solution. The mention of other structures in Mandu such as Rani Rupmati's pavilion and Baz Bahadur's palace further emphasizes the distinct character of Mandu's architectural landscape.  The double pavilion, therefore, illustrates a successful integration of aesthetics with the geographical setting, a key consideration in architectural design.


**2. With reference to the Taj Mahal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Taj Mahal's construction, completed in approximately 20 years, involved over 20,000 specialized workers, showcasing the immense scale and organization of Mughal imperial projects.
2. The Taj Mahal's symmetrical design, utilizing white marble contrasted with red sandstone, is primarily inspired by Persian architectural traditions, with minimal Indian influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the Taj Mahal's construction, starting in 1632, took nearly twenty years and utilized the skills of 20,000 specialized workers.  This demonstrates the significant human and logistical resources mobilized for such a monumental project, reflecting the power and organization of the Mughal empire. The scale of the workforce involved highlights the advanced level of planning, management, and specialized craftsmanship needed for such an intricate undertaking.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Taj Mahal certainly incorporates elements of Persian architectural influence, which was common during the Mughal period, it also significantly integrates Indian architectural and decorative techniques. The text highlights features like the "Chahar Bagh" layout (a Persian garden design), but also the use of Indian marble from Makrana mines and intricate Indian stone carving, jalis, and pietra dura work. The fusion of styles is a key aspect of the Taj Mahal's unique architectural identity and is not solely based on Persian inspiration. The description of the tomb's structural stylisation with chamfers, arches, and contrasting planes and shades, indicates a blend of architectural traditions.


**3. With reference to the Gol Gumbad, consider the following statements:**

1. Though unfinished, the Gol Gumbad's massive dome and unique acoustic properties exemplify the grandeur and mastery of Indo-Islamic architecture, even in an incomplete state.
2. The Gol Gumbad's construction employed primarily local materials readily available in Bijapur, showcasing a regional adaptation of Indo-Islamic architectural principles.  

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that despite being unfinished, the Gol Gumbad symbolizes the grandeur and majesty of Indo-Islamic architecture. The text emphasizes the monument's impressive scale and the unique acoustic properties of its dome, showcasing the advanced architectural and engineering skills of the time.  The fact that its unfinished state does not diminish its impact on viewers highlights the inherent power and artistry of the design.  The incomplete nature of the structure doesn't detract from its significance as a testament to architectural ambition and achievement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the passage mentions the use of local materials in some Indo-Islamic structures, it does not provide specific information regarding the Gol Gumbad's construction materials.  To infer that it primarily used local materials would be an assumption.  The focus on the grandeur of the dome and the incomplete nature of the structure overshadows any specific details about the materials used.  Therefore, it's impossible to definitively state whether local materials were predominantly used.


**4. With reference to the Jama Masjid, Delhi, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jama Masjid in Delhi, built for congregational Friday prayers, played a pivotal role in the socio-cultural life of medieval Delhi, facilitating both religious and commercial interactions.
2. The architectural plan of the Jama Masjid in Delhi is characterized by a unique, octagonal central courtyard, distinct from the standard three-sided cloister design found in other large mosques.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage describes the Jama Masjid's function as a central location for Friday prayers, which also served as a hub for commercial and cultural exchange.  The text highlights that the mosque and its surroundings became a focal point for the lives of both Muslim and non-Muslim populations, due to the concentration of commercial and cultural activities alongside religious practices. This underscores the mosque's significant role in the broader socio-political fabric of medieval society. The importance of the Khutba (Friday sermon) is also mentioned, emphasizing its role in disseminating the ruler's pronouncements and laws.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage describes a typical large mosque plan as having an open courtyard surrounded on three sides by cloisters, with the Qibla Liwan (prayer niche) located on the western side.  The Jama Masjid in Delhi is presented as adhering to this standard plan, not possessing a unique octagonal courtyard design. The provided diagram of a Jama Masjid's plan further supports this observation.  The question attempts to mislead by suggesting a deviation from the norm.


**5. With reference to the Hoysala temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. Hoysala temples, characterized by their stellate plans and intricate soapstone carvings, are classified as a distinct "Vesara" style, blending Dravida and Nagara architectural elements.
2.  The Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid, a prime example of Hoysala architecture, features a single, towering shikhara, unlike other Hoysala temples that have multiple smaller towers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage identifies the stellate plan and profuse carvings in soapstone as characteristic features of Hoysala temples.  It also explicitly classifies their style as "hybrid" or "Vesara," resulting from a unique combination of Dravida and Nagara elements. This description highlights the innovative and distinct character of Hoysala architecture, setting it apart from the purely Dravida or Nagara styles. The mention of the relative softness of soapstone and its impact on the intricacy of the carvings further supports this point.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage describes the Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid as a "double building" with a large mandapa, but more importantly, it states that the original towers (shikharas) at both Halebid and Belur have long since fallen.  The current appearance of the temples can only be inferred from miniature versions near the entrances.  Therefore, claiming that it features a single, towering shikhara, in contrast to other Hoysala temples, is inaccurate and contradicts the provided information.  The question uses the lack of existing towers to create a misleading comparison.



**6. With reference to Buddhist and Jain architectural developments in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nalanda University, a major Buddhist monastic university, housed monasteries representing all three Buddhist doctrines – Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana – attracting monks from across Asia.
2.  The Jain temples at Mount Abu, built by Vimal Shah, are characterized by an ornate exterior facade, contrasting sharply with their relatively plain interiors, unlike other Jain temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage confirms that Nalanda University was a significant Buddhist monastic center where Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana doctrines were taught.  It also mentions the university's international reach, attracting monks from China, Tibet, Central Asia, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia.  This description highlights Nalanda's crucial role in the dissemination of Buddhist teachings and its influence on the broader cultural landscape of Asia. The mention of Xuan Zang's records further validates the historical significance of this site.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage describes the Jain temples at Mount Abu as having a simplistic exterior in contrast to their exuberant marble interiors.  This description directly contradicts the statement which suggests an ornate exterior.  The passage emphasizes the contrast between the plain exterior and the richly decorated interior, highlighting the unique aesthetic choice made in these temples.  The question creates a false contrast to mislead the candidate.


**7. With reference to Ajanta cave paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. The largest sculptural panel at Ajanta, depicting Mara's army and the Buddha, exhibits a unique arrangement of figures, unlike other large images found in Ajanta caves or painted panels.
2. Ajanta cave paintings, spanning from the first century BCE to the fifth century CE, showcase a consistent stylistic approach, characterized by a uniform use of colors and a linear arrangement of figures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage describes the largest sculptural panel at Ajanta as uniquely complex in its arrangement of figures, contrasting with other large images in the caves or painted panels.  The description of the panel's composition, including Mara's army, dancing figures, and the Buddha, highlights the exceptional nature of this artwork. The comparison to Aurangabad caves further emphasizes the distinctness of this particular panel.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions that Ajanta paintings display typological variations across different periods, particularly between the first century BCE and the fifth century CE.  The description of the paintings from the earlier phase (Cave No. 9 and 10) as having sharp lines and limited colors, in contrast to the later paintings (Cave Nos. 16, 17, 1, and 2) with more rhythmic lines and varied colors, demonstrates the stylistic evolution and diversity within the Ajanta collection.  The question falsely presents a stylistic uniformity across the different periods.


**8. With reference to the Vijayanagara and Nayaka painting styles, consider the following statements:**

1.  Early Vijayanagara paintings, exemplified by those at Tiruparakunram, feature profile faces with large, frontal eyes, slender waists, and a two-dimensional representation of figures and objects.
2. Nayaka paintings of the 17th and 18th centuries, found in various temples, largely abandoned the profile view in favour of frontal representations, showcasing a complete departure from Vijayanagara stylistic conventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage describes early Vijayanagara paintings as using profile faces with large frontal eyes, narrow waists, and a two-dimensional representation of figures. This stylistic approach is consistent with the description of paintings at Tiruparakunram, showcasing characteristics of the early Vijayanagara style.  The mention of the panels depicting Vidyaranya and Vishnu's incarnations further supports the description.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the passage notes some regional modifications and incorporations in Nayaka paintings, it does not state that they abandoned the profile view completely.  The description of Nayaka paintings indicates a continuation of some Vijayanagara stylistic conventions, such as the profile view of figures, alongside regional adaptations.  The mention of the Nataraja painting at Tiruvalanjuli, which likely uses a profile view, further supports the idea of stylistic continuity.

**1. With reference to Indo-Islamic architecture in Mandu, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama Masjid in Mandu, characterized by red sandstone and smaller domes atop columned cloisters, demonstrates a distinct departure from the architectural traditions of Imperial Delhi.
2. Mandu's Pathan architecture, while exhibiting features like jalis and carved brackets, is considered too similar to Imperial Delhi's structures to represent a unique local style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho is indeed a nagara style temple built in 954 CE and does feature four smaller temples in the corners, it does *not* follow a panchayatana plan. The panchayatana plan involves five shrines arranged in a specific pattern, which is not the case with the Lakshmana temple.  The statement incorrectly attributes a specific architectural plan to the temple. Statement 2 is correct. The Sun Temple at Modhera, Gujarat, built in the early 11th century, does indeed display a latina-style shikhara (though the description is simplified) and features the open sabha mandapa, typical of Western Indian temple architecture.  This is a significant example of Solanki architecture. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct, making (b) the right answer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jama Masjid in Mandu does have a monumental gateway, the description in the provided text specifies that the dome atop it is described as "squat," not large and elaborately decorated.  The emphasis is on the relative simplicity of the dome in contrast to the overall scale of the gateway.  Pathan architecture in Mandu, while influenced by Imperial Delhi, isn't characterized by overwhelmingly large and ornate domes in this specific instance. The description highlights a more restrained aesthetic.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the presence of a mimbar supported by carved brackets and a mihrab with a lotus bud fringe within the Jama Masjid. These details highlight the blend of architectural styles, incorporating decorative elements that show a departure from purely austere Pathan style, indicating a local influence and adaptation within the broader Indo-Islamic architectural tradition. The use of carved brackets and the lotus bud fringe (a motif not typically associated with purely Pathan styles) points to a synthesis of styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly describes the Taj Mahal complex as having a symmetrical layout. The central mausoleum is positioned to take advantage of the river bank and is framed by the monumental gateway.  The presence of a red sandstone mosque to the west and a similar structure to the east is mentioned, directly supporting the claim of a deliberate attempt at balance and symmetry in the design. This reflects a key principle of Mughal architecture.

Statement 2 is also correct. The source material clearly states that the marble used in the Taj Mahal was quarried from the Makrana mines in Rajasthan and that the white marble of the main tomb contrasts with the red sandstone of the surrounding buildings. This use of contrasting materials is a deliberate design choice that enhances the visual impact of the structure. The text provides factual support for this statement.


**3. With reference to the Indo-Islamic architectural features described in the text, consider the following statements:**

1.  The use of jalis, carved brackets, and pietra dura inlay work was limited to the interior spaces of prominent mosques and tombs, serving primarily as decorative elements.
2.  Minars, such as the Qutub Minar and Chand Minar, were primarily used for the azaan (call to prayer) and served as symbols of the ruler's power and authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions the use of jalis, carved brackets, and pietra dura not only in interior spaces but also as surface embellishments on the exterior of structures. These decorative elements were integral to the overall aesthetic of Indo-Islamic architecture and were not confined to interior spaces alone. The description of the Hoshang Shah's tomb highlights this point, describing its use of lattice work and carved brackets.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that minars, exemplified by the Qutub Minar and Chand Minar, were used for the azaan and served as symbols of the ruler's power. The immense height of these structures served not only a practical function but also a symbolic one, representing the ruler's authority and the reach of their power.  This is a well-established fact about the function and symbolism of minars within Indo-Islamic architecture.


**4. With reference to the Gol Gumbad, consider the following statements:**

1. Despite being unfinished, the Gol Gumbad's massive dome and unique acoustic properties stand as a testament to the grandeur of Indo-Islamic architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text, while not explicitly detailing the acoustic properties, does mention the Gol Gumbad's unfinished state and its symbolic representation of grandeur and majesty within Indo-Islamic architecture. The sheer scale and architectural ambition of the structure, even in an incomplete form, convey a sense of power and sophistication.  The text implicitly supports this claim by associating the monument with the broader narrative of Indo-Islamic architectural achievement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text does not provide information regarding the materials used in the construction of the Gol Gumbad.  Therefore, any statement about the specific materials used is unsupported by the provided information. This makes it a plausible distractor as many Indo-Islamic structures did utilize red sandstone.


**5. With reference to the architectural styles prevalent in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The "latina" or "rekha-prasada" style of shikhara, characterized by a square base and inward-curving walls, is primarily associated with South Indian temple architecture.
2. The "phamsana" style, featuring a broader, shorter structure with a roof composed of gently rising slabs, is frequently used for mandapas in North Indian temples, complementing the "latina" style garbhagrihas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly associates the "latina" or "rekha-prasada" style of shikhara with *North* Indian temple architecture, not South Indian.  The description of the style and its presence in temples like Deogarh directly contradict the statement.  This is a crucial distinction in understanding the regional variations within Indian temple architecture.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the "phamsana" style is often used for mandapas in North Indian temples, frequently in conjunction with "latina" style garbhagrihas.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nataraja, the iconic image of Shiva as the cosmic dancer, reached its full artistic expression during the Chola period.  The complex iconography of the Nataraja, balancing on one leg, suppressing the demon of ignorance, and embodying cosmic cycles, is brilliantly rendered in Chola bronzes. Numerous variations of this iconic pose were created, showcasing the artists' skill in capturing dynamic movement and conveying profound spiritual meaning.  This evolution and diversification of the Nataraja image during the Chola era is a hallmark of their artistic achievement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Kalyanasundara Murti, depicting the marriage of Shiva and Parvati, is depicted in Chola art not as a single unified image, but rather as two separate statuettes.  This representation emphasizes the distinct yet complementary roles of Shiva and Parvati within the Hindu pantheon. The ingenious method of showing the marriage ceremony with two separate figures reflects a unique approach to representing a pivotal religious event.  The separate statuettes allow for a more nuanced portrayal of the individual characters and their emotions during the sacred union.

Sculptors aimed to capture the likenesses of royal patrons, preserving their images for future generations.  This shift towards portraiture reflects a change in artistic patronage and a growing focus on the individual within the larger context of royal power and religious devotion. The combination of realistic portrayal and idealization demonstrates a sophisticated artistic approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While life-size standing portrait statues of Krishnadevaraya and his two queens were indeed cast in bronze during the Vijayanagara period, they were created at Tirupati, not Madurai.  Tirupati's association with the famous Venkateswara Temple likely contributed to the choice of this location for the royal portraits. The statues, in praying posture, exemplify the combination of realistic facial features and idealized physical forms characteristic of Vijayanagara art. The location detail is crucial for accurate factual recall in this context.


**5. With reference to the lost-wax process of bronze casting, consider the following statements:**

This colossal work is a masterpiece of Indian sculpture, notable for its multi-tiered composition.  The deep carvings and skillful use of volume create a strong sense of three-dimensionality, bringing the dramatic scene to life.  The detailed portrayal of Ravana, Shiva, Parvati, and other figures, along with the dynamic interplay of light and shadow, showcases the exceptional artistic talent of the Ellora artisans. The scale and complexity of this sculpture set it apart as a significant achievement in Indian rock-cut architecture and sculpture.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The sculptures of the Kailashnath Temple, and indeed much of the Ellora cave art, are characterized by their pronounced volume and three-dimensionality.  The artists skillfully manipulated the rock to create deep recesses and projecting forms, adding depth and dynamism to their creations.  The interplay of light and shadow further enhances the three-dimensional effect, making the figures appear more lifelike and engaging.  The use of volume is a key feature of Ellora's sculptural style, differentiating it from other rock-cut traditions that might favor flatter, relief-based representations.  The statement incorrectly contrasts the Kailashnath Temple's sculptures with the overall style of Ellora.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Hoysaleshvara Temple at Halebid, though dedicated to Shiva as Nataraja and possessing a complex design arising from a central square, does *not* have a single, towering shikhara in the Dravidian style.  Its original shikhara, along with that of the Belur temple, has long since fallen. The Hoysala style is often described as a hybrid or Vesara style, blending elements of both Nagara and Dravidian styles, but not strictly adhering to either.  The description of a single, towering Dravidian shikhara is inaccurate.


**2. Consider the following statements about Vijayanagara architecture:**

1. Vijayanagara architecture is characterized by a complete rejection of pre-existing Dravidian temple styles, instead favouring entirely novel designs influenced by Islamic architecture from neighbouring sultanates.
2. The city of Vijayanagara, founded in 1336, attracted numerous international travelers, whose accounts provide valuable insights into the kingdom's architectural achievements and cultural fusion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Vijayanagara architecture demonstrates a synthesis of Dravidian temple architecture with Islamic styles, not a complete rejection of the former.  The architectural style reflects a conscious effort to incorporate and blend elements from both traditions, resulting in a unique hybrid style that showcases the cultural exchange and fusion of the time.  It did not entirely abandon the established Dravidian forms but rather adapted and integrated them.

Statement 2 is correct.  The establishment of Vijayanagara in 1336 attracted numerous international travelers, including Italians like Niccolo di Conti, Portuguese such as Domingo Paes, Fernao Nuniz, and Duarte Barbosa, and the Afghan Abd al-Razzaq. These travelers left detailed accounts of the city, its architecture, and its vibrant cultural landscape. These accounts serve as crucial primary sources for understanding the city's significance and the cultural interactions it fostered.


**3. With reference to temple architecture in Central India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dashavatara Temple at Deogarh, built in the early sixth century CE, exemplifies the panchayatana style, featuring a central shrine and four smaller subsidiary shrines arranged at the cardinal points, all constructed from grey basalt.
2. Khajuraho temples, constructed in the tenth century CE, are characterized by tall, curvilinear shikharas in the Nagara style, showcasing a significant advancement in the complexity and scale compared to earlier temples like the one at Deogarh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Dashavatara Temple at Deogarh is indeed an excellent example of the panchayatana style, with a central shrine and four subsidiary shrines, and was built in the early sixth century CE, it was constructed from sandstone, not grey basalt.  The use of sandstone is a common feature of many temples in the region. The material choice is a significant aspect of the temple's construction and relates to the availability of resources in the area.

Statement 2 is correct. The Khajuraho temples, built around the tenth century CE, represent a significant leap in the evolution of Nagara temple architecture. Their tall, curvilinear shikharas, compared to the relatively simpler structures of earlier temples like the one at Deogarh, demonstrate a considerable increase in complexity, scale, and decorative detail. This evolution reflects advancements in architectural techniques and the patronage of the Chandela dynasty.


**4. With reference to the Sun Temple at Modhera, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sun Temple at Modhera, built in the early eleventh century by Raja Bhimdev I of the Solanki dynasty, features a latina-style shikhara, typical of Nagara architecture.
2. The temple's central shrine, facing east, is devoid of carvings to allow direct sunlight to penetrate during the equinoxes, while the surrounding structures are lavishly decorated with wood carving-inspired sculptures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sun Temple at Modhera does *not* feature a latina-style shikhara.  While it is a significant example of temple architecture in the region, its architectural style is distinct and doesn't conform precisely to the latina (rekha-prasada) type of shikhara found in other Nagara temples. The Solanki architectural style has its own unique features.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sun Temple at Modhera, built by Raja Bhimdev I, is oriented towards the east.  Its central shrine is intentionally left uncarved to allow direct sunlight to enter during the equinoxes. This reflects a sophisticated understanding of astronomy and its incorporation into temple design. The other parts of the temple complex, however, are richly adorned with intricate carvings and sculptures, showing the influence of the wood carving tradition of Gujarat.


**5. With reference to the sculptural traditions of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nalanda school of sculpture, flourishing from the ninth century onwards, was heavily influenced by the Gupta style of Sarnath, but also integrated local Bihar traditions and central Indian influences, resulting in a distinctive style characterized by crowded compositions and flat relief sculptures.
2. The Mathura school of sculpture, particularly prominent during the Kushana period, is known for its sculptures with light volume, fleshy bodies, broad shoulders, and the sanghati (monk's robe) covering only one shoulder, prominently visible covering the left hand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nalanda school of sculpture, while indeed influenced by the Sarnath Gupta style, did *not* feature crowded compositions or primarily flat relief sculptures.  Instead, it was characterized by precisely executed sculptures with an ordered appearance, three-dimensional forms, and detailed back slabs.  The description provided contradicts the actual characteristics of Nalanda sculptures.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mathura school of sculpture, especially during the Kushana period, is accurately described in the statement.  The sculptures possess light volume, fleshy bodies, broad shoulders, and the sanghati is depicted in the manner stated. This specific depiction of the sanghati is a hallmark of the Mathura style and helps distinguish it from other sculptural traditions.


**6. With reference to the cave architecture of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ajanta caves, featuring both chaitya and vihara caves, showcase a continuous tradition of cave excavation from the second century BCE to the sixth century CE, with consistent stylistic elements across all phases.
2. The Ellora caves, unique for their representation of Buddhist, Brahmanical, and Jain faiths, demonstrate a remarkable stylistic eclecticism, incorporating diverse regional styles from Vidarbha, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu into their sculptures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ajanta caves do indeed include both chaitya and vihara caves and span a considerable period, their styles are not consistent across all phases.  The earlier and later phases of Ajanta cave paintings and sculptures show distinct stylistic differences reflecting the evolution of artistic traditions and changing patronage.  The statement oversimplifies the complex chronological and stylistic development.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Ellora caves are indeed exceptional for their representation of three major religious traditions—Buddhist, Brahmanical, and Jain—and their sculptures demonstrate a remarkable confluence of styles.  The involvement of artisans from diverse regions like Vidarbha, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu contributed to this eclecticism, making Ellora a unique example of artistic synthesis in Indian art history.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding Bronze Sculptures in India:**

1.  Bronze sculptures from the Gupta and Post-Gupta periods (5th-7th centuries CE) in North India, particularly Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, frequently depict standing Buddha images with a sanghati (monk's robe) draped so that the folds are treated as a series of drooping down curves, similar to the Mathura style.
2.  The Akota hoard of bronzes, discovered near Vadodara, features primarily Hindu deities, showcasing a distinct regional style that blends elements of the Gupta and Vakataka traditions, with a preference for dynamic, action-filled poses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bronze sculptures from the Gupta and Post-Gupta periods in North India often depict standing Buddha figures.  The sanghati is frequently rendered with the folds treated as a series of drooping curves, echoing stylistic elements seen in Mathura sculptures. This stylistic continuity highlights the influence of established artistic traditions on later bronze casting.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Akota hoard primarily features Jain Tirthankaras, not Hindu deities. The bronzes, created using the lost-wax process, often depict the Tirthankaras seated on thrones, sometimes individually or in groups. The style blends elements of Gupta and Vakataka traditions, but the statement inaccurately characterizes the religious subject matter of the sculptures.  The emphasis on dynamic poses is also not a defining characteristic of this hoard.


**8. With reference to the Indo-Islamic architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama Masjid at Mandu, while displaying elements of Pathan architecture, demonstrates a strong regional identity distinct from the architectural styles prevalent in Imperial Delhi.
2. The Taj Mahal, built in Agra by Shah Jahan, utilizes a symmetrical plan and elevation, featuring red sandstone as the primary building material, complemented by intricate pietra dura inlay work.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pathan architecture of Mandu is considered quite close to the styles of Imperial Delhi, not significantly distinct. While regional variations exist, the overall architectural language shares considerable similarities with structures in Delhi. The statement misrepresents the degree of regional uniqueness in Mandu's architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Taj Mahal does indeed utilize a symmetrical plan and elevation and features intricate pietra dura inlay, the primary building material is white marble, not red sandstone. Red sandstone is used in complementary structures within the Taj Mahal complex, but the mausoleum itself is primarily constructed from white marble.  The statement incorrectly identifies the main building material.


**9. With reference to Mural Painting traditions in South India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The early phase of Vijayanagara style paintings, exemplified by works at Tiruparakunram, is characterized by figures depicted with faces shown in profile, large frontal eyes, and narrow waists, with compositions arranged in rectilinear compartments.
2.  Nayaka paintings of the 17th and 18th centuries, while building upon the Vijayanagara style, show a departure from the use of profile views for faces, opting instead for a more frontal representation, and a greater emphasis on three-dimensionality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Early Vijayanagara paintings, as seen in examples from Tiruparakunram, indeed feature figures with profile views for faces, large frontal eyes, and narrow waists. Compositions are often arranged within rectilinear compartments, reflecting established stylistic conventions of the time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Nayaka paintings, while building upon the Vijayanagara style, largely *retain* the use of profile views for faces.  While there might be regional variations and some experimentation, the consistent use of profile views remains a key characteristic. The statement misrepresents the consistent stylistic element of profile views in Nayaka paintings. The increased emphasis on three-dimensionality is also an overstatement; while there might be a slight shift, the overall approach remains largely two-dimensional.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the characteristics of Buddhist caves in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ajanta caves are unique for their excavated triple-storeyed structures, a feat unmatched by Ellora caves.
2.  While all caves initially featured plaster and paintwork, these are largely lost today.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that Ellora boasts the unique achievement of triple-storeyed caves, not Ajanta. Ajanta does have double-storeyed caves, but this is not unique to them.  The statement incorrectly reverses the facts.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly mentions that all the caves at both Ajanta and Ellora were plastered and painted, but that little to none of this original decoration remains visible today. This is a factual detail about the state of preservation of these historical sites. Option (b) accurately reflects this fact. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the information about the unique features of Ajanta and Ellora caves and the state of their original paintwork.


**2. With reference to the sculptural styles of Ellora caves, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cave No. 14 represents the only double-storeyed excavation dedicated to Brahmanical faith.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the Taj Mahal's construction took nearly twenty years and involved 20,000 specialized workers, not ten years and 10,000 workers.

2.  The rock paintings at Bhimbetka primarily depict hunting scenes, with limited representations of other themes or aspects of daily life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that the first discovery of rock paintings in India was made by Archibold Carlleyle in 1867-68, *before* the discovery of Altamira in Spain, but it does not specify Bhimbetka as the location of this first discovery.  Bhimbetka was discovered later.  The statement incorrectly connects the earliest discovery with Bhimbetka. The chronology of discoveries highlights the historical context of the research and the evolution of understanding of prehistoric art.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While hunting scenes are a prominent feature of Bhimbetka paintings, the text explicitly mentions a wide range of themes, including daily life activities, sacred and royal images, dancing, music, and other scenes. The statement incorrectly limits the thematic scope of Bhimbetka paintings. The wide range of themes in Bhimbetka paintings reflects the diverse aspects of prehistoric life and the artistic expression of various experiences.

1. The Lakshmana temple, dedicated to Vishnu, is the smallest temple at Khajuraho, built in a simple panchayatana style with a single, unadorned shikhara.
2. Khajuraho temples are renowned for their extensive erotic sculptures, which are integrated into the overall artistic vision, representing a balanced view of human experience alongside spiritual pursuits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes the Lakshmana temple as the "grandest temple of Khajuraho," built on a high platform with multiple smaller temples at the corners and multiple, tall, curved shikharas. The statement incorrectly describes the size and architectural style of the Lakshmana temple. The description of the Lakshmana temple highlights its scale, architectural features, and its position within the Khajuraho temple complex.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately points out Khajuraho temples' fame for their extensive erotic sculptures, emphasizing their integration into the artistic vision as a balanced representation of human experience along with spiritual pursuits. The statement correctly identifies a key feature and artistic significance of Khajuraho temples. The presence of erotic sculptures reflects the artistic and cultural values of the period and the integration of various aspects of human experience within religious art.



**1. With reference to Hoysala temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. Hoysala temples, characterized by their stellate plan, are exclusively built using granite, showcasing the mastery of sculptors over hard stone.
2. The Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid, dedicated to Shiva as Nataraja, features a single building with a mandapa for music and dance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Hoysala temples are renowned for their intricate stellate plans, they are primarily constructed from soapstone (a relatively soft stone), not granite. The use of soapstone allowed for the incredibly detailed and delicate carvings characteristic of Hoysala art.  The ease of carving soapstone, however, is often misinterpreted as a lack of skill.  The intricacy of the work, particularly in the depiction of jewelry and the unique poses of hundreds of elephants, demonstrates exceptional sculptural mastery. Granite, being far harder, would have presented significantly different challenges and aesthetic outcomes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid is, in fact, a *double* building, comprising two structures with separate mandapas designed to facilitate music and dance.  Each building is also preceded by a Nandi pavilion, further emphasizing the temple's dual nature. The description of a single building with one mandapa misrepresents the complex architectural layout of this significant Hoysala temple. This dual structure reflects a sophisticated understanding of space and ritual function within the temple complex.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The architectural style of Vijayanagara is purely Dravidian, reflecting a consistent adherence to traditional South Indian temple architecture.
2.  Foreign accounts, such as those by Niccolo di Conti and Domingo Paes, provide detailed descriptions of Vijayanagara's vibrant literary traditions but lack information on its architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The architecture of the Vijayanagara Empire is a fascinating synthesis of Dravidian temple architecture and Islamic styles influenced by neighboring sultanates.  It wasn't a purely Dravidian style but a unique blend reflecting the era's cultural fusion. This fusion is evident in the incorporation of elements from both traditions, creating a distinct architectural vocabulary.  Ignoring the Islamic influence oversimplifies the complexity of Vijayanagara architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While foreign travelers like Niccolo di Conti and Domingo Paes did indeed document Vijayanagara's rich literary traditions, their accounts also offer valuable insights into the city's impressive architecture and urban planning. Their descriptions provide vivid accounts of the scale and grandeur of the city's buildings, contributing significantly to our understanding of Vijayanagara's architectural achievements. To suggest that these accounts lack architectural information is inaccurate.  These foreign accounts, alongside Sanskrit and Telugu texts, provide a multi-faceted view of the empire's culture.


**3. With reference to Buddhist and Jain architectural developments in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Tabo Monastery is located in Sikkim, a region known for its significant Buddhist heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tabo Monastery, a significant Buddhist site, is actually located in Himachal Pradesh, not Sikkim.  Both Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim have rich Buddhist traditions, but the geographical location of Tabo Monastery is crucial for understanding its historical and cultural context within the broader Himalayan Buddhist landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ellora caves are a remarkable example of religious syncretism, featuring Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain monuments side-by-side.  This coexistence showcases the diverse religious landscape of the region and the interaction between different faiths during the period.  Restricting Ellora to Buddhist monuments ignores the significant presence of Hindu and Jain structures within the cave complex.  The diversity of religious representation is a key feature of Ellora's significance.


**4. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. Nalanda University primarily focused on Theravada Buddhism, neglecting other Buddhist schools of thought.
2. The sculptural art of Nalanda, primarily in stucco, stone, and bronze, was heavily influenced by the Buddhist art of Mathura, showcasing a clear lineage in artistic styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Its inclusive approach to Buddhist scholarship attracted monks and scholars from across Asia, fostering intellectual exchange and the development of diverse Buddhist traditions. Focusing solely on Theravada misrepresents the university's comprehensive approach to Buddhist studies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the sculptural art of Nalanda did initially show a strong dependence on the Buddhist art of Sarnath (and not Mathura), it eventually evolved into a distinct "Nalanda school" characterized by unique facial features, body forms, and the treatment of clothing and jewelry. This distinct style emerged from a synthesis of Sarnath/Gupta traditions, local Bihar styles, and influences from central India, creating a unique artistic identity. Attributing the influence solely to Mathura ignores the significant role of Sarnath and the development of a unique Nalanda style.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lad Khan temple at Aihole is not an example of Dravidian architecture. Instead, it is believed to be inspired by the wooden-roofed temples of the hills, demonstrating a unique adaptation of regional building traditions into stone architecture.  The temple's stylistic features are distinct from the characteristics of Dravidian architecture, which are primarily found in South India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Durga temple at Aihole is indeed unique for its early apsidal shrine, a feature reminiscent of Buddhist chaitya halls. This architectural element showcases the blending of architectural influences and the creative integration of different styles within a single structure. The apsidal form, typically associated with Buddhist architecture, is a significant feature distinguishing the Durga temple from other structures in Aihole.  This fusion highlights the dynamic interaction of religious and architectural traditions in the region.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kailashnath temple at Ellora is indeed a monolithic rock-cut temple carved from a single rock, representing an extraordinary achievement in rock-cut architecture.  The scale and precision of the carving, the intricate detail of the sculptures, and the overall architectural design showcase the exceptional skill and ingenuity of the artisans involved. The monolithic nature of the temple is a key aspect of its unique character.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The sculptures of the Kailashnath temple are not characterized by a static or restrained style.  Quite the opposite, they are known for their dynamic quality, often larger-than-life size, infused with grandeur and energy. The figures are expressive, showcasing movement and emotion, contrasting sharply with the notion of simplicity and minimalism. The sculptures demonstrate a masterful understanding of three-dimensional form and the creation of dynamic visual narratives.


**7. With reference to the architectural features of Odisha temples, consider the following statements:**

1. Odisha temples are exclusively classified under the Dravidian style, reflecting a consistent adherence to South Indian architectural principles.
2. The Sun Temple at Konark, originally featuring a colossal shikhara, is a prime example of the rekhapida order within the Odisha temple classification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Odisha temples constitute a distinct sub-style *within* the Nagara order, not the Dravidian style.  While Dravidian architecture is prominent in South India, Odisha's temple architecture possesses unique features that set it apart and classify it under the Nagara style, characterized by its distinctive shikhara (deul in Odisha).  Confusing the two styles misrepresents the unique characteristics of Odisha temple architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sun Temple at Konark, though a magnificent example of Odisha temple architecture, doesn't belong to the rekhapida order.  Odisha temples are classified into three orders: rekhapida, pidhadeul, and khakra.  Konark's architectural features align more closely with the pidhadeul or khakra orders, depending on the specific interpretation of its complex structure.  The rekhapida order is characterized by a simpler, less ornate design than the complex structure of the Konark temple.  Assigning it to the rekhapida order is a simplification of its architectural style.

1.  Temple architecture in the Kumaon region primarily follows the Dravidian style, showcasing the influence of South Indian architectural traditions.
2.  The Pandrethan temple in Kashmir, built during the Karkota period, exhibits a peaked roof design adapted to the snowy climatic conditions of the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Temple architecture in the Kumaon region predominantly follows the Nagara style, not the Dravidian style. While various influences are present in hill temple architecture, the Nagara style, with its characteristic shikharas, is the dominant architectural idiom.  Attributing it solely to the Dravidian style ignores the distinct regional and stylistic features.

Statement 2 is correct. The Pandrethan temple in Kashmir, constructed during the Karkota period, indeed features a peaked roof design. This architectural adaptation is a direct response to the snowy climatic conditions of the region, demonstrating a practical and functional approach to building design in challenging environments. The peaked roof design is a crucial feature distinguishing the temple from structures in other regions.  This demonstrates a strong understanding of the environmental context.


**9. With reference to the  Pallava architecture, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Pallavas did produce significant rock-cut structures, they also constructed numerous structural temples.  The statement that Pallava architecture is *primarily* rock-cut is an oversimplification that overlooks the substantial body of structural temple architecture from the Pallava period.  The existence of both rock-cut and structural temples demonstrates the range of their architectural capabilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram is a significant Pallava monument, the description of its having three shrines dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu is a simplification of its complex history.  The temple's current configuration may reflect additions and modifications made over time, potentially including elements from later periods.  Attributing the three shrines to a deliberate blending of Pallava and Chola styles is an overinterpretation of the available evidence.  The temple's architectural evolution is a complex process not easily characterized as a simple blend.


**10. With reference to the Chola temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. Chola temples are characterized by a single, towering vimana, reflecting a focus on verticality and grandeur.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key feature of the Nagara style of temple architecture. The curvilinear shikhara, a characteristic tower that curves gracefully inward as it rises, is a defining element of this architectural style. The amalaka (a disc-like element) and kalasha (a vase-shaped finial) crown the shikhara, completing the distinctive profile. This architectural form reflects a unique aesthetic sensibility.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While some Nagara style temples might have boundary walls, it is not a universal feature of the style.  The presence of a high compound wall and a prominent gopuram are more characteristic of the Dravida style of temple architecture prevalent in South India. The statement incorrectly attributes a Dravidian feature to the Nagara style.

2. The Sena style, flourishing from the mid-11th to mid-13th centuries, showcased a significant departure from the Pala style, incorporating elements of Dravidian architecture and abandoning the use of amalakas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the characteristics of Pala temple architecture in Bengal.  The temples of this period, often built of stone (like basalt and chlorite), exhibited tall, curving shikharas (the curvilinear tower above the sanctum) topped by large amalakas (disc-shaped elements).  This architectural style shows a clear affinity with the contemporary temple architecture of Odisha, suggesting a regional exchange of ideas and techniques.  Examples like the Siddheshvara Mahadeva temple at Barakar illustrate this style.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Sena period did introduce its own stylistic nuances, it didn't represent a drastic departure from the established Pala style.  The Sena style continued the tradition of tall shikharas, and while variations in ornamentation and detailing might have occurred, the fundamental architectural elements, including the use of amalakas, remained largely consistent with the earlier Pala tradition.  The transition between the Pala and Sena styles was more of an evolution than a complete stylistic break.  A significant change was observed in the sculpture style, but not necessarily in the fundamental architecture. The statement incorrectly attributes Dravidian influence, which is largely absent in Bengal temple architecture of that era.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the iconography and placement of images in Hindu temples:**

1. River goddesses Ganga and Yamuna are typically found flanking the entrance to the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) in Dravidian temples, symbolizing the sacred waters.
2. Dvarapalas (doorkeepers) are commonly positioned at the entrances to the gopurams (tower gateways) of Nagara temples, acting as guardians of the sacred space.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna are indeed frequently depicted in Hindu temple art, their placement is more typical at the entrance of the *garbhagriha* in *Nagara* (North Indian) style temples, representing the sacred rivers that nourish life.  In Dravidian temples, the emphasis is often on the gopurams as grand gateways, and the iconography at those entrances differs.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Dvarapalas, the fierce guardian figures, are characteristically found guarding the entrances of the *gopurams* in *Dravidian* (South Indian) temples.  Nagara temples, while having their own guardian figures, often place them differently within the temple complex, and the gopuram itself is not a prominent feature in the Nagara style.  The placement of these elements is a key distinguishing feature between the two architectural styles.


**3. With reference to the bronze casting techniques in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The "lost-wax" (cire-perdu) method, known since the Indus Valley Civilization, was primarily used for creating utilitarian objects like cooking utensils, with religious iconography being a secondary application.
2.  The use of a five-metal alloy (gold, silver, copper, brass, and lead) for bronze casting was a common practice across various regions of India, particularly during the Chola period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the lost-wax technique is ancient and dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization, its primary application was not limited to utilitarian objects.  From early periods, the technique was extensively used for creating religious iconography (Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain), with sculptures and statuettes of deities being highly valued. While utilitarian objects were also cast, the religious significance of bronze casting is undeniable.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While five-metal alloys were sometimes used in bronze casting (particularly in certain regions and periods for special purposes), it was not a universally common practice across India. The Chola period, known for its exquisite bronze sculptures, typically employed different bronze alloys primarily based on copper, zinc, and tin.  The use of a five-metal alloy was not a defining feature of the Chola bronze casting technique, and its prevalence was regionally and temporally limited.


**4. With reference to the sculptural traditions of North India during the 5th and 6th centuries CE, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mathura school continued to produce sculptures with prominent fleshy bodies and heavy drapery, maintaining the Kushana-period style.
2. The Sarnath school developed a distinct style characterized by slender, well-proportioned figures with transparent drapery, reflecting a shift towards greater elegance and refinement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mathura remained an important sculptural center, the 5th and 6th centuries saw a stylistic shift away from the earlier Kushana emphasis on fleshy bodies and heavy drapery.  The sculptures from this later period in Mathura, while still retaining some of the earlier traditions, exhibited a trend towards greater refinement and a reduction in the extreme fleshiness and heaviness of drapery.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sarnath school of sculpture during the 5th and 6th centuries CE indeed developed a distinct style characterized by slender and elegant figures. The drapery in Sarnath sculptures became more transparent and less heavy, clinging to the body and often appearing almost weightless, creating a sense of fluidity and grace.  This style represents a clear departure from the heavier style of the Kushana period at Mathura and other centers, signifying an evolution in aesthetic sensibilities.


**5.  With reference to the Vijayanagara style of painting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vijayanagara paintings, primarily found in temples and palaces, are characterized by the use of vibrant, luminous colors and a three-dimensional representation of human figures, showing influence from the Kerala mural tradition.
2. The stylistic conventions of Vijayanagara painting, such as profile views of faces and two-dimensional representations of figures and objects within rectilinear compartments, were largely adopted and continued during the Nayaka period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Vijayanagara paintings, while found in temples and palaces, are not known for their vibrant, luminous colors and three-dimensional representation of figures in the same manner as Kerala murals.  Vijayanagara painting style, particularly in its early phase, shows a more restrained palette and maintains a largely two-dimensional representation of figures, placing them within clearly defined compartments.  The influence from Kerala's vibrant and three-dimensional style is minimal.

Statement 2 is correct.  The distinctive stylistic conventions of Vijayanagara painting, including profile views of faces and the two-dimensional representation of figures within rectilinear compartments, were indeed adopted and continued by artists during the subsequent Nayaka period.  While regional variations and minor modifications might have occurred, the fundamental stylistic elements remained consistent across these periods, indicating a continuity of artistic traditions.  The Nayaka period built upon the stylistic foundations laid by the Vijayanagara school.


**6. With reference to the architectural features of Odisha temples, consider the following statements:**

1.  Odisha temples are classified into three orders: rekhapida, pidhadeul, and khakra, each distinguished by unique shikhara (tower) designs.
2.  The Konark Sun Temple, a colossal structure resembling a chariot, exemplifies the pidhadeul style, with its towering shikhara and extensive ornamental carvings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Odisha temple architecture is indeed categorized into three distinct orders: rekhapida, pidhadeul, and khakra. These classifications are based primarily on the shape and design of the *shikhara* (tower) which is a central distinguishing feature of the temple. Each order has its own unique characteristics in terms of the shikhara's profile, height, and ornamentation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Konark Sun Temple, though a magnificent example of Odisha temple architecture, does not belong to the pidhadeul style.  Its design and structure are unique and don't strictly fit into any of the three established classifications. The statement incorrectly associates the pidhadeul style with the towering shikhara and extensive carvings, which while true for Odisha temples in general, is not specific to the pidhadeul order. The Konark temple's design, resembling a colossal chariot, is a distinct and highly individualistic expression of Odisha's architectural genius.


**7. With reference to the  rock-cut cave traditions in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest examples of rock-cut caves in Eastern India are found at the Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves near Bhubaneswar, primarily associated with Buddhist monastic use.
2. The Guntapalle cave site in Andhra Pradesh features a unique combination of structured stupas, viharas, and rock-cut caves, showcasing a diverse approach to Buddhist monastic architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves near Bhubaneswar are indeed significant early rock-cut caves in Eastern India, they are primarily associated with *Jain* monastic use, as evidenced by inscriptions and architectural features.  Buddhist cave traditions in Eastern India also existed, but the Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves represent a predominantly Jain monastic complex.

Statement 2 is correct. The Guntapalle cave site in Andhra Pradesh is indeed unique for its combination of structured stupas (dome-shaped Buddhist monuments), viharas (monasteries), and rock-cut caves, all located within a single complex. This represents a diverse and integrated approach to Buddhist monastic architecture, reflecting the multifaceted nature of early Buddhist settlements.  This unique combination of architectural forms is a notable feature of the Guntapalle site.


**8. With reference to the  development of Buddhist art in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amaravati stupa, initially constructed in the 3rd century BCE, saw its most significant development and embellishment with sculptural reliefs during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, including the addition of Buddha images.
2. The Gandhara school of sculpture, which flourished in the northwestern region (present-day Pakistan), is characterized by its distinct Greco-Roman influence, particularly evident in the representation of Buddha's physical features.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Amaravati stupa, while showing evidence of construction activity in the 3rd century BCE, underwent its major phase of development and embellishment with extensive sculptural reliefs during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE.  A significant feature of this later period was the incorporation of Buddha images in the reliefs, marking a shift in Buddhist iconography.  The earlier phase of the stupa largely lacked such depictions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Gandhara school of sculpture, located in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent, is indeed well-known for its distinctive Greco-Roman influence.  This influence is prominently visible in the representation of the Buddha's physical features, which often exhibit characteristics reminiscent of classical Greek and Roman sculpture, such as the treatment of drapery, facial features, and overall body proportions.  This fusion of Indian and Greco-Roman artistic traditions is a key defining feature of the Gandhara style.


**9. With reference to the  Nalanda school of sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nalanda school, primarily producing sculptures in stucco and stone, developed a unique style characterized by crowded compositions with overlapping figures, reflecting the bustling nature of the monastic university.
2. Nalanda bronzes, dating from the 7th to 12th centuries, initially followed the Sarnath Gupta style, but later incorporated elements of Vajrayana Buddhism, leading to a wider repertoire of deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Nalanda school of sculpture, while producing works in stucco and stone, is not characterized by crowded compositions with significant overlapping of figures.  Instead, the sculptures are generally known for their ordered and balanced compositions, with figures arranged with a sense of clarity and precision.  The statement misrepresents the aesthetic principles of the Nalanda style.

Statement 2 is correct. Nalanda bronzes, produced over a significant period, initially showed a strong dependence on the Sarnath Gupta style.  However, as Nalanda became a prominent center of Vajrayana Buddhism, the repertoire of deities depicted in the bronzes expanded to include a wider range of Vajrayana figures.  This evolution in iconography reflects the changing religious landscape and the growing influence of Vajrayana within the Nalanda monastic complex.  The statement correctly highlights the stylistic evolution and the incorporation of Vajrayana elements.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Chola bronze sculptures:**

1. The Chola period (10th-12th centuries) witnessed the creation of some of the most exquisite bronze sculptures in South India, predominantly depicting Hindu deities, with a focus on Shiva and his various forms.
2. The "lost-wax" technique was not employed by Chola artisans; instead, they utilized a unique method of bronze casting involving the use of large clay molds and the direct pouring of molten metal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chola period is indeed renowned for its exceptional bronze sculptures, which are considered among the finest examples of bronze casting in South India.  The sculptures primarily depict Hindu deities, with a significant focus on Shiva, his various forms (like Nataraja), and other associated figures.  The high level of artistic skill and technical mastery displayed in these sculptures is a defining characteristic of the Chola style.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Chola artisans did, in fact, employ the "lost-wax" technique (cire-perdu) for their bronze castings. This ancient and sophisticated method allowed for the creation of highly detailed and refined sculptures. The statement's claim of a unique, different method is inaccurate. The lost-wax process was central to the production of the renowned Chola bronzes.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.  I have aimed for a "difficult" level by incorporating subtle inaccuracies and requiring detailed knowledge of Indian art history.


**1. With reference to the Pala style of sculpture in Bengal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pala style, flourishing between the 9th and 11th centuries, is named after the Sena dynasty, known for their patronage of Buddhist monastic sites.
2. The Siddheshvara Mahadeva temple in Barakar exemplifies early Pala style, characterized by a tall, curving shikhara and an amalaka, showing similarities to contemporaneous Odisha temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Pala style is actually named after the Pala dynasty, not the Sena dynasty. While the Sena dynasty did patronize art and architecture, it was the Pala dynasty that oversaw the development of the Pala style during the 9th-11th centuries. The statement incorrectly attributes the Pala style to the Sena period, a common error that would mislead less informed candidates. The Sena style succeeded the Pala style.

Statement 2 is correct. The Siddheshvara Mahadeva temple in Barakar is indeed a prime example of early Pala architecture. Its tall, curving shikhara, topped with a large amalaka, reflects the style's characteristics and its connection to the contemporary Odisha temple architecture. This showcases the interconnectedness of artistic influences across different regions of India.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding temple architecture in India:**

1.  The rekha-prasada, a type of nagara shikhara, is characterized by a square base whose walls curve inward to a point at the top, while the phamsana style features a broader, shorter structure with multiple slabs gently rising to a single point.
2.  The valabhi style, a nagara sub-type, is identified by rectangular buildings with a rounded vaulted chamber resembling ancient wagon roofs, frequently used for mandapas in North Indian temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. This statement accurately describes the defining features of both the rekha-prasada and phamsana styles within the nagara order of temple architecture. The contrasting shapes of their shikharas and the way their roofs ascend highlight the diversity within the nagara style.  This requires a clear understanding of architectural terminology and stylistic variations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the valabhi style does indeed feature a rounded vaulted chamber, it's not typically used for mandapas. The description is accurate for the valabhi structure itself, but its application is misrepresented as a common feature of mandapas within nagara temple complexes.  The statement attempts to confuse the candidate by mixing accurate architectural descriptions with an incorrect application.


**3. With reference to the sculptural traditions of the Mauryan period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Didarganj Yakshi, a polished sandstone sculpture, showcases a sophisticated rendering of the female form with detailed musculature and flowing drapery, unlike the more stylized terracotta figurines of the same period.
2. The Sarnath Lion Capital, featuring four addorsed lions atop a circular abacus with animal figures and chakras, originally included a crowning Dharmachakra, now displayed separately at the Sarnath museum.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Didarganj Yakshi is indeed a prime example of Mauryan sculptural skill.  Its polished sandstone surface, realistic depiction of the female form, and detailed rendering of musculature and drapery contrast significantly with the simpler forms of contemporary terracotta figurines. This highlights the sophistication achieved in stone sculpture during the Mauryan era.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Sarnath Lion Capital's original design did include a Dharmachakra (Wheel of Law) as its crowning element.  This detail, now kept separately at the Sarnath museum due to breakage, is a crucial aspect of its iconography and historical significance. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the capital's complete structure and its symbolic meaning.


**4. With reference to Vijayanagara paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. The Virupaksha temple in Hampi showcases Vijayanagara-style paintings depicting events from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and dynastic history, characterized by figures with narrow waists and profile faces featuring large frontal eyes.
2.  Lepakshi's Shiva temple contains examples of Nayaka paintings, a distinct style characterized by rectilinear compartments and two-dimensional figures, demonstrating the continuation of Vijayanagara conventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Virupaksha temple in Hampi does indeed contain Vijayanagara-style paintings with the described characteristics. The description of the stylistic elements accurately reflects the features of the art of that period and tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lepakshi Shiva temple features *Vijayanagara* paintings, not Nayaka paintings. The Nayaka style followed Vijayanagara, inheriting some of its conventions but developing its own distinct characteristics. This subtle distinction aims to test the candidate's understanding of the chronological sequence and stylistic evolution of South Indian painting traditions.  The question uses a common point of confusion to create a difficult distractor.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Sun Temple at Modhera:**

1. Constructed in the early 11th century by Raja Bhimdev I of the Solanki dynasty, it features a massive rectangular stepped tank called the Surya Kund containing 108 miniature shrines carved between the steps and an open sabha mandapa.
2. The temple's central shrine is lavishly carved, contrasting with the extensively detailed ornamentation on the outer walls, reflecting a unique aesthetic choice emphasizing the interior space.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes several key features of the Sun Temple at Modhera, including its builder, date, the Surya Kund with its miniature shrines, and the open sabha mandapa. This demands factual recall of details regarding this significant temple.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement reverses the actual situation. The central shrine of the Modhera Sun Temple is *devoid* of carving, while the outer walls are extensively decorated. The intention is to test the candidate's knowledge of the temple's unique design and the reasoning behind it (allowing sunlight to penetrate the central shrine during equinoxes).  This is a difficult distractor playing on the common expectation of elaborate interior decoration in temples.


These questions require detailed knowledge of Indian art and architecture, going beyond superficial understanding. The distractors are designed to challenge even well-prepared candidates, making this a set of difficult questions suitable for a high-stakes exam like the UPSC.


**1. With reference to Chola bronze sculptures, consider the following statements:**

1.  The lost-wax casting technique, employed in creating Chola bronzes, originated during the Chola period itself.
2.  Chola bronzes primarily depict Hindu deities, with a notable absence of Buddhist or Jain iconography.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The lost-wax casting process, also known as the cire-perdu technique, predates the Chola period significantly.  Evidence suggests its use as far back as the Indus Valley Civilization. While the Cholans refined and mastered the technique, producing exceptionally high-quality bronzes, they did not invent it.  The statement misrepresents the historical development of bronze casting in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Chola bronzes are renowned for their depictions of Hindu deities, particularly Shiva and Parvati in various forms, and also Vishnu,  the assertion that Buddhist or Jain iconography is entirely absent is false.  The text mentions the existence of Jain bronzes from various sites across India, including Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The presence of other religious iconography alongside Hindu themes showcases the religious diversity reflected in Chola-era artistic production.  The statement oversimplifies the complex religious landscape of the period.


**2. With reference to Jain temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu, known for their intricate marble interiors, were constructed entirely of granite.
2.  The tallest monolithic free-standing structure in the world, the Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola, was commissioned by a Chola king.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu are indeed famous for their exquisitely carved marble interiors, contrasting with their simpler exteriors. However, the temples are not made of granite; they are constructed from white marble, a material that allowed for the intricate detailing characteristic of these Jain shrines.  The statement incorrectly identifies the primary building material.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola, a remarkable feat of monolithic sculpture, was indeed commissioned by Camundaraya. However, Camundaraya was the General-in-Chief and Prime Minister of the Ganga Kings of Mysore, not a Chola king. The statement incorrectly attributes the patronage to the wrong dynasty, demonstrating a flawed understanding of the historical context of the sculpture's creation.


**3. With reference to the Ravana shaking Mount Kailasha sculpture at Ellora, consider the following statements:**

1. The sculpture is located on the right wall of the Kailashnath temple (Cave No. 16) at Ellora.
2. The composition features a single-tiered depiction of Ravana, showcasing a simplified representation of the scene.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The description explicitly states that the noteworthy depiction of Ravana shaking Mount Kailasha is found on the *left* wall of the Kailashnath temple (Cave No. 16) at Ellora.  The statement presents a spatial inaccuracy concerning the location of the sculpture within the cave.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text details a multi-tiered composition of the sculpture,  not a single-tiered one.  The description highlights the complexity of the carving, with several tiers depicting Ravana, Shiva, Parvati, and other figures. The multi-layered arrangement demonstrates the sophisticated artistic techniques employed in creating a three-dimensional effect. The statement significantly understates the artistic complexity of the work.


**4. With reference to the artistic traditions of the Gupta period, consider the following statements:**

1. Gupta period bronzes are characterized by a significant use of the tribhanga posture, especially evident in Buddha images.
2. The Mathura school of sculpture, during the Gupta period, is known for its depiction of Buddha images with plain, foldless drapery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text highlights the use of the tribhanga posture (three bends in the body) as a characteristic feature of Gupta period sculptures, particularly in bronze and stone images of the Buddha and other figures. This graceful, S-shaped pose showcases the refinement and elegance of Gupta artistic conventions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that the Mathura school of sculpture, while exhibiting diverse styles, continued to depict Buddha images with detailed, flowing drapery, showcasing folds and movement.  It was the Sarnath style that is characterized by foldless drapery. The statement incorrectly attributes the foldless drapery style to the Mathura school.


**5. With reference to the architectural styles of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hoysala temples are characterized by a distinct nagara-style shikhara, easily distinguishable from Dravidian architecture.
2.  The stellate plan, a star-like ground plan, is a prominent feature of the Vijayanagara temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Hoysala temples exhibit a unique architectural style often termed "vesara," a hybrid style blending elements of both Nagara and Dravidian architecture. Their shikharas are not purely Nagara in style, making the statement inaccurate. The statement mischaracterizes the distinct architectural features of Hoysala temples.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text specifically mentions the stellate plan as a defining characteristic of Hoysala temples, not Vijayanagara temples. These temples, with their complex, star-like ground plans, demonstrate the advanced architectural capabilities of the Hoysala period. The statement correctly identifies a key architectural feature, although it associates it with the wrong dynasty.  The Vijayanagara style synthesized Dravidian temple architecture with Islamic influences,  not the stellate plan.


**6. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda was primarily a center for Theravada Buddhist studies, with limited exposure to Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions.
2.  The sculptures at Nalanda show a blend of Sarnath Gupta, local Bihar, and central Indian styles, forming a distinct Nalanda school of sculpture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Nalanda University taught all three major Buddhist doctrines: Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana.  The statement incorrectly restricts the range of Buddhist traditions taught at Nalanda, thereby misrepresenting its intellectual breadth.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly describes the Nalanda school of sculpture as a synthesis of Sarnath Gupta, local Bihar, and central Indian artistic styles.  This fusion of influences resulted in a distinct artistic style characterized by specific facial features, body forms, and treatments of clothing and jewelry. The statement accurately reflects the evolution and characteristics of the Nalanda sculptural tradition.


**7. With reference to early Indian rock-cut architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest examples of rock-cut caves in Odisha are Buddhist, predating Jain caves in the region.
2. The Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves near Bhubaneswar are primarily associated with Buddhist monastic traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the earliest examples of rock-cut caves in Odisha, the Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves, are associated with Jain monks, as evidenced by inscriptions of Kharavela kings.  The statement incorrectly identifies the primary religious affiliation of the earliest Odisha rock-cut caves.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves are explicitly identified in the text as being primarily associated with Jain monastic traditions, not Buddhist ones. The statement misattributes the religious affiliation of these important cave sites.


**8. With reference to the Amaravati Stupa, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amaravati Stupa's construction began in the first century CE and reached its peak during the third century CE.
2. The stupa's sculptural decoration included depictions of events from the life of the Buddha and Jataka tales, but notably lacked depictions of the Buddha himself.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although construction activity at Amaravati is evidenced from the 3rd century BCE, the text states that the stupa was best developed in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE.  The statement incorrectly presents the chronology of the stupa's main construction phase.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Amaravati Stupa initially lacked Buddha images (similar to Sanchi), the text clearly mentions that Buddha images were carved onto the drum slabs and other areas during the later phases (2nd and 3rd centuries CE).  The statement inaccurately describes the presence of Buddha depictions in the stupa's later sculptural decoration.


**9. With reference to the Mathura school of sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mathura sculptures of the second century CE are characterized by a light volume, fleshy bodies, and broad shoulders.
2.  In contrast to the Sarnath style, Mathura sculptures consistently depicted Buddha images with plain, transparent drapery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text describes Mathura sculptures from the second century CE as having a light volume, fleshy bodies, and broad shoulders. These features are highlighted as distinguishing characteristics of the Mathura style during that period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly contrasts the Mathura style with the Sarnath style, which featured plain, transparent drapery.  Mathura sculptures, conversely, are described as depicting detailed, folded drapery in their Buddha images. The statement incorrectly attributes the plain drapery style to the Mathura school.


**10. With reference to Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The use of arches capable of supporting the weight of domes was a pre-existing technique in India before the arrival of Islamic architecture.
2.  Indo-Islamic architecture completely rejected pre-existing Indian architectural and decorative forms, creating a wholly new style.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that while arches were used in pre-existing Indian architecture, they were not capable of supporting the weight of large domes in the same way as the archuate forms introduced with Islamic architectural techniques.  The statement misrepresents the structural capabilities of pre-existing Indian arches.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text emphasizes that Indo-Islamic architecture was a synthesis of Islamic architectural practices and pre-existing Indian forms.  It highlights the absorption and adaptation of local cultural elements, resulting in a unique blend of styles. The statement incorrectly portrays Indo-Islamic architecture as a complete break from Indian traditions.

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions Sembiyan Maha Devi as a distinguished patron of bronze casting during the 10th century CE, highlighting the high quality and demand for Chola bronzes.  This statement directly reflects a known historical fact about Chola patronage of the arts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While bronze casting existed during the Pallava period, the text clarifies that while some bronzes were produced then, the most beautiful and exquisite statues were produced during the Chola period (10th-12th centuries CE).  The statement incorrectly implies a continuous and equally skilled practice from the Pallava period onwards, overlooking the significant advancement and refinement achieved during the Chola era. The skill continues today, but the statement wrongly implies the *same level* of skill existed continuously from the Pallava period.  The evolution of bronze casting techniques is a key aspect of art history, and this statement misrepresents that evolution.


**2. With reference to the iconography of Shiva in Chola bronze sculptures, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nataraja image, fully developed during the Chola period, depicts Shiva balancing himself on his left leg, suppressing the apasmara demon with his right foot.
2.  In the Nataraja pose, Shiva's four arms are depicted with the main right hand in abhaya hasta, the upper right holding a damaru, the upper left holding a flame, and the main left hand in dola hasta.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The description of the Nataraja pose states that Shiva balances on his *right* leg, suppressing the apasmara demon with the foot of the *same* (right) leg.  The statement incorrectly reverses the legs involved in the pose, a significant detail in the iconography.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text accurately describes the positions of Shiva's four arms in the Nataraja image, including the mudras (abhaya hasta, dola hasta) and the objects held (damaru, flame).  This demonstrates a precise understanding of the iconographic details of the sculpture. The accuracy of this description makes it a reliable statement.

1.  Life-size standing portrait statues of Krishnadevaraya and his two queens, Tirumalamba and Chinnadevi, were cast in bronze at Tirupati during the 16th century, showcasing a blend of realism and idealization.
2.  Vijayanagara sculptors primarily focused on religious iconography, neglecting portraiture in bronze casting, with religious themes dominating their sculptural output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage directly supports this statement, describing the life-size bronze portraits at Tirupati and mentioning the combination of realistic features and idealization in their creation.  This exemplifies the Vijayanagara period's experimentation with portrait sculpture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly contradicts this statement by giving the example of the life-size bronze portraits of Krishnadevaraya and his queens, demonstrating that Vijayanagara sculptors did indeed create portrait sculptures. The statement incorrectly asserts a focus solely on religious iconography, ignoring the evidence of portraiture.


**4. With reference to the "lost-wax" bronze casting technique in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The lost-wax process, known as cire-perdu, was discovered during the Indus Valley Civilization and involved an alloy of copper, zinc, and lead.

1.  Ajanta caves are known for their single-storied excavations, while Ellora caves uniquely feature triple-storied excavations, representing a significant architectural achievement.
2.  The Buddhist caves at Ellora include images of various Buddhas (like Vairochana, Akshobhya), Bodhisattvas (like Tara, Avalokiteshwara), and other deities associated with Vajrayana Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage mentions that Ajanta *also* has double-storied caves, contradicting the statement's assertion of only single-storied excavations. The statement incorrectly simplifies the architectural complexity of Ajanta caves.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly lists the various deities (Buddhas, Bodhisattvas) found in Cave No. 12 at Ellora, confirming the presence of these images and their association with Vajrayana Buddhism. The detail in the statement aligns with the information presented.

2.  Sarnath sculptures of this period are characterized by heavy volume, folded drapery, and a profusely decorated halo around the Buddha's head, similar to the Mathura style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The description of Mathura sculptures during the 5th and 6th centuries CE precisely matches the characteristics mentioned in the statement.  This accurately reflects the stylistic features of Mathura sculptures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text contrasts the Sarnath style with the Mathura style, noting that Sarnath Buddha images have *plain*, transparent drapery and *little* ornamentation on the halo, unlike the profusely decorated halos of Mathura sculptures. The statement inaccurately attributes the features of Mathura sculptures to Sarnath sculptures.  This highlights the distinct stylistic differences between the two schools.


**7. With reference to the Gandhara sculptural style, consider the following statements:**

1. The Buddha head from Taxila, dating back to the 2nd century CE, exhibits Hellenistic elements like curly hair, a large forehead, and protruding eyeballs, reflecting the influence of Greco-Roman art.

1.  The Ajanta caves, primarily Buddhist, feature single, double, and triple-storied structures, with massive pillars and elaborate painted interiors (though now faded).

2. The Ellora caves showcase a remarkable diversity of religious styles, including Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain, with Cave 16 (Kailashnath Temple) being a monolithic rock-cut temple carved from a single rock.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the key features of the Ajanta caves, emphasizing their size, the variety of storey structures, the massive pillars, and the once-vibrant painted interiors, now largely lost to time.  This tests factual recall and understanding of architectural features.  The mention of the faded paintings introduces a detail that is not immediately obvious, increasing the difficulty.

1. The Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola, commissioned by Camundaraya, is the world's tallest monolithic free-standing structure, showcasing intricate carvings despite being made of granite.

2.  Jain temples at Mount Abu, built by Vimal Shah, are characterized by a simplistic exterior and exuberant marble interiors, with rich sculptural decoration creating a lace-like appearance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Gomateshwara statue, correctly identifying its status as the world's tallest monolithic free-standing structure, its commissioner (Camundaraya), and the material (granite). The apparent contradiction between intricate carvings and the hardness of granite serves as a subtle distractor, testing detailed knowledge.

Statement 2 correctly describes the Jain temples at Mount Abu, highlighting the contrast between their simplistic exteriors and elaborately carved marble interiors, creating a “lace-like” effect. The attribution to Vimal Shah adds specificity. This tests knowledge of specific sites and their architectural styles.

1.  Ajanta caves are known for their unique triple-storied excavations, a feature not replicated in Ellora.
2.  The Brahmanical caves at Ellora, specifically Cave No. 14, are distinguished by their double-storied structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ajanta does feature double-storied caves,  Ellora boasts the unique achievement of triple-storied cave excavations.  The statement incorrectly reverses this fact.  The text explicitly states that the triple-storeyed cave is a unique achievement of Ellora, implying Ajanta does not possess this specific architectural feature to the same extent.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly identifies Cave No. 14 at Ellora as the only double-storied cave associated with the Brahmanical faith. This highlights a key difference in architectural styles between Buddhist and Brahmanical cave temples at the site.  The statement accurately reflects this information.

Option (b) is therefore the only accurate choice, as it correctly identifies statement 2 as the only true statement regarding the architectural features described in the provided text. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the relationship between the architectural styles and features of Ajanta and Ellora caves.


**2. With reference to the sculptural styles of Ellora caves, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Shaivite caves at Ellora primarily depict Shiva, excluding depictions of Vishnu and other deities.
2.  The sculptures at Ellora demonstrate a homogeneity in style, reflecting a unified artistic vision.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the Brahmanical cave sculptures at Ellora depict "images of both Shiva and Vishnu and their various forms according to Puranic narrative."  This directly contradicts the statement's claim of exclusivity for Shiva. The diversity of religious themes is a crucial aspect of Ellora's artistic significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage emphasizes the diversity of Ellora's sculptural styles, stating that various guilds from different regions (Vidarbha, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu) contributed to the carvings. This resulted in a diverse range of styles, negating the claim of a unified artistic vision. The text highlights Ellora as "the most diverse site in India in terms of the sculptural styles."


Option (d) is the correct answer because both statements misrepresent the facts presented about the sculptural styles and religious themes depicted in the Ellora caves. The diversity of styles and the inclusion of both Shaivite and Vaishnavite themes are key features of the site.


**3. With reference to the features of Mahayana Buddhism, consider the following statements:**

1. The deification of the Buddha is a central tenet of Mahayana Buddhism, contrasting with the Theravada tradition.
2. The practice of image worship and rituals is absent in Mahayana Buddhism, emphasizing meditation and scripture.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage mentions "Deification of the Buddha" as a feature of Mahayana Buddhism. This is a key distinguishing feature from Theravada Buddhism, which generally avoids the deification of the Buddha.  The inclusion of Buddha images in the description of the caves supports this point.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that "Image worship and rituals" are features of Mahayana Buddhism. The presence of Buddha images and the mention of specific deities (Tara, Avalokiteshwara, etc.) in the caves at Ellora directly contradict this statement.


Option (a) is correct as it accurately identifies only statement 1 as a true description of a feature of Mahayana Buddhism.  The other options misrepresent the role of image worship and rituals within Mahayana Buddhist practice.


**4. With reference to the  rock-cut cave traditions of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The rock-cut cave tradition was primarily confined to western India, with minimal presence in other regions.
2.  The earliest examples of Jain rock-cut caves are found at Udaigiri-Khandagiri near Bhubaneswar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions the presence of rock-cut caves in various regions, including western India, eastern India (Andhra Pradesh and Odisha), and the Deccan.  The description of caves in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu refutes the claim of confinement to western India.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly identifies the Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves near Bhubaneswar as the earliest examples of Jain rock-cut caves, citing inscriptions of Kharavela kings as evidence. This accurately reflects the information provided.


Option (b) is the correct answer because it correctly identifies statement 2 as true while statement 1 is false.  The widespread nature of the rock-cut cave tradition in India is a significant point to remember.

2. The Chola period in Tamil Nadu is renowned for its bronze sculptures, particularly the Nataraja images.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the passage does state that the lost-wax process was used extensively in South India during the medieval period for bronze casting, it also mentions that the technique was known as far back as the Indus Valley Civilization and was also used in other regions of India like Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. The statement oversimplifies the geographical reach of this technique.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly highlights the Chola period in Tamil Nadu (10th-12th centuries) as a time of exceptional bronze casting, specifically mentioning the exquisite Nataraja sculptures.  The description of Chola bronzes and their popularity further reinforces this fact.

Therefore, (c) is the most accurate option as it correctly identifies statement 2 and partially statement 1 as reflecting aspects of Indian bronze sculpture traditions.  Although statement 1 is not fully correct, it contains a partially true element that the lost-wax technique was used extensively in South India during the medieval period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly distinguishes between the Nagara and Dravida styles, noting that the Nagara style features a curving shikhara, while the Dravida style has a pyramidal vimana.  The statement incorrectly equates the two distinct architectural features.

Statement 2 is correct. The text describes the evolution of Hindu temple architecture, starting with a simple garbhagriha and then progressing to include a mandapa and a shikhara/vimana in later periods. This accurately reflects the developmental stages described in the provided text.  This is a key aspect of understanding the chronology of temple architecture.

Option (b) is the correct answer, as it identifies only statement 2 as accurately reflecting the stages of development in Hindu temple architecture.  The other options incorrectly describe the characteristics of Nagara and Dravida temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage describes the Badami cave paintings as an "extension of the tradition of mural painting from Ajanta," highlighting stylistic similarities rather than a complete break.  While there are regional variations, the link to the Ajanta style is explicitly mentioned.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Nayaka paintings were "more or less an extension of the Vijayanagara style with minor regional modifications and incorporations."  This accurately reflects the relationship between these painting styles.

Statement 1 is correct. The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu are indeed famous for their contrasting simplistic exteriors and richly carved marble interiors, and were constructed under the patronage of Vimal Shah.  This exemplifies the unique architectural style blending simplicity and opulence found in some Jain temples.  The intricate sculptural decoration with deep undercutting creates a lace-like appearance, a distinctive characteristic of Dilwara architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bihar does house significant early Jain pilgrimage sites,  the assertion that the *oldest* sites are *exclusively* located there and are *renowned* primarily for early Buddhist shrines is inaccurate.  Jain pilgrimage sites are spread across India, including significant locations in Karnataka (Sravana Belagola), Gujarat (Shatrunjay hills near Palitana), Rajasthan, and the Deccan (Ellora and Aihole).  Many of these sites may have early Buddhist shrines alongside Jain structures, reflecting the historical overlap and interaction between these religions, but the statement incorrectly implies a primary association with Buddhism for the oldest Jain sites. The diversity of locations and the simultaneous presence of both Jain and Buddhist structures highlights the complex religious landscape of ancient India.


**2. With reference to Chola bronze sculptures, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chola bronzes, particularly those from the tenth to twelfth centuries, are renowned for their exquisite beauty and aesthetic appeal and are sought after by collectors worldwide.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mathura school of sculpture during the Kushana period (1st-3rd centuries CE) is indeed known for its distinctive style.  The sculptures often feature figures with a relatively light volume, fleshy bodies, and broad shoulders.  The depiction of the Buddha seated on a lion throne is a common motif within this school. These stylistic features, reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences, differentiate Mathura sculptures from those of other contemporaneous schools. The emphasis on a more naturalistic representation of the human form, with attention to details like musculature and drapery, is a key aspect of the Mathura style.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Gandhara school (primarily located in present-day Pakistan) did exhibit Greco-Roman influences, its sculptural style differs significantly from the Mathura school.  Gandhara sculptures, while sometimes depicting the Buddha, typically show less emphasis on fleshy features and tend towards a more linear and less rounded representation of the body.  The faces are often less round and the overall aesthetic is distinct from the more robust and fleshy style of the Mathura school. The distinct stylistic differences between the two schools reflect the varied cultural and artistic influences present in different regions of ancient India.

This reflects the evolution of Buddhist iconography and artistic representation. Statement 2 is also correct, as early Buddhist art, before the widespread acceptance of representing the Buddha in human form, relied heavily on symbolic representations of his presence and teachings.  These symbols served as powerful visual cues for devotees and conveyed essential Buddhist concepts. Footprints represented the Buddha's earthly journey, stupas symbolized his enlightenment and relics, and the Dharmachakra symbolized his teachings. The combination of symbolic and later anthropomorphic representations illustrates the evolving visual language of Buddhism. Options (a), (b), and (d) are thus incorrect, as both statements are historically accurate.

**1. With reference to Medieval Indian Temple Architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *rekha-prasada* style, characterized by a tall, curvilinear *shikhara*, is primarily associated with North Indian temples, while the *dravida* style, featuring a stepped pyramid-like *vimana*, is predominantly found in South India.
2.  The *panchayatana* style, featuring a central shrine surrounded by four smaller shrines, is a unique architectural feature of Odisha temples, showcasing the region's distinct approach to temple design.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The *rekha-prasada* (also known as *latina*) style, with its tall, curving *shikhara*, is indeed a hallmark of North Indian temple architecture, exemplified by temples in regions like Khajuraho and Deogarh.  Conversely, the *dravida* style, characterized by its stepped pyramid-like *vimana*, is a prominent feature of South Indian temple architecture, as seen in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.  The distinct styles reflect regional variations in building materials, techniques, and artistic sensibilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The *panchayatana* style, while present in some North Indian temples, is not uniquely associated with Odisha.  It's a broader architectural plan found across various regions, featuring a central shrine surrounded by four subsidiary shrines, symbolizing the five elements or deities.  Odisha temples do exhibit unique features within the *nagara* order (to which *panchayatana* temples often belong), but the *panchayatana* plan itself isn't exclusive to the region.  The statement incorrectly links a broader architectural principle to a specific regional style.  The presence of *panchayatana* plans in other parts of North India demonstrates its wider application.


**2. With reference to Bronze Sculpture in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "lost-wax" (cire-perdu) casting technique, prevalent in the creation of Chola bronzes, involved the use of a single mould for each sculpture, ensuring uniformity in the final product.
2.  The Chola period (10th-12th centuries CE) in Tamil Nadu is renowned for its exquisite bronze sculptures, particularly the iconic *Nataraja* depictions of Shiva, showcasing a high degree of technical skill and artistic refinement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "lost-wax" technique, while crucial to Chola bronze casting, did *not* involve a single mold for each sculpture.  The process involved creating a wax model, covering it in clay, melting out the wax, and pouring molten bronze into the resulting mold.  This was a complex, multi-step process, and each sculpture required its own individually created mold, allowing for intricate details and variations. The statement mistakenly implies a simplified, mass-production approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chola period is indeed famous for its exceptionally refined bronze sculptures, particularly the iconic *Nataraja* (Shiva as the cosmic dancer) images. These sculptures showcase a mastery of the lost-wax technique, resulting in an unparalleled level of detail, fluidity of form, and aesthetic appeal. The technical skill and artistic vision of Chola artisans elevated bronze casting to a new level of sophistication, making their works highly sought-after and influential.  The statement accurately reflects the artistic significance of the Chola period.


**3. With reference to the Pala and Sena styles of art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pala style, flourishing in Bengal and Bihar from the 9th to the 11th centuries CE, is characterized by its distinctly South Indian architectural influences, particularly evident in the *shikhara* designs of its temples.
2. The Sena style, succeeding the Pala style in Bengal from the mid-11th to mid-13th centuries CE, showed a marked departure from the Pala style, adopting a more austere and minimalist aesthetic in both sculpture and architecture.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Pala style, while influenced by various traditions, isn't primarily characterized by South Indian architectural influences. While there might be some stylistic crossovers, the Pala style developed its own distinct characteristics, often showing similarities to contemporary styles in Odisha and other parts of North India. The *shikharas* of Pala temples, while exhibiting variations, generally followed the *nagara* style, which is distinctly North Indian. The statement wrongly attributes a significant South Indian influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sena style, while exhibiting some differences from the Pala style, didn't entirely adopt a minimalist approach.  While there might have been some stylistic shifts, the Sena style continued many of the established artistic conventions of the Pala period, maintaining a degree of decorative richness and complexity in both its sculpture and architecture.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate portrayal of the Sena style's aesthetic.  Both styles show continuity and evolution within the broader context of Bengal's artistic landscape.


**4. With reference to the features of the Sun Temple at Konark, consider the following statements:**

1.  The temple's *shikhara*, originally a colossal structure, was designed to align perfectly with the sun's rays at the solstices, creating a spectacular display of light and shadow.
2.  The extensive carvings adorning the temple's walls depict a variety of mythological scenes and figures, but notably exclude any representations of the Sun God Surya himself.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the precise alignment with solstices might be debated among scholars, the massive *shikhara* of the Konark Sun Temple was indeed a key element of its design, and its orientation played a significant role in the temple's astronomical and symbolic significance. The temple's design was meticulously planned to interact with the sun's movement, creating a powerful visual spectacle at certain times of the year.  The statement accurately highlights the temple's astronomical aspects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Konark Sun Temple is renowned for its extensive and detailed carvings, and these carvings *do* include prominent representations of the Sun God Surya, often depicted in his chariot, reflecting the temple's dedication to the deity. The statement wrongly claims the absence of Surya's depiction, a central theme of the temple's iconography. The statement misrepresents a crucial aspect of the temple's iconographic program.


**5. With reference to the Hoysala temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. Hoysala temples, predominantly found in Karnataka, are characterized by their unique stellate (star-like) ground plans, a feature rarely seen in other medieval Indian temple styles.
2. The Hoysala style is easily classified as either purely *nagara* or *dravida*, reflecting a clear adherence to one of the two major temple architectural traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Hoysala temples of Karnataka are indeed distinguished by their complex and elaborate stellate (star-shaped) ground plans, a unique feature that sets them apart from other medieval Indian temple styles.  This distinctive plan, achieved through the intricate arrangement of projecting angles and shrines, is a hallmark of Hoysala architecture and reflects their sophisticated architectural skills. The statement accurately captures a key feature of Hoysala temple design.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hoysala style is often described as a *vesara* style, representing a blend or hybrid of *nagara* and *dravida* features. It doesn't neatly fit into either category, showcasing a distinct synthesis of architectural elements from different traditions.  The statement incorrectly suggests a clear-cut classification, ignoring the hybrid nature of the Hoysala style.  The unique blend of styles is a defining characteristic of Hoysala temple architecture.


**6. With reference to the Ajanta cave paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. The paintings primarily depict scenes from the life of the Buddha and Jataka tales, showcasing a sophisticated narrative style and remarkable artistic skill.
2. The Ajanta caves, known for their rich mural paintings, also contain significant examples of sculptural art, including large-scale, three-dimensional figures of Buddhist deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ajanta cave paintings are indeed renowned for their depiction of scenes from the life of the Buddha and Jataka tales (stories of Buddha's previous lives). These paintings exemplify a high level of artistic skill, demonstrating a mastery of narrative composition, figure rendering, and the use of color and line. The statement accurately reflects the primary subject matter and artistic significance of the Ajanta paintings.

Statement 2 is also correct. While primarily known for their paintings, the Ajanta caves also feature significant examples of sculptural art.  These sculptures, often integrated into the architectural fabric of the caves, include large-scale three-dimensional figures of Buddhist deities and other important figures.  The statement accurately notes the presence of sculptural elements within the Ajanta cave complex.  The interplay between painting and sculpture enhances the artistic richness of the site.


**7. With reference to the features of Buddhist monasteries in ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda University, a prominent Buddhist monastic university, was primarily known for its focus on the Theravada school of Buddhism, excluding other Buddhist traditions.
2.  The monastic complexes, such as Nalanda, served not only as centers of learning but also as significant centers for artistic production, with sculptures and illustrated manuscripts produced within their walls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Nalanda University was a major center of Buddhist learning, but it was *not* exclusively focused on the Theravada school.  It was known for its inclusivity, encompassing various Buddhist traditions, including Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. The statement wrongly restricts Nalanda's scope to a single Buddhist school.  The diversity of Buddhist thought at Nalanda is well-documented.

Statement 2 is correct.  Buddhist monasteries, including Nalanda, were indeed important centers of artistic production.  The monasteries supported workshops and artisans who created sculptures, illustrated manuscripts, and other art forms, contributing significantly to the development and dissemination of Buddhist art. The statement accurately highlights the multifaceted role of Buddhist monasteries as both educational and artistic centers.  The creation of art within the monasteries contributed to the spread of Buddhist ideas and aesthetics.

2.  The Mathura school's sculptures, primarily depicting Buddhist and Brahmanical deities, show a clear and consistent adherence to the Amaravati style prevalent in South India during the same period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mathura school of art, particularly during the Kushana period, did develop a unique style. While variations exist,  a general characteristic is the depiction of figures that are not slender and elongated but rather robust and fleshy. The emphasis is on the volume and three-dimensionality of the figures, rather than delicate details. The statement inaccurately describes the stylistic features.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Mathura school did depict both Buddhist and Brahmanical deities, it did *not* consistently adhere to the Amaravati style. The Mathura style developed its own distinct characteristics, showing influences from various traditions but maintaining a unique identity separate from the Amaravati style, which was prevalent in Andhra Pradesh. The statement incorrectly links the Mathura style to a geographically distant and stylistically different school.  The Mathura school developed its own distinct artistic language.


**9. With reference to the rock-cut architecture of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Barabar Caves in Bihar, dating back to the Mauryan period, are notable for their use of a unique rock-cut technique that resulted in smooth, polished interiors, unlike the rougher surfaces found in later rock-cut structures.
2.  The Ellora caves, featuring Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain cave temples, showcase a consistent and unified architectural style, reflecting a shared artistic vision across different religious traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Barabar Caves, constructed during the Mauryan period, are indeed remarkable for their sophisticated rock-cutting technique. The interiors are exceptionally smooth and polished, a testament to the advanced skills of the Mauryan artisans. This high level of finish contrasts with the often rougher surfaces found in later rock-cut caves.  The statement correctly highlights a unique feature of Mauryan rock-cut architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ellora caves, while showcasing a remarkable collection of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain cave temples, do *not* exhibit a consistent and unified architectural style.  Each cave temple reflects the distinct architectural and artistic conventions of its respective religious tradition, resulting in a diverse range of styles within the same site. The statement mistakenly implies stylistic homogeneity, overlooking the diversity of styles represented in the Ellora caves.  The juxtaposition of different styles reflects the religious pluralism of the time.


**10. With reference to the later mural traditions of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The mural paintings at Badami caves in Karnataka, dating to the 6th century CE, show a clear and direct stylistic influence of the earlier Ajanta paintings, preserving many of the same artistic conventions.
2. The Chola period (9th-13th centuries CE) in Tamil Nadu saw a significant decline in the tradition of mural painting, with very few surviving examples from this era compared to the prolific output of earlier periods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Badami cave paintings do exhibit a clear connection to the Ajanta tradition, showcasing stylistic similarities in terms of figure rendering, color palettes, and narrative approaches. While developing its own regional characteristics, the Badami style demonstrates a continuity with the earlier Ajanta tradition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the survival rate of Chola period mural paintings is lower than some earlier periods due to the perishable nature of the medium, it's inaccurate to say there was a significant *decline* in the tradition.  Chola-period paintings exist, though less extensively than some earlier styles, showcasing the continuing artistic practice. The statement presents an overly pessimistic assessment of the survival and continuation of the mural painting tradition. The scarcity of surviving examples is due to factors such as environmental damage and the inherent fragility of mural paintings, rather than a complete decline in the artistic practice.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember, the difficulty is designed to challenge even well-prepared candidates.


**1. With reference to Medieval Indian Temple Architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *rekha-prasada* style, characterized by a tall, curvilinear *shikhara*, is primarily associated with South Indian temples, while the *phamsana* style, with its broader, shorter structure, is predominantly found in North India.
2.  The *gopuram*, a towering gateway, is a characteristic feature of Dravida temples, while the *amalaka* and *kalasha*, crowning elements of the *shikhara*, are typically found in Nagara temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The *rekha-prasada* style, with its tall, curving *shikhara*, is a defining feature of *Nagara* temple architecture, primarily found in North India.  The *phamsana* style, with its broader and shorter structure, is also a *Nagara* subtype, often used for *mandapas* (assembly halls) in conjunction with *latina* (another *Nagara* subtype) *garbhagrihas* (sanctums). South Indian temples, on the other hand, are characterized by the *Dravida* style, featuring a *vimana* (tower) that resembles a stepped pyramid.  This reversal of styles in the statement creates a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The *gopuram*, a monumental gateway tower, is an integral part of *Dravida* temple complexes in South India. In contrast, the *amalaka* (a fluted disc) and *kalasha* (a vase-shaped finial) are the crowning elements of the *shikhara* in *Nagara* temples of North India.  This statement accurately reflects the key distinctions between the two architectural styles.


**2. With reference to Bronze Sculpture in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "lost-wax" (cire-perdu) casting technique, known since the Indus Valley Civilization, was primarily used for creating large-scale bronze sculptures of Hindu deities in South India during the Chola period.
2.  While Chola bronzes are renowned for their refined aesthetic appeal and technical mastery, bronze casting was also prevalent in other regions like Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, producing images with distinct stylistic features.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. The "lost-wax" technique was indeed known since the Indus Valley Civilization and continued to be used throughout the medieval period.  However, it was employed across various regions and for various purposes, not solely for large-scale Hindu sculptures in South India during the Chola period. Chola bronzes are indeed famous, but the technique's usage was widespread.  The emphasis on Chola bronzes as the *sole* large-scale application is the distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. While Chola bronzes represent a peak of refinement in bronze casting, the technique was used across India.  Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, for instance, developed their own distinct bronze casting traditions, creating images of Buddhist and Hindu deities with unique stylistic characteristics that differed from the Chola style. This correctly identifies the broader context of bronze casting in India.


**3. With reference to the Pala and Sena Styles of Sculpture in Eastern India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pala style, flourishing during the 9th-11th centuries in Bengal and Bihar, is characterized by its adherence to the strict Gupta style, with little regional variation.
2. The Sena style, which followed the Pala style (mid-11th to mid-13th centuries), showed a significant departure from the Pala style, incorporating elements of local Vanga traditions and exhibiting a more dynamic and expressive quality.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Pala style drew inspiration from the Gupta tradition, it was not a mere replication.  It evolved a distinct regional character, known as the Vanga style, blending Gupta elements with local aesthetics.  The statement's assertion of strict adherence to the Gupta style and lack of regional variation is factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sena style, succeeding the Pala style, built upon its predecessor but demonstrated a clear shift. It incorporated more local Vanga traditions, resulting in a sculptural style that was more dynamic and expressive than the often more restrained Pala style.  The description of a clear stylistic shift accurately reflects art historical scholarship.


**4. With reference to the Architectural Styles of Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The *vesara* style, a hybrid architectural style prevalent in Karnataka, is a distinct fusion of Nagara and Dravida elements, clearly distinguishable from both parent styles.
2. The Indo-Islamic architectural style, exemplified by structures like mosques and tombs, primarily incorporated Persian and Turkish elements, with minimal influence from pre-existing Indian architectural traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

1. The Kailashnath Temple, a monolithic rock-cut structure, represents a culmination of Dravidian architectural principles, showcasing a *vimana* (tower) and a *gopuram* (gateway) similar to those found in South Indian temples.
2. The temple's extensive sculptural program features primarily Shaiva themes, with depictions of Shiva and his various forms, but excludes any Vaishnava or other religious imagery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kailashnath Temple at Ellora is a remarkable example of monolithic rock-cut architecture.  While it is primarily associated with Dravidian architectural principles due to its *vimana* and the overall structure,  it also incorporates elements from other styles. The presence of a *gopuram*-like gateway further strengthens its connection to South Indian temple architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The temple's sculptural program is rich and diverse, featuring not only Shaiva themes but also incorporating other religious imagery, reflecting the syncretic nature of religious practices in the region during that period.  The statement's exclusion of other religious imagery is inaccurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The passage clearly contrasts the Dravida and nagara styles, highlighting the Dravida style’s defining features: the stepped pyramidal vimana, the enclosing compound wall, and the central gopuram. This comparison demonstrates a clear understanding of the fundamental differences between the two major temple architectural styles of India. The description highlights key visual features and spatial organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that in South Indian temples, "shikhara" refers only to the crowning element at the top of the vimana, equivalent to the amlaka and kalasha of North Indian temples.
