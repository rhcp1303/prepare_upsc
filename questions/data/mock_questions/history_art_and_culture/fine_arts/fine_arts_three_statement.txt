Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect;  Mathura Buddha images during the Gupta period continued to depict folds in the drapery, while Sarnath Buddha images had the plain, transparent drapery. Statement 2 is incorrect; the early phase of the Amaravati stupa lacks Buddha images, which appear later. Statement 3 correctly describes the sculptural style of Nagarjunkonda and Goli. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and demanding accurate recall of specific details.


**1. With reference to Chola bronze sculptures, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola queen Sembiyan Maha Devi was a significant patron of bronze casting during the 10th century.
2.  Chola bronzes primarily depict Buddhist deities, showcasing a distinct departure from earlier sculptural traditions.
3.  The "lost-wax" technique, though used in Chola bronze casting, was not a prevalent method in earlier Indian bronze-making traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Sembiyan Maha Devi, a widowed Chola queen, is known for her patronage of bronze casting during the 10th century, a period of flourishing bronze sculpture in the Chola dynasty.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Chola bronzes are renowned for their exquisite craftsmanship, they primarily depict Hindu deities, particularly Shiva in various forms (like Nataraja), Vishnu, and their consorts.  The Chola period saw a continuation and refinement of existing bronze-casting techniques, rather than a sudden shift to Buddhist iconography.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The "lost-wax" technique, also known as the cire-perdu process, has a long history in India, dating back to at least the Indus Valley Civilization.  Its use in Chola bronze casting represents a continuation of this ancient technique, not a novel introduction.  This technique was used in various periods and regions throughout India for bronze sculptures.



**2. With reference to Jain temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu, known for their exuberant marble interiors, were constructed by Vimal Shah.
2.  The tallest monolithic free-standing structure in the world, the Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola, was commissioned by a Ganga king of Mysore.
3.  Jain temple building was primarily confined to Gujarat and Rajasthan, with minimal presence in other parts of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu, renowned for their intricate marble carvings and contrasting simplistic exteriors, were indeed commissioned by Vimal Shah.

Statement 2 is partially correct, but misleading. While the Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola was indeed commissioned by Camundaraya, he was the General-in-Chief and Prime Minister under the Ganga Kings of Mysore, not a Ganga king himself.  This subtle distinction makes the statement factually inaccurate in the context of a strict interpretation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Gujarat and Rajasthan were indeed strongholds of Jainism, the text explicitly states that Jain sacred shrines and pilgrimage spots are found "across the length and breadth of India except in the hills," demonstrating a wider geographical spread than the statement suggests.  The statement incorrectly limits the geographical extent of Jain temples.


**3.  With reference to the rock-cut cave architecture of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Elephanta Caves, initially a Buddhist site, later became predominantly associated with Shaivite faith and are contemporary with Ellora.
2.  The Buddhist caves at Ajanta are chronologically well-defined due to the presence of numerous dated inscriptions within the caves.
3.  The Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves near Bhubaneswar, associated with Kharavela inscriptions, are primarily Buddhist in origin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Elephanta Caves near Mumbai, initially used by Buddhists, later became a prominent Shaivite site, and their sculptural style shows similarities to those found at Ellora, indicating a contemporary timeframe.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions the lack of precisely dated inscriptions at Ajanta, making chronological determination difficult. The statement contradicts this information.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that the inscriptions at Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves indicate their association with Jain monks, not Buddhists.  The statement misattributes the religious affiliation of the cave complex.

1.  Mathura sculptures of the Kushana period are characterized by round, smiling faces and a reduction in heaviness of sculptural volume compared to earlier styles.
2.  The Sarnath school of sculpture, prominent in the late fifth century CE, is known for its Buddha images with plain, transparent drapery covering both shoulders.
3.  Gandhara sculptures, with their Greco-Roman influences, primarily depict Buddhist themes while showing a departure from the stylistic conventions of other regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. While Mathura sculptures of the Kushana period do feature round faces and a move toward less heaviness, the statement oversimplifies the stylistic characteristics.  The description of "smiling faces" and "reduction in heaviness" is not entirely accurate for all Kushana sculptures in Mathura.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Sarnath school of sculpture, prominent in the late Gupta period, is indeed characterized by Buddha images with plain, transparent drapery, creating a sense of lightness and serenity that contrasts with earlier styles.

Statement 3 is correct. Gandhara sculptures, located in the northwest region (present-day Pakistan), uniquely blend Greco-Roman elements with Buddhist iconography, creating a distinct style that differs from those found in other parts of India.


**5. With reference to the architectural styles of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1. The "vesara" style of temple architecture, exemplified by Hoysala temples, is a distinct hybrid style combining Dravida and Nagara elements.
2.  The Vijayanagara architectural style, though fundamentally Dravidian, incorporated Islamic influences from neighboring sultanates.
3.  The Pala style of temple architecture, prevalent in Bengal and Bihar, is characterized by tall, sharply curving shikharas, similar to those found in Odisha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Hoysala temples, with their unique star-shaped ground plans and intricate carvings, represent the "vesara" style, a distinct hybrid of Dravida and Nagara architectural features.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vijayanagara architectural style, prominent in South India, showcases a synthesis of Dravidian temple architecture with influences from the neighboring Islamic sultanates, resulting in a unique blend of styles.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Pala style did influence temple architecture in Bengal and Bihar, it is described as having tall *curving* shikharas, not sharply curving ones as seen in Odisha.  The statement conflates stylistic features. The description is not entirely accurate for all Pala temples.


**1. With reference to Mauryan art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lion Capital at Sarnath, featuring four addorsed lions, originally included a crowning Dharmachakra (wheel), now displayed separately.
2.  Mauryan pillars, unlike Achaemenian pillars, were rock-cut monoliths, showcasing advanced carving techniques.
3. Monumental Yaksha and Yakshini statues, characterized by polished surfaces and detailed physiognomic features, were prevalent across the Mauryan empire, reflecting the popularity of Yaksha worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Mauryan art and architecture. The Sarnath Lion Capital is indeed a prime example of Mauryan sculptural skill, and its original design included a Dharmachakra, which is now displayed separately.  The text explicitly contrasts Mauryan rock-cut pillars with the constructed Achaemenian pillars, highlighting the superior carving techniques employed by Mauryan artisans.  Finally, the widespread presence of monumental Yaksha and Yakshini statues across the empire, as described in the passage, underscores the significance of Yaksha worship during that period and its integration into Buddhist and Jain religious art.  There is no contradictory information present within the provided text to refute any of these statements.


**2. With reference to Buddhist art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest evidence of stupas, built over the relics of the Buddha, is found exclusively within the Gangetic valley.
2.  The Amaravati stupa, initially constructed in the third century BCE, saw its most significant development during the first and second centuries CE, featuring narrative sculptures and, later, Buddha images.
3.  The construction of stupas and viharas was primarily driven by royal patronage, with limited contributions from lay devotees and guilds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate. The text explicitly states that the Amaravati stupa’s major development occurred in the first and second centuries CE, involving the addition of narrative sculptures and Buddha images in later phases. Statement 1 is incorrect because the text mentions stupas outside the Gangetic valley, such as those in Avanti and Gandhara. Statement 3 is false because the text explicitly notes the collective nature of patronage, including contributions from lay devotees and guilds, alongside instances of royal support. The emphasis is on the widespread nature of patronage, not its exclusive focus on royalty.


**3. With reference to the sculptural traditions of ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mathura sculptures of the Kushana period are characterized by round, fleshy figures with a pronounced bulge in the belly, while the Sarnath school of the Gupta period favored slender, well-proportioned figures with transparent drapery.
2.  The Didarganj Yakshini, a life-size standing sculpture from Patna, is known for its polished sandstone surface and the detailed rendering of the human physique.
3.  Gandhara sculptures, influenced by Greco-Roman styles, feature Buddha images with round faces and fleshy cheeks, similar to the Mathura style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of distinct sculptural styles. The text contrasts the Kushana-period Mathura style (fleshy, round figures) with the later Gupta-period Sarnath style (slender, transparent drapery). The description of the Didarganj Yakshini aligns perfectly with the textual account.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Gandhara sculptures did indeed show Greco-Roman influence, the text describes Gandhara Buddha heads as having a large forehead plane, protruding eyeballs, and a face that is not round like those from Mathura.  The stylistic differences between Gandhara and Mathura are explicitly highlighted in the source material.


**4. With reference to early Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The latina or rekha-prasada type of shikhara is a common feature in nagara-style temples, characterized by a square base and inward-curving walls rising to a point.
2.  The panchayatana style of temple architecture, exemplified by the Deogarh temple, features a central shrine surrounded by four smaller subsidiary shrines.
3.  Dravida-style temples, unlike nagara-style temples, are typically enclosed within a compound wall and feature a stepped pyramid-shaped vimana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct and represent key features of early Indian temple architecture. The description of the latina/rekha-prasada shikhara accurately reflects the text's explanation of nagara temple design. The panchayatana style, with its central and four subsidiary shrines, is correctly identified and linked to the Deogarh temple as an example.  The text clearly differentiates between nagara and dravida styles, accurately describing the compound wall and stepped pyramid vimana of dravida temples.  The descriptions accurately reflect the architectural features described in the provided text.


**5. With reference to the rock-cut cave traditions of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ajanta caves, primarily Buddhist, feature multi-storied structures with massive pillars, while Ellora caves include both Buddhist and Brahmanical caves, with Ellora uniquely showcasing triple-storied excavations.
2.  The Elephanta caves, initially Buddhist, later became predominantly Shaivite, and their sculptures are characterized by slender figures and stark light-and-dark effects.
3.  The Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves in Odisha, associated with Kharavela inscriptions, are primarily Buddhist, featuring single-cell excavations and some carved in the shape of animals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the Ajanta and Elephanta caves.  The text correctly describes the architectural features of Ajanta (multi-storied, massive pillars) and Ellora (Buddhist and Brahmanical caves, triple-storied). The description of Elephanta's transition from Buddhist to Shaivite dominance and its sculptural style is also consistent with the source.  Statement 3 is incorrect as the text clarifies that the Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves were intended for Jain monks, not Buddhist.  The other details within statement 3 are accurate for the Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves, making it a partially correct statement which is not the same as completely correct.


**6. With reference to bronze sculpture in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Dancing Girl" from Mohenjo-daro is considered the earliest known bronze sculpture in India, dating back to 2500 BCE, showcasing simplified tubular forms.

3.  Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir produced bronze images primarily during the 12th-14th centuries, characterized by a distinct style different from other regions, including depictions of four-headed Vishnu (Chaturanana).

Which of the following statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the information provided in the text about early bronze sculptures in India.  The "Dancing Girl" from Mohenjo-daro is mentioned as an early example, and the description of Gupta and post-Gupta period bronzes in North India aligns with the textual account. Statement 3 is inaccurate; the text specifies that Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir bronze production was prominent during the 8th-10th centuries, not the 12th-14th centuries.  While four-headed Vishnu is mentioned, the time period is incorrect, making the entire statement false.


**7. With reference to the prehistoric rock paintings of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The earliest discovered rock paintings in India were found in Bhimbetka, Madhya Pradesh, predating the discovery of Altamira in Spain.
2.  Bhimbetka rock paintings span multiple periods, including Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Chalcolithic, showcasing diverse themes from daily life to sacred imagery.
3.  Lakhudiyar, Uttarakhand, features rock paintings primarily in red ochre, depicting humans in naturalistic forms and a wide range of animals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely correct.  The text details the various periods and themes represented in the Bhimbetka rock paintings. Statement 1 is incorrect; the text explicitly states that the first discovery of rock paintings in India predated the discovery of Altamira, but it was not in Bhimbetka. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while Lakhudiyar does have paintings, the text mentions that they are in white, black, and red ochre, and humans are represented in stick-like forms, not naturalistically.  The other details in statement 3 are partially correct but not completely accurate, making the statement as a whole incorrect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pala style is named after the Pala dynasty, not the Sena dynasty. The Sena dynasty's architectural style followed the Pala style.  Statement 2 is correct. The Ahom style in Assam is a distinct regional style that developed from a blend of Tai influences and the pre-existing Pala style of Bengal.  Statement 3 is also correct. Odisha's temple architecture is uniquely categorized into three orders (rekhapida, pidhadeul, khakra), and the deul's characteristic inward curve near the apex, preceding the jagamohana, is a defining feature.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**2. With reference to the characteristics of  temple architecture in different regions of India, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key features of temple architecture in different regions.  Hoysala temples are indeed known for their stellate plans, intricate soapstone carvings, and the Vesara style. The Sun Temple at Konark's original colossal size, chariot-like form, and detailed carvings are well-documented. Finally, the description of Kashmiri temple architecture, particularly the Pandrethan temple's features (peaked roof, plinth in a tank), reflects the region's unique adaptations.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.

All three statements accurately describe aspects of prehistoric rock paintings in India.  The Bhimbetka paintings' classification, the discovery by Wakankar, and the characteristics of the Upper Palaeolithic period are correctly stated. The Lakhudiyar paintings' description, including the color sequence and motifs, is accurate. The description of the Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh paintings, their motifs, and the time periods they represent are all correct.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**1. With reference to prehistoric rock paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The first discovery of rock paintings in India predates the discovery of Altamira cave paintings in Spain.
2.  Rock paintings at Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh depict only hunting scenes and animal figures.
3.  Prehistoric rock paintings in India are exclusively found in caves used as dwelling places.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Archibald Carlleyle's discovery of rock paintings in India in 1867-68 predates the discovery of the Altamira cave paintings in Spain by twelve years. This highlights the early presence of artistic expression in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bhimbetka's rock paintings extensively feature hunting scenes and animal figures, they also showcase a wide range of themes, including daily life activities, sacred and royal imagery, dancing, music, and even honey collection.  The diversity of subjects reflects the multifaceted nature of prehistoric life.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While some Bhimbetka paintings are found in shelters where people lived, others are located in areas that don't appear to have been living spaces, suggesting potential religious or ceremonial significance. The location of paintings thus varies beyond just dwelling places. The distribution of prehistoric rock art across various geographical locations in India also supports this.



**2. With reference to the art of the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. Indus Valley seals were exclusively made of steatite and depicted only animal motifs.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While steatite was a common material for Indus Valley seals, they were also made from other materials like gold and ivory.  Furthermore, the motifs on the seals were diverse, including animals, trees, and human figures, along with the iconic Pashupati seal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indus Valley pottery was predominantly wheel-made, not hand-made. While painted ware existed, plain pottery was more common, often featuring red clay with a red or grey slip. Polychrome pottery was relatively rare.  The statement misrepresents the prevalent pottery techniques and decorative styles.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indus Valley people used a wide range of materials for ornaments, including precious metals and gemstones, but also bone and baked clay.  The diversity of materials reflects varying social strata and economic realities. The statement presents an overly simplistic and inaccurate view of their ornamentation practices.



**3. With reference to Mauryan art and religious practices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mauryan kings exclusively patronized the Brahmanical tradition, ignoring other religious movements.
2.  Worship of Yakshas and Mother Goddesses was completely absent during the Mauryan period.
3. Ashoka, the most powerful Mauryan king, actively promoted Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Mauryan empire had a strong association with Brahmanical traditions, Mauryan patronage extended to other religious and philosophical schools, including Buddhism and Jainism, reflecting a more inclusive religious policy.  The statement ignores the diversity of religious practices during the Mauryan period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The worship of Yakshas and Mother Goddesses continued during the Mauryan period alongside other religious practices. The statement overlooks the syncretic nature of religious beliefs and practices in the Mauryan period.

Statement 3 is correct.  Ashoka, after the Kalinga War, embraced Buddhism and played a crucial role in its propagation throughout his empire through edicts and the construction of stupas.  This statement correctly identifies Ashoka's significant role in promoting Buddhism.

(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Qutub Minar is primarily constructed of red and buff sandstone, with marble used in the upper stories.  The decorative elements also include inscriptions and foliated designs, beyond just geometric patterns.  The statement misrepresents the building materials and decorative features of the Qutub Minar.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Taj Mahal undoubtedly reflects the Mughal emperor's power, its construction also served as a mausoleum for Mumtaz Mahal and held significant symbolic meaning related to love, loss, and paradise. The statement provides an overly simplistic interpretation of the Taj Mahal's purpose.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Sarais were public accommodations offering temporary lodging to travelers, pilgrims, merchants, and traders of diverse backgrounds, contributing to cross-cultural interactions. The statement falsely restricts the function of Sarais to royal usage.


**5. With reference to  Mathura school of art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mathura school exclusively produced Buddhist sculptures, neglecting other religious iconography.
2.  Sculptures from the Mathura school consistently maintained a slender and delicate style throughout its history.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Mathura school of art produced sculptures of various religious traditions, including Buddhist, Shaiva, and Vaishnava deities, along with Yakshas and Yakshinis. The statement inaccurately limits the school's religious focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Mathura school initially featured slender figures, later periods saw a shift towards more robust and fleshy forms, followed by a return to a more refined and less fleshy style.  The statement fails to acknowledge the stylistic evolution of the school.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mathura school's artistic style significantly influenced other art centers in northern India, particularly Sarnath, contributing to the development of distinct regional styles while maintaining a common thread of influence.  This statement accurately reflects the school's broader impact on the artistic landscape.


**6. With reference to post-Mauryan Buddhist monuments in South India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amaravati Stupa's construction began in the first century CE and featured only Buddha images.
2.  Sculptures from Nagarjunkonda and Goli show less animated movement than those from Amaravati.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Amaravati Stupa saw significant development in the first and second centuries CE, construction activity began earlier, in the third century BCE.  Moreover, the early phase lacked Buddha images; they appeared later. The statement incorrectly states the chronology and the presence of Buddha images.

Statement 2 is correct.  Sculptures from Nagarjunkonda and Goli, compared to Amaravati, exhibit less animated movement, despite maintaining a sense of volume and form. This statement accurately reflects a stylistic shift in sculptural representation.

1. Chola bronzes exclusively depict Hindu deities.
2.  The lost-wax casting technique was not used in the creation of Chola bronzes.
3.  Chola bronze sculptures are characterized by a consistent stylistic approach without regional variations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Chola bronzes predominantly depict Hindu deities, some also portray Buddhist and Jain figures. The statement presents an overly restrictive view of the religious subjects represented in Chola bronzes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The lost-wax casting technique was a crucial method employed in the creation of Chola bronzes, demonstrating high technical skill and artistic mastery. The statement incorrectly denies the use of this technique.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A defining feature of Dravida temples is their enclosure within a compound wall, often featuring a gopuram as the entrance gateway. The statement misrepresents a fundamental characteristic of Dravida temple architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The vimana in Dravida temples is a stepped pyramid-like structure, unlike the curving shikhara of Nagara temples. The statement incorrectly describes the shape of the vimana.

Statement 3 is correct.  Fierce dvarapalas (door-keepers) are commonly found guarding the entrance to the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) in Dravida temples, adding to the temple's symbolic and protective aspects.  This statement accurately describes a common feature of Dravida temple iconography.


**10.  With reference to Jain temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The oldest Jain pilgrimage sites are exclusively located in Gujarat.
2.  The Dilwara temples in Mount Abu are known for their exuberant exterior carvings.

(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gujarat has significant Jain sites, the oldest pilgrimage sites are found in Bihar, many of which were initially associated with Buddhism. The statement presents an inaccurate geographical distribution of early Jain sites.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Dilwara temples in Mount Abu are renowned for their intricately carved marble interiors, contrasting with a relatively simpler exterior.  The statement misrepresents the location of the most elaborate carvings.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Jain temples are found in various regions of India, including hilly areas such as Mount Abu. The statement makes an inaccurate generalization about the geographical distribution of Jain temples.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and assess a range of cognitive skills, focusing on factual recall and analytical abilities.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's prior knowledge.


**1. With reference to the Ajanta Caves' sculptural panel depicting Mara's army, consider the following statements:**

1. The panel showcases Mara's army marching towards the Buddha in the upper half and departing in the lower half.
2. The dancing figures at the base, accompanied by musicians, are characterized by a forward-bulging waist and angular frontal looks.
3. Stylistic features of the Mara army's facial characteristics bear resemblance to sculptures from the region of Gujarat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the depiction of Mara's army's arrival and departure in the Ajanta panel. The division into upper and lower halves narrates the sequence of events. Statement 2 correctly identifies the stylistic features of the dancing figures – the forward-bulging waist and angular frontal looks are key characteristics mentioned in the source text. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The source text explicitly links the stylistic features of Mara's army to sculptures from Vidarbha, not Gujarat. Vidarbha is a historical region in present-day Maharashtra, geographically distinct from Gujarat.  The inclusion of Gujarat as a distractor is designed to test the examinee's precise knowledge of geographical locations associated with specific artistic styles.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correct information or include the false statement regarding Gujarat.


**2. With reference to the artistic traditions of South India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pallava king Mahendravarma I, known for his artistic patronage, is mentioned in inscriptions with titles like "Vichitrachitta" and "Chitrakarapuli".
2.  The Sittanavasal caves, showcasing paintings of celestial nymphs, are attributed to the Chola dynasty.
3. Chola paintings in the Brihadeswara temple at Thanjavur depict narratives related to Lord Shiva, including his portrayal as Tripurantaka and Nataraja.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly mentions Mahendravarma I's artistic patronage and the titles associated with him in inscriptions.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the themes depicted in Chola paintings at the Brihadeswara temple, including Shiva as Tripurantaka and Nataraja. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Sittanavasal caves with their paintings of celestial nymphs are associated with the Pandya dynasty, not the Cholas. The deliberate misattribution of the Sittanavasal caves to the Chola dynasty serves as a crucial distractor, testing the examinee's precise knowledge of South Indian artistic patronage and chronology. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the false statement about the Chola-Pandya attribution or omit correct information.


**3. With reference to early Indian sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Didarganj Yakshi, known for its polished surface and detailed rendering of the human physique, is from the Mauryan period.
2.  Mathura sculptures of the Kushana period are characterized by heavy volume and extreme fleshiness, in contrast to the later Gupta period's more refined style.
3. The Sarnath Lion Capital, a Mauryan masterpiece, features four lions seated back-to-back on a circular abacus decorated with a wheel motif and animal figures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Didarganj Yakshi and its stylistic characteristics, placing it correctly within the Mauryan period.  Statement 3 correctly depicts the Sarnath Lion Capital's components and decorative features. However, statement 2 presents a partially inaccurate description of the Kushana and Gupta periods' sculptural styles. While Kushana sculptures did exhibit fleshiness,  the statement overstates the contrast with the Gupta period, which also featured a range of styles, not all of them strictly "refined". The exaggeration in statement 2 is a deliberate attempt to create a distractor. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect either because they include the partially inaccurate statement about the Kushana and Gupta styles or because they omit accurate information.



**4. With reference to  Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The use of arches, supported by voussoirs and keystones, and domes resting on pendentives and squinches, became a characteristic feature of Indo-Islamic architecture.
2.  The Gujarat style of Indo-Islamic architecture shows a marked regional character, borrowing elements such as toranas and lintels from regional temple traditions.
3.  The Qutub Minar in Delhi is an example of the Mughal style of Indo-Islamic architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the structural innovations—the use of voussoirs, keystones, pendentives, and squinches—that were adopted and adapted in Indo-Islamic architecture. Statement 2 correctly highlights the regional variations in Indo-Islamic architecture, specifically mentioning the Gujarat style's incorporation of elements from local temple traditions. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Qutub Minar is an example of the Delhi Sultanate style, predating the Mughal period. The incorrect attribution of the Qutub Minar serves as a significant distractor. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the false statement about the Qutub Minar or omit correct information.



**5. With reference to temple architecture in Eastern India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pala style of sculpture, prevalent in Bengal and Bihar between the ninth and eleventh centuries, is characterized by tall, curving shikharas crowned by large amalakas.
2.  The Ahom style of architecture in Assam, influenced by Tai migration and the Pala style of Bengal, flourished predominantly during the seventh and eighth centuries.
3.  The Odisha temple style, classified into rekhapida, pidhadeul, and khakra orders, features deuls (shikharas) that curve sharply inwards near the top.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Pala style's characteristic features—tall, curving shikharas and large amalakas. Statement 3 correctly identifies the classification and the distinct curving feature of Odisha's deuls. However, statement 2 is incorrect regarding the chronology of the Ahom style. The Ahom style's development, influenced by Tai migration and the Pala style, is primarily associated with the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, not the seventh and eighth. The misplacement of the Ahom style's timeframe is a deliberate attempt to create a distractor.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the false statement about the Ahom style's timeframe or omit correct information.


**6. With reference to the artistic styles of the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hoysala temples, known for their stellate plans and intricate carvings, are considered a hybrid style, blending Dravida and Nagara elements.
2.  Vijayanagara architecture synthesized Dravida temple architecture with Islamic styles, as evidenced by the accounts of foreign travelers like Niccolo di Conti and Abd al-Razzaq.
3. The sculptures of the Lakṣaṇa-Devī Maṇḍir at Chamba show a blend of local traditions with a post-Gupta style, influenced by the metal sculpture tradition of Gujarat.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Hoysala temple style, highlighting its unique plan and the combination of Dravida and Nagara features. Statement 2 correctly points to the synthesis of Dravida and Islamic styles in Vijayanagara architecture and mentions the accounts of foreign travelers as evidence. However, statement 3 is incorrect in its geographical attribution. While the Lakṣaṇa-Devī Maṇḍir at Chamba does show a blend of local traditions and post-Gupta styles, it is linked to the metal sculpture tradition of Kashmir, not Gujarat. This misattribution of the influence to Gujarat is designed to mislead. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect.



**7. With reference to the development of bronze sculpture in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Dancing Girl" bronze from Mohenjo-daro is considered one of the earliest examples of bronze sculpture in India, dating back to around 2500 BCE.
2.  Chola bronze sculptures, known for their refined style and exquisite detail, were produced primarily in the region of Kumbakonam.
3.  The lost-wax process, used in bronze casting, involves creating a wax model, covering it with clay, and then pouring molten metal into the mold after firing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly reflect aspects of bronze sculpture development in India.  Statement 1 accurately identifies the "Dancing Girl" and its approximate dating. Statement 2 correctly specifies Kumbakonam as a significant center for Chola bronze production. Statement 3 accurately describes the lost-wax casting process.  There are no misleading elements or distractors in this question; all three statements are factually correct and represent key aspects of Indian bronze sculpture history.  The other options are incorrect because they omit true statements.


**8. With reference to Buddhist cave architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ajanta caves showcase examples of single, double, and triple-story excavations, with massive pillars and extensive painted interiors.
2.  Ellora caves feature a unique triple-story Brahmanical cave (Cave No. 14), while the Buddhist caves typically have Buddha images guarded by Padmapani and Vajrapani.
3.  The cave tradition extended to eastern India, with sites like Guntapalle in Andhra Pradesh featuring circular chaitya caves with stupas and pillared vihara caves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the scale and features of Ajanta caves, although it should be noted that while painted interiors existed, they are largely lost. Statement 3 correctly identifies the characteristics of the Guntapalle caves. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  While Ellora does have triple-story Buddhist caves,  it is Cave No. 16 (Kailashnath Temple) which is a monolithic rock-cut temple, not a Brahmanical cave.  The incorrect designation of the cave number is a subtle distractor, testing the examinee's detailed knowledge of Ellora's cave numbering and religious affiliations. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect.

1.  The standard Harappan seal was a circular plaque approximately 2x2 square inches, typically crafted from steatite.
2.  Indus seals depict a variety of motifs, predominantly animals like bulls, elephants, and tigers, alongside occasional human figures and trees.  Inscriptions on these seals, in a yet-undeciphered pictographic script, are consistently uniform.
3. Seals were exclusively made from soft river stones like steatite, and were primarily used as stamps for official documentation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while steatite was a common material, the standard Harappan seal was square, not circular. The dimensions are also approximately correct, but not precise.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect.  While the description of motifs is accurate, the inscriptions on the seals were not consistently uniform; they varied in each case. Statement 3 is incorrect because seals were made from materials beyond soft stones; gold and ivory examples exist.  Their function extended beyond official documentation; evidence suggests they were also used as amulets.  The accurate information is scattered across different aspects of the three statements, making none of them entirely correct.



**2. With reference to Indus Valley Civilization pottery, consider the following statements:**

1.  Indus Valley pottery primarily consisted of hand-made wares, characterized by intricate painted designs.
2.  Polychrome pottery, featuring multiple colors like red, black, and green, was a dominant feature of Indus pottery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Wheel-made pottery was far more common than hand-made pottery in the Indus Valley Civilization. While painted ware existed, plain pottery was more prevalent. Statement 2 is incorrect. Polychrome pottery was rare, not dominant, and primarily featured geometric patterns on small vases.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Perforated pottery was likely used for straining liquids, not for grain storage.  Therefore, none of the statements accurately reflect the characteristics of Indus Valley pottery.


**3. With reference to the art and artifacts of the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan people primarily adorned themselves with ornaments crafted from inexpensive materials like bone and baked clay, reflecting a simple lifestyle.
2.  Bead-making was a rudimentary craft in the Indus Valley, with beads primarily made from readily available stones like cornelian and amethyst.
3.  The discovery of numerous spindles and spindle whorls suggests that spinning and weaving were widespread practices among the Harappan people, irrespective of social class.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While bone and baked clay were used, the Harappan people also used precious metals and gemstones, indicating a diverse range of materials used in ornament-making. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Bead-making was a highly developed industry, as evidenced by specialized factories at Chanhudaro and Lothal. A wide array of materials were used, going beyond readily available stones. Statement 3 is correct. The widespread discovery of spindles and spindle whorls made from both expensive and inexpensive materials suggests that spinning and weaving were common practices across different social strata in the Indus Valley Civilization.


**4. With reference to the "Pashupati Seal" of the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pashupati seal depicts a human figure seated cross-legged, surrounded by a tiger, a rhinoceros, and a buffalo, but excluding any other animals.
2.  The central figure on the Pashupati seal is universally accepted by scholars as a representation of the male deity, Shiva.
3. The Pashupati seal, dating back to between 2500 and 1500 BCE, was found exclusively in Mohenjodaro.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the seal also includes an elephant, two antelopes, and is not limited to the animals mentioned. Statement 2 is incorrect. While some scholars identify the central figure as Pashupati (a proto-Shiva), the identification is not universally accepted; some interpret it as a female deity. Statement 3 is incorrect. While a significant number of such seals were found in Mohenjodaro, they were also discovered in other Indus Valley sites. Hence, none of the statements are entirely accurate.


**5. With reference to the "Dancing Girl" bronze statuette from Mohenjodaro, consider the following statements:**

1. The statuette is approximately twelve inches high and crafted from gold.
2. It depicts a girl with elaborate hairstyles, bangles, and a necklace, but lacks any specific dance posture.
3. The statuette's discovery is considered one of the most significant archaeological finds from the Indus Valley Civilization, showcasing the advanced bronze casting techniques of the time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statuette is approximately four inches high, not twelve, and is made of copper, not gold. Statement 2 is incorrect. The statuette clearly depicts a girl in a traditional Indian dance posture, with bangles, a bracelet, an amulet, and a necklace. Statement 3 is correct. The "Dancing Girl" statuette is indeed a significant find, highlighting the advanced metalworking skills of the Indus Valley Civilization.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

1.  The Mauryan pillars were constructed from pre-fabricated stone blocks, showcasing advanced masonry techniques.
2. The Lion Capital at Sarnath, originally comprising a wheel (Dharamchakra), four lions, and a circular abacus, is currently displayed with all its original components intact.
3.  Monumental Yaksha and Yakshini statues from the Mauryan period are characterized by a highly polished surface and detailed physiognomic features.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mauryan pillars were rock-cut, not constructed from pre-fabricated blocks. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Dharamchakra (wheel) of the Lion Capital at Sarnath is in a broken condition and is displayed separately in the site museum.  Statement 3 is correct.  Monumental Yaksha and Yakshini statues from the Mauryan period are indeed characterized by polished surfaces and detailed facial features. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.



**7. With reference to post-Mauryan sculptural traditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mathura school of sculpture, flourishing from the 1st century CE onwards, is characterized by slender figures with transparent drapery, primarily depicting Buddhist themes.
2.  The Sarnath school of sculpture, contemporaneous with Mathura, featured Buddha images with profusely decorated halos and elaborately depicted drapery folds.
3.  The Amaravati school of sculpture, known for its intense emotions and dynamic movement in figures, primarily depicted scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Mathura school did flourish from the 1st century CE onward and is known for its depictions of Buddhist figures, often with a focus on slender figures and, later, more transparent drapery. However, it also depicted other deities. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Sarnath school is more known for its simpler, less ornate style, including plain, transparent drapery on Buddha images and less ornamentation on the halos. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Amaravati school is famous for its depictions of Buddhist narratives, particularly Jataka tales and the life of the Buddha, not scenes from the epics.  Therefore, only statement 1 comes closest to being entirely correct, though with some qualifications.

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is definitively correct. Banawali is indeed located in the Ghaggar-Hakra river valley, a key region for Indus Valley Civilization settlements.  The Ghaggar-Hakra river system played a vital role in supporting the agricultural and urban development of the civilization.  Statement 2 is incorrect because while both Mohenjodaro and Lothal were major Indus Valley cities, they were not located in the same river valley.  Mohenjodaro was situated on the Indus River, while Lothal was located on a tributary of the Sabarmati River.  The geographical distribution of Indus cities highlights the civilization's spread across diverse river systems.

The Rig Veda does indeed contain detailed descriptions of Yajnas and their associated rituals, offering valuable insights into the religious practices and social structures of the Vedic period.  The Yajnas were elaborate ceremonies often involving priests and elaborate offerings, signifying their significance in Vedic society. Statement 2 is incorrect as the Sabha was a more complex institution than simply a council of ministers. It was an assembly of the people, participating in decision-making processes.  The Sabha's role varied depending on the region and political context. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Vedic system of governance was more nuanced than simply autocratic. While kings held significant power, there were also assemblies like the Sabha and Samiti that played a role in decision-making, indicating a degree of participatory governance.  The nature of governance in the Vedic era was complex and varied, not fitting neatly into a single category.

Megasthenes' accounts provide invaluable insights into Mauryan society and administration, highlighting the empire's interactions with the Hellenistic world.  His writings offer a unique foreign perspective on the Mauryan Empire. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Mauryan Empire was not isolationist and engaged extensively with foreign powers, including diplomatic relations and trade.  The empire's reach extended across a vast territory and involved considerable interaction with neighboring kingdoms and empires. Statement 3 correctly points out the significant interaction between Chandragupta Maurya's court and Greek emissaries, exemplified by Megasthenes' presence.  This interaction demonstrates the Mauryan Empire's engagement with the wider world and its place in the broader context of ancient civilizations.

Ananda's presence reflects the importance of preserving the Buddha's teachings and maintaining the unity of the Buddhist community.  Ashoka's reign was pivotal for the spread of Buddhism, but he did not personally organize any of the councils.  His patronage and support were crucial for the religion's expansion, but the councils themselves were organized by other prominent Buddhist figures. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Second Buddhist Council was not convened under the patronage of Ajatashatru.  Ajatashatru's reign predates the Second Council by several centuries.  The Second Buddhist Council was held in Vaishali, and its primary purpose was to address doctrinal disagreements.  The council's decisions and their impact on the development of Buddhism are significant for understanding the religion's evolution.


**13. With reference to the Vedic era, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sabha was an institution primarily associated with the mercantile class in villages.

Its function was multifaceted and involved various social groups, participating in local governance and decision-making.  The Sabha's role highlights the complexity of social and political structures in the Vedic period. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Vedic era's governance was not strictly republican.  While assemblies like the Sabha and Samiti played a role, kings also held significant authority, indicating a mixed system rather than a purely republican one.  The balance of power varied depending on the specific context. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Sabha was not a national assembly encompassing all the people of a state. Its scope was more localized, representing specific communities or regions.  The term 'Sabha' needs to be understood within its specific context and its varied functions within the Vedic socio-political framework.


**14. With reference to Mauryan-era municipal administration, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely correct. The Mauryan administration did indeed regulate weights and measures as part of its municipal functions, reflecting its concern for fair trade and economic stability.  Standardization of weights and measures was crucial for ensuring fair transactions and preventing fraud. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the Mauryan administration may have intervened in markets at times, systematic price control was not a consistent or primary function of municipal administration. The economy functioned with a degree of free market dynamics. Statement 3 is incorrect as registration of births and deaths, in its modern form, is a relatively recent development.  While the Mauryan administration may have collected some demographic information for taxation or other purposes, a formal system of birth and death registration comparable to modern practices did not exist then.  The comparison highlights the evolution of administrative practices across centuries.

It represents the fundamental harmony and balance in the cosmos.  The concept of Rit is central to understanding the worldview of various ancient Indian traditions. Statement 2 is incorrect; while Rit is related to religious and ritual practices, it's not a specific ritual itself.  It's a broader concept encompassing the ethical and cosmic order. Statement 3 is also incorrect; Rit is not a concept primarily associated with Jainism. It is a fundamental concept found in Hinduism and other ancient Indian traditions.  The understanding of Rit is crucial for interpreting the worldview and ethical framework of ancient Indian societies.

3.  The sabha mandapa (assembly hall) is enclosed on all sides, showcasing a style typical of western and central Indian temples of that period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate, correctly identifying the temple's location, builder, date, and the presence of the surya kund. Statement 2 is partially correct in noting the influence of Gujarat's woodcarving tradition on the temple's overall design. However, it incorrectly states that the central shrine is lavishly carved.  The text explicitly mentions that the walls of the central shrine are left plain to allow direct sunlight during the equinoxes. Statement 3 is incorrect because the sabha mandapa at Modhera is described as open on all sides, a characteristic feature of western and central Indian temples of that era. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 (with the correction noted above) are entirely correct.


**5. With reference to South Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

The candidate needs to possess precise knowledge of Khajuraho's temple details to identify the correct statements.


**5. With reference to South Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dravida temples typically feature a single, central shikhara, unlike Nagara temples which often have multiple shikharas.
2.  The gopuram, a monumental gateway tower, is a characteristic feature of Dravida temple complexes, often exceeding the height of the main vimana.
3.  The five main shapes of Dravida vimanas (towers) are square, rectangular, elliptical, circular, and octagonal, each potentially influenced by the iconographic nature of the deity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Dravida temples may have a prominent central vimana, the presence of subsidiary shrines and towers within the complex is not uncommon.  Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The gopuram is indeed a defining feature of Dravida temple complexes and often surpasses the height of the main vimana.  The five shapes mentioned for Dravida vimanas also accurately reflect the architectural diversity within the Dravida style.

1. The largest sculptural panel at Ajanta depicts the story of the Buddha's enlightenment, showing Mara's army approaching and then departing after being defeated.
2. The dancing figures depicted in the lower portion of the panel at Ajanta exhibit slender waists and elongated limbs, displaying a distinctly South Indian style.
3. The artistic styles seen in the Ajanta caves directly reflect the influence of the Vakataka school of art, with no evidence of influences from other regional styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the subject and main components of the largest sculptural panel at Ajanta.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the dancing figures depicted have forward-bulging waists, not slender ones, and the style shows a mix of influences, not a distinctly South Indian style.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Ajanta caves display a blend of artistic influences from various regional schools, not solely from the Vakataka school.

3.  The Ahom architectural style in Assam, emerging in the 12th-14th centuries, resulted from a fusion of Tai influences from Upper Burma and the dominant Pala style of Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Pala style is indeed named after the Pala dynasty, not the Sena dynasty. The Sena dynasty's architectural style followed the Pala style.  Statement 2 is correct. The Siddheshvara Mahadeva temple in Barakar exemplifies the early Pala style, characterized by tall, curving shikharas, showcasing a clear stylistic connection with contemporary Odisha temple architecture. This indicates a cross-regional influence and shared artistic vocabulary during that period. Statement 3 is also correct. The Ahom style in Assam, flourishing from the 12th to 14th centuries, is a distinct regional style. Its development is attributed to the integration of artistic traditions brought by the migrating Tai people from Upper Burma with the pre-existing and influential Pala style from Bengal. This fusion resulted in a unique architectural language that became characteristic of the Ahom kingdom's artistic output.


**2. With reference to bronze sculpture in India, consider the following statements:**

2.  Chola bronze sculptures, renowned for their exquisite detail and graceful poses, were primarily produced during the 10th-12th centuries CE in Tamil Nadu, under the patronage of Queen Sembiyan Maha Devi.
3.  The lost-wax casting technique, employed in creating many Indian bronze sculptures, involved the use of a single metal, typically copper, resulting in sculptures of uniform density and texture.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the "Dancing Girl" is an important early bronze,  it's not the earliest known example and the description of it as "highly refined and detailed" is debatable, given its stylistic features.  Statement 2 is largely correct. Chola bronzes are indeed famous for their refinement and grace and were predominantly created in Tamil Nadu during the 10th-12th centuries CE.  Queen Sembiyan Maha Devi was a significant patron of the arts during this period.  However, while she was a major patron, other Chola rulers also commissioned many important bronze works. Statement 3 is incorrect. The lost-wax casting technique, also known as the cire-perdue method, often involved the use of alloys, mixing metals like copper, zinc, and tin to create bronze. This alloying process allowed for variations in the final sculpture's density and texture.  The statement's assertion of a single metal and uniform density is inaccurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Qutub Minar, while predominantly made of red sandstone, also incorporates marble in its upper storeys.  Furthermore, its architectural style reflects a blend of indigenous and foreign influences, drawing upon both local traditions and architectural styles from the Middle East and Central Asia. Statement 2 is correct. Jama Masjids, large mosques designed for congregational Friday prayers, are a defining element of Indo-Islamic architecture. Their design commonly includes open courtyards surrounded by columned cloisters, reflecting a synthesis between indigenous architectural features and Islamic architectural principles.  Statement 3 is also correct.  The construction of impressive forts was a hallmark of the Indo-Islamic period, with structures like those at Chittor, Gwalior, and Golconda showcasing sophisticated defensive strategies.  These often involved concentric walls, staggered entrances, and the use of natural topography to maximize security.


**4. With reference to South Indian Temple Architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. Hoysala temples, characterized by their stellate plans and intricate carvings, are exclusively classified under the Dravida style of temple architecture.
2. The Virupaksha temple in Hampi showcases a synthesis of Dravida temple architecture with Islamic architectural styles, reflecting the cultural fusion of the Vijayanagara period.
3.  The main temple tower in South Indian temples, known as the vimana, is typically a stepped pyramid, contrasting with the curving shikharas found in North Indian temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Hoysala temples are indeed known for their stellate plans and intricate carvings, their style is often considered a hybrid or Vesara style, blending elements of both Dravida and Nagara styles, rather than being purely Dravida. Statement 2 is correct. The Virupaksha temple in Hampi exemplifies the Vijayanagara architectural style, which effectively combined the long-standing Dravida tradition with influences from the contemporary Islamic sultanates. This fusion is evident in the temple's design and decorative elements. Statement 3 is correct.  The vimana, the main tower of South Indian temples, is typically a stepped pyramid that rises geometrically. This contrasts sharply with the curving shikharas that characterize North Indian Nagara-style temples, representing a fundamental difference in architectural approaches between the two regions.


**5. With reference to the artistic and architectural developments of the post-Mauryan period, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Amaravati stupa, primarily developed during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, is characterized by a domical stupa structure covered with relief sculptural slabs depicting events from the life of the Buddha and Jataka tales, but it lacks any torana.
2.  Mathura, a significant center of art production in the post-Mauryan period, produced numerous Buddhist images alongside images of Vaishnava and Shaiva faiths, initially characterized by boldness in carving and a pronounced sculptural volume.
3.  The rock-cut caves of western India, dating from the 2nd century BCE onwards, primarily feature three architectural types: apsidal vault-roof chaitya halls, apsidal vault-roof pillarless halls, and flat-roofed quadrangular halls with a circular chamber at the back.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  The Amaravati stupa *did* have a torana, although it has since disappeared. The description of the stupa's other features is accurate. Statement 2 is correct. Mathura was a leading artistic center during the post-Mauryan era, producing a wide range of sculptures. These included Buddhist images along with those of Vaishnava and Shaiva deities. Early Mathura sculptures are often characterized by bold carving and a substantial sculptural volume. Statement 3 is correct. The rock-cut caves of western India, originating in the 2nd century BCE, exhibited a variety of architectural styles.  The three types mentioned—apsidal vault-roof chaitya halls, apsidal vault-roof pillarless halls, and flat-roofed quadrangular halls—represent the major architectural forms found in these cave complexes.


**6. With reference to  the art and architecture of the Mauryan period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mauryan pillars, unlike Achaemenian pillars, are monolithic rock-cut structures demonstrating exceptional carving skills.
2. The Sarnath Lion Capital, a Mauryan masterpiece, features four addorsed lions atop a circular abacus decorated with a wheel (chakra), a bull, a horse, an elephant, and a lion between each chakra.
3. The Didarganj Yakshini, a life-size sandstone sculpture, is characterized by a highly polished surface and a detailed rendering of the human form, showcasing a relaxed posture and soft, flowing drapery.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mauryan pillars are distinct from Achaemenian pillars in their construction. Mauryan pillars are carved from a single piece of rock, demonstrating advanced rock-cutting techniques, while Achaemenian pillars were typically assembled from multiple pieces. Statement 2 is largely correct but contains a minor inaccuracy.  The Sarnath Lion Capital does indeed feature four addorsed lions on a circular abacus with a wheel (chakra) and other animals. However, the description of "a bull, a horse, an elephant, and a lion between each chakra" needs clarification: there is one of each animal between each of the four wheels. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Didarganj Yakshini is known for its polished surface and detailed anatomical rendering. However, the description of its posture as "relaxed" and its drapery as "soft and flowing" is not entirely accurate. The Yakshini's posture is more upright and dignified, and the drapery, while carefully rendered, is not characterized by extreme softness or flow.


**7.  With reference to the  Vijayanagara and Nayaka painting styles, consider the following statements:**

1.  Early Vijayanagara paintings, exemplified by those at Tiruparakunram, feature figures with faces shown in profile, large frontal eyes, and narrow waists, set against a detailed and richly colored background.
2.  Nayaka paintings, primarily from the 17th and 18th centuries, continued the tradition of showing figures in profile against a flat background, but with a reduction in the heaviness of the male figures' abdomens compared to Vijayanagara style.
3.  Kerala mural paintings, while influenced by Nayaka and Vijayanagara styles, developed a unique pictorial language characterized by vibrant colors and three-dimensionality, drawing inspiration from traditions like Kathakali.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?


(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While early Vijayanagara paintings do depict figures with profile faces and large frontal eyes, the background is typically not richly detailed; it is relatively flat. Statement 2 is correct. Nayaka paintings, produced primarily during the 17th and 18th centuries, retained the profile view of figures and a flat background, but with noticeable modifications.  Male figures, in particular, exhibit a less heavy abdomen compared to their Vijayanagara counterparts. Statement 3 is correct. Kerala mural paintings, although influenced by South Indian styles like Vijayanagara and Nayaka, developed their distinct artistic language.  This is characterized by the use of vibrant, luminous colors and a greater emphasis on three-dimensionality in the portrayal of human figures, clearly influenced by performing arts like Kathakali.


**8. With reference to Jain art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola, commissioned by Camundaraya, is the world's tallest monolithic free-standing structure, carved from soapstone and exhibiting extremely detailed and intricate carvings.
2.  The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu, built by Vimal Shah, are characterized by a simple exterior and an exuberantly decorated marble interior, featuring unique ceiling patterns and graceful bracket figures.
3.  Early Jain pilgrimage sites are predominantly found in the Deccan region, with notable architectural examples located in Ellora and Aihole alongside significant Buddhist sites.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect in its material description. The Gomateshwara statue is indeed the world's tallest monolithic free-standing structure, commissioned by Camundaraya.  However, it is carved from granite, not soapstone.  The statement's description of its carvings as "extremely detailed and intricate" is accurate. Statement 2 is correct. The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu, constructed by Vimal Shah, are renowned for their stark contrast between a relatively plain exterior and the highly ornate marble interiors. This interior decoration includes unique ceiling patterns and graceful bracket figures, showcasing exceptional craftsmanship. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Jain sites exist in the Deccan (Ellora and Aihole), the earliest known significant Jain pilgrimage sites are primarily located in Bihar, many of which are also associated with early Buddhist shrines.  The statement's claim of the Deccan being the primary location for early Jain sites is inaccurate.


**1. With reference to Medieval Indian bronze sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. The "lost-wax" (cire-perdu) casting process, used extensively in bronze sculpture, originated in the Gupta period.
2.  Significant bronze sculptures of Jain Tirthankaras from the Kushana period have been discovered in Chausa, Bihar, showcasing mastery in depicting the masculine physique.
3.  The Chola bronze sculptures, renowned for their aesthetic appeal, primarily depict Buddhist deities.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions the discovery of Jain Tirthankara bronze sculptures from Chausa, Bihar, during the Kushana period, highlighting the skill of Indian sculptors in rendering masculine forms.  The description of Adinath/Vrishabhnath further supports this.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the "lost-wax" technique is ancient, tracing back to the Indus Valley Civilization, the statement incorrectly attributes its origin to the Gupta period.  The text clearly establishes its much earlier origins.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Chola bronzes are aesthetically significant, the text emphasizes their depiction of Hindu and Jain icons, not Buddhist deities.  The example of the "Kaliyadaman" bronze, a depiction of Krishna, further refutes the statement.  The focus of Chola bronze casting was largely Hindu iconography.


**2. With reference to Medieval Indian Temple Architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara style, prevalent in North India, features a pyramidal vimana, typically constructed from sandstone.
2. The Dravida style, dominant in South India, is characterized by a curvilinear shikhara and is often enclosed within a compound wall with a gopuram.
3.  The Vesara style is a distinct architectural order, completely independent of both Nagara and Dravida influences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain inaccuracies.  Statement 1 incorrectly describes the Nagara style as having a pyramidal vimana; the Nagara style is characterized by a curvilinear shikhara.  Sandstone was a common material, but not exclusive to the Nagara style. Statement 2 reverses the characteristics of Nagara and Dravida styles.  The Dravida style has a pyramidal vimana, and the Nagara style has a curvilinear shikhara.  While compound walls and gopurams are common in Dravidian architecture, this is not the defining feature.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Vesara style is often described as a hybrid style incorporating elements of both Nagara and Dravida.  It is not entirely independent.

3. The Nalanda sculptures of the 9th-12th centuries CE show a distinct regional style, completely independent of Gupta and Sarnath influences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the stylistic features of Amaravati sculptures. The text describes them as having "intense emotions," "slender figures," "a lot of movement," "tribhanga postures," and "complex overlapping."

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mathura sculptures of the period described are characterized by "fleshy bodies," not slender figures. The description highlights "light volume" and "broad shoulders."  The statement misrepresents the sculptural characteristics.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Nalanda school developed a distinct style, the text explicitly mentions its development as a synthesis of Sarnath Gupta, local Bihar, and Central Indian traditions.  It was not independent of earlier influences.


**4. Consider the following statements about the "lost-wax" process in Medieval Indian art:**

1.  The "lost-wax" process was exclusively used for creating large-scale bronze sculptures of deities.
2.  This technique was primarily practiced in South India during the Chola period.

(d) 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 correctly describes the steps involved in the lost-wax casting process. The text details the creation of a wax model, its coating with clay, wax melting, and metal pouring.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the "lost-wax" process was used for religious images, the text also mentions its use in creating everyday objects like utensils.  The scope of its application was broader than just large-scale sculptures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although Chola bronzes are mentioned, the text indicates that the "lost-wax" technique was practiced across various regions of India, including Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal, and not limited to South India or the Chola period.


**5. With reference to the development of Buddhist art in Medieval India, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the panchayatana style and its presence in the Deogarh temple. The text explicitly mentions the central shrine and four corner shrines, all with curvilinear shikharas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Khajuraho temples are in the Nagara style, not Dravida.  The text clearly identifies them as Nagara temples.

Statement 3 correctly describes the Modhera Sun Temple. The text highlights the elaborate carving of the mandapa and the plainness of the central shrine, linking it to the sun's direct entry during equinoxes.


**7. With reference to the Vijayanagara and Nayaka painting styles, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vijayanagara paintings are characterized by figures depicted in profile, with faces shown in profile, and a two-dimensional representation of objects.
2.  Nayaka paintings, while showing some similarities to Vijayanagara style, introduced more three-dimensionality to the human figures.
3.  Both Vijayanagara and Nayaka paintings primarily depict scenes from Jataka tales and Buddhist mythology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Dravida temple style's defining features – the stepped pyramid vimana and the restricted use of "shikhara" for the topmost element.  Statement 2 is incorrect because it misattributes Odisha temple styles. Odisha temples are a distinct sub-style *within* the Nagara order, not a blend or hybrid.  Statement 3 correctly describes the Hoysala temple style as a blend, or hybrid, and accurately cites Halebid and Belur as prime examples of this unique stellate-plan architecture.

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that Chola period bronze sculptures of Nataraja invariably show the deity with four arms.  This is a specific detail highlighting a consistent feature of Chola iconography.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes the Kalyanasundara Murti as representing the marriage ceremony through *two separate statuettes*, not a single unified image.  This detail contrasts with the statement's claim, creating a deliberate distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the existence of life-size bronze portrait statues of Krishnadevaraya and his two queens in Tirupati, cast during the Vijayanagara period. This fact directly supports the statement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text mentions Pallava period bronzes showing Shiva in ardhaparyanka asana, but it specifies that he has *one* leg dangling and his *right hand* in the achamana mudra,  not eight hands.  The number of hands is altered to create a deceptive option. The question tests the examinee's ability to accurately recall specific details and avoid being misled by similar but incorrect information.

However, the statement incorrectly attributes the style to the Pala period. The source text places this sculpture within the context of  a discussion that includes the Pala period, but does not explicitly state that the Avalokitesvara is Pala style. This ambiguity is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text directly links the popularity of Tara images in bronze sculpture to the growth of Vajrayana Buddhism. This is a clear and direct correlation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text mentions Jain Tirthankaras from Chausa, Bihar, but does not specify the number of arms.  The statement introduces false information about the number of arms, serving as a strong distractor. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct concepts.



**4. With reference to prehistoric rock paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest discovered rock paintings in India, predating those of Altamira in Spain, were found in the Vindhya ranges of Madhya Pradesh.
2.  Rock paintings at Lakhudiyar, Uttarakhand, feature predominantly geometric patterns in white, black, and red ochre, alongside depictions of humans and animals.
3.  The rock shelters at Bhimbetka, Madhya Pradesh, showcase paintings exclusively from the Upper Palaeolithic period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions that the first discovery of rock paintings in India was before Altamira, it doesn't state that the earliest paintings were found in the Vindhya ranges.  The location is shifted to create a misleading statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the rock paintings at Lakhudiyar, Uttarakhand, including the colors, patterns, and subjects. This aligns precisely with the text's description.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Bhimbetka rock art is classified into seven historical periods, including Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Chalcolithic, not exclusively the Upper Palaeolithic. The statement falsely restricts the time period to create a distractor.  This question emphasizes the importance of precise recall of details and the ability to identify inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements.


**5. With reference to the Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Qutub Minar in Delhi exemplifies the early adoption of archuate construction in India, using voussoirs and keystones to support the structure's weight.
2.  Indo-Islamic architecture is characterized by a complete rejection of pre-existing Indian architectural and decorative forms.
3.  The use of tiles, with blue, turquoise, green, and yellow as popular colors, became widespread in surface decoration during the 14th-16th centuries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the Qutub Minar as an example of the introduction of archuate construction in India, using voussoirs and keystones, demonstrating a key shift in architectural techniques.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that Muslims absorbed many features of local cultures and traditions, combining them with their own architectural practices,  thus refuting the claim of complete rejection of pre-existing Indian forms.  This is a direct contradiction of the source material.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly notes the widespread use of tiles in surface decoration during the specified period,  mentioning the popular colors. This directly supports the statement's claim. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the blending of architectural styles and the ability to identify false statements based on direct contradictions in the text.


**6. With reference to the sculptural traditions of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The tallest monolithic free-standing structure in the world, the Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola, was commissioned by a Chola king.
2.  The Akota hoard of Jain bronzes, dated between the late 5th and late 7th centuries CE, showcases figures often inlaid with silver and copper.
3.  The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu, known for their simplistic exteriors and exuberant marble interiors, were constructed during the Vijayanagara period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text correctly identifies Gomateshwara as the tallest monolithic statue, but it was commissioned by Camundaraya, the General-in-Chief and Prime Minister of the Ganga Kings of Mysore, not a Chola king.  The royal patron is deliberately changed to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the Akota hoard of Jain bronzes, including their dating and the technique of inlay work. This perfectly matches the information provided.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text correctly describes the Dilwara temples at Mount Abu, but attributes their construction to Vimal Shah, not the Vijayanagara period.  The time period is incorrectly stated to create a misleading option.  This question focuses on the ability to recall specific details about different sculptural traditions and identify errors in statements related to patronage and chronology.



**7. With reference to the development of temple architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sun Temple at Konark originally had a shikhara that reached 70 meters in height, but it collapsed in the 19th century.
2.  Odisha temples are characterized by a deul (shikhara) that curves sharply inwards near the top, preceded by a jagamohana (mandapa).
3.  The main temple at Konark is built on a low base with minimal ornamentation, contrasting with the elaborate carvings found in other Odisha temples.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the original height of the Konark Sun Temple's shikhara and its subsequent collapse. This is a specific detail directly supported by the text.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage correctly describes the characteristic features of Odisha temples, including the deul's inward curve and the presence of the jagamohana.  This accurately reflects the architectural style.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text describes the Konark temple as having a high base and being lavishly carved, directly contradicting the statement's claim of minimal ornamentation.  The description of the base and ornamentation is deliberately altered to create a false statement. This question tests the ability to recall key features of specific temple architectural styles and identify discrepancies in descriptions.


**8. With reference to early Buddhist art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Amaravati Stupa, extensively developed during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, features a domical stupa structure covered with relief sculptural slabs.
2.  Early Buddhist art, in its initial phase, depicted the Buddha primarily through symbolic representations such as footprints and stupas, rather than anthropomorphic images.
3.  Sculptures at Bharhut, belonging to the early historic period, showcase high-relief figures with a naturalistic depiction of postures, devoid of stiffness.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the Amaravati Stupa's structure and its distinctive use of relief sculptural slabs. This corresponds directly with the passage's description.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage notes that in the early phase of Buddhism, the Buddha was depicted symbolically,  later transitioning to anthropomorphic representations.  This statement accurately reflects the evolution of Buddhist iconography.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text describes Bharhut sculptures as having low relief, figures that stick to the picture plane, and initially exhibiting stiffness in body postures.  The description of the relief style and the posture is deliberately altered to create a misleading option.  This question tests the understanding of the evolution of Buddhist art and the ability to differentiate between the stylistic features of different sites.



**1. With reference to the Hoysala temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. Hoysala temples are characterized by a stellate plan, resulting from numerous projecting angles from a central square.
2. The Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid was constructed using dark schist stone and is dedicated to Vishnu.
3. The intricate carvings on Hoysala temples, particularly in soapstone, are known for their detailed depictions of animals and deities, with no two elephants in the same pose in the continuous procession friezes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Hoysala temples are renowned for their unique stellate (star-like) ground plans, a result of the complex interplay of projecting angles extending from the initial square structure. This architectural feature allowed for extensive sculptural decoration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid was indeed built using dark schist stone, it's dedicated to Shiva as Nataraja, not Vishnu.  The temple's unique architectural style is sometimes referred to as vesara, a hybrid style blending Dravida and Nagara elements.

Statement 3 is correct. The exceptional level of detail in the Hoysala sculptures is a defining characteristic.  The artisans' mastery of carving, particularly in the softer soapstone, is evident in the profusion of decorative elements and the intricate details, including the famously diverse poses of the elephants in processional friezes.  No two elephants are alike in these depictions.


**2. With reference to Buddhist architectural developments in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mahabodhi Temple at Bodhgaya is a purely Dravida style temple with a curving shikhara.
2. Nalanda University was a complex of monasteries where Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhist doctrines were taught.
3. The sculptural art of Nalanda, primarily in stucco, stone, and bronze, was heavily influenced by the Gupta art of Sarnath and developed into a distinct Nalanda school.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mahabodhi Temple at Bodhgaya, while having a narrow structure reminiscent of Nagara style, doesn't strictly conform to either Dravida or Nagara styles. Its design is unique, rising vertically without the curving characteristic of Nagara shikharas.  It's not purely Dravida.

Statement 2 is correct. Nalanda University was a significant monastic complex where all three major branches of Buddhism – Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana – were taught. Its cosmopolitan nature attracted monks from across Asia.

Statement 3 is correct. The sculptural traditions of Nalanda drew heavily from the established Gupta style of Sarnath and Mathura, but over time developed its own distinct features, particularly in the treatment of facial features, body forms, and clothing. This led to the recognition of a unique Nalanda school of sculpture, known for its high quality of workmanship and three-dimensional figures.


**3. With reference to Vijayanagara architecture and its influences, consider the following statements:**

1. Vijayanagara architecture exclusively followed the Dravida style, demonstrating a lack of external influences.
2. The city of Vijayanagara attracted numerous international travelers who left detailed accounts of its architecture and cultural vibrancy.
3. Vijayanagara architecture synthesized Dravida temple architecture with Islamic styles from neighboring sultanates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Vijayanagara architecture, while rooted in Dravida traditions, demonstrably incorporated elements from other styles, including those of the neighboring Islamic sultanates.  It wasn't a purely Dravidian style.

Statement 2 is correct. Vijayanagara's prominence as a wealthy and cosmopolitan city attracted numerous international travelers, including Europeans like Niccolo di Conti and Domingo Paes, and the Afghan Abd al-Razzaq. Their accounts provide valuable insights into the city's architecture and vibrant culture.

Statement 3 is correct. Vijayanagara architecture is a prime example of cultural synthesis. The architects skillfully combined long-standing Dravida temple design principles with elements gleaned from the architectural styles prevalent in the nearby Islamic sultanates. This fusion created a unique and distinctive architectural idiom.

1. The "Dancing Girl" from Mohenjo-daro is the earliest known bronze sculpture, dating to 2500 BCE and exhibiting a sophisticated understanding of human anatomy.
2. Chola bronze sculptures, particularly Nataraja figures, are renowned for their exquisite beauty, aesthetic appeal, and technical mastery, and were primarily produced for ritual worship.
3. The lost-wax casting process, used extensively in bronze sculpture, originated in the Gupta period and spread throughout India and parts of Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that the Dancing Girl is an early example, but the statement overstates the anatomical detail.  While significant, the anatomy is simplified compared to later works. The date is also accepted.

Statement 2 is correct. Chola bronze sculptures, particularly the iconic Nataraja depictions, represent a peak of technical skill and artistic achievement in Indian bronze casting. Their exquisite beauty, detailed work and aesthetic appeal led to their widespread use in ritual worship and their enduring popularity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The lost-wax casting process is far older than the Gupta period; its origins trace back to the Indus Valley Civilization. The technique's continued use and refinement throughout India's history led to its dissemination across various regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, but its origins are much earlier.


**5.  With reference to the Indo-Islamic architecture of Mandu, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama Masjid at Mandu exhibits a distinctly regional style, sharply diverging from the architectural traditions of Imperial Delhi.
2.  Pathan architecture in Mandu is characterized by robust, austere features, complemented by surface embellishments like jalis and carved brackets.
3. The architecture of Mandu demonstrates a significant departure from the prevailing Indo-Islamic architectural trends of its time, establishing a unique local tradition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Mandu's architecture possesses unique characteristics, it's considered closer to the architectural styles of Imperial Delhi than drastically different.  It doesn't represent a radical departure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Pathan architecture of Mandu is indeed characterized by a combination of robust, austere forms and delicate surface ornamentation. The use of jalis (latticed screens) and carved brackets is a prominent feature, adding complexity to the otherwise simple forms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Mandu's architectural style, while possessing unique features, didn't represent a complete break from the broader Indo-Islamic architectural narrative of the period. It contributed to, but didn't redefine, the overall trajectory.

1. The Taj Mahal's construction, completed in 1632, involved approximately 20,000 workers and took nearly twenty years.
2. The Taj Mahal complex is laid out in a Chahar Bagh plan, with the mausoleum situated in the middle of the garden to maximize its visual impact.
3. The Taj Mahal's interior features extensive use of pietra dura inlay work, calligraphy in jasper, and carved jalis, all contributing to its aesthetic magnificence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 but was completed around 1653, taking approximately 22 years. The number of workers involved was also significant, but the exact figure is debated and not precisely 20,000.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Taj Mahal complex follows a Chahar Bagh plan, but the mausoleum is not centrally located. Instead, it is positioned at the northern end of the garden to take advantage of the Yamuna River's proximity.

Statement 3 is correct. The interior of the Taj Mahal showcases a remarkable display of decorative artistry.  Pietra dura inlay work, intricate calligraphy using jasper, and exquisitely carved jalis are prominent features contributing to its unmatched aesthetic appeal and artistic excellence.  The use of these decorative elements reflects the high artistic skill of the period.

1. Jama Masjids were primarily small structures designed for daily prayers by a limited number of worshippers.
2. The Qibla Liwan, located in the west, housed the mihrab and mimbar, essential features for congregational prayers.
3. Jama Masjids in medieval India served only religious functions, without any socio-cultural or political significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jama Masjids were large-scale structures designed to accommodate a significant number of worshippers for Friday prayers, requiring at least forty adult Muslim men.  Their size reflects their importance.

Statement 2 is correct. The Qibla Liwan, always situated on the western wall, housed the mihrab (niche indicating the direction of Mecca) and mimbar (pulpit). These were crucial elements in the organization and conduct of congregational prayers.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Jama Masjids, besides their religious functions, played a vital socio-cultural and even political role in medieval Indian cities. They served as centers for commercial and cultural exchange, and their proximity to the ruler's pronouncements meant they had indirect political importance.


**8. With reference to Nagara temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The latina or rekha-prasada type of shikhara is characterized by a square base and gently sloping walls that rise to a single point.
2. The phamsana type of Nagara temple building is typically taller and more sharply pointed than the latina type.
3. The valabhi type of Nagara temple is a rectangular building with a wagon-vaulted roof, reminiscent of ancient wooden or bamboo structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The latina or rekha-prasada shikhara is a defining feature of Nagara temple architecture. Its square base and gently curving, inward-sloping walls culminating in a single point at the apex are its key characteristics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The phamsana type of Nagara temple is broader and shorter than the latina type, with its roof composed of multiple slabs gently rising to a single point. It lacks the sharp, tall tower-like appearance of the latina shikhara.

Statement 3 is correct. The valabhi type of Nagara temple is characterized by its rectangular shape and distinctive wagon-vaulted roof, a design that reflects the influence of earlier building traditions, particularly those using bamboo or wood.  The curved roofline is a key element.


**9. With reference to the Deogarh temple in Uttar Pradesh, consider the following statements:**

1. The Deogarh temple, built in the early sixth century CE, is a classic example of the late Gupta period temple architecture.
2. The temple is oriented towards the east and features a panchayatana style plan with a single, tall, curvilinear shikhara.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Deogarh temple's architectural style and iconography firmly place it within the late Gupta period, demonstrating features that evolved from earlier Gupta-era temples. Its construction date is consistent with that period.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The temple is a panchayatana style structure, meaning it has a central shrine and four smaller ones at the corners. However, it faces west, not east and has a tall, curvilinear shikhara, a hallmark of the Nagara style.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the temple features Vishnu in various forms (Sheshashayana, Nara-Narayan, Gajendramoksha), it's not exclusively a dasavatara temple. The dedications of the four subsidiary shrines are unknown.  It's not solely focused on the ten avatars.


**10. With reference to Khajuraho temples, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lakshmana temple at Khajuraho, built in 954 CE, is dedicated to Shiva and features a single, tall shikhara.
2. Khajuraho temples are known for their extensive erotic sculptures, which are integrated into the broader cosmic and spiritual themes of the temples.
3. The Kandariya Mahadeo temple at Khajuraho is dedicated to Vishnu and is the grandest temple in the complex.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lakshmana temple at Khajuraho, built in 954 CE, is dedicated to Vishnu, not Shiva. It features multiple, tall shikharas rising in a curved pyramidal fashion, not a single one.

Statement 2 is correct.  Khajuraho temples are indeed famous for their extensive erotic sculptures. These sculptures, depicting mithunas (embracing couples), are not separate from the spiritual themes but are considered part of a larger cosmic whole, reflecting the complex understanding of human experience in the context of spirituality.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Kandariya Mahadeo temple at Khajuraho is dedicated to Shiva, not Vishnu. While it's a significant temple, the Lakshmana temple is often considered the grandest in the complex.  The statements interchange the deities.


**11. With reference to the Sun Temple at Modhera, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sun Temple at Modhera, built in the early eleventh century, was constructed by Raja Bhimdev I of the Chaulukya dynasty.
2. The temple features a massive rectangular stepped tank (surya kund) in front, with one hundred and eight miniature shrines carved into its steps.
3. The temple's central shrine is lavishly carved and decorated to maximize the visual impact.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sun Temple at Modhera was indeed built in the early eleventh century by Raja Bhimdev I, belonging to the Solanki dynasty, a branch of the later Chalukyas. The date and patron are accurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The temple complex includes a large, rectangular, stepped tank (surya kund) in front of the main temple. This tank features one hundred and eight miniature shrines carved into its steps, demonstrating the integration of water elements into sacred architecture.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The central shrine of the Modhera Sun Temple is intentionally left plain, devoid of carvings. This is because the temple's orientation towards the east allows the sun's rays to directly illuminate the shrine during the equinoxes, a deliberate design choice. The statement contradicts the facts.


**12. With reference to temple architecture in Odisha, consider the following statements:**

1. Odisha temples are classified into three orders: rekhapida, pidhadeul, and khakra, each with distinct architectural features.
2. The Sun Temple at Konark, built around 1240, originally had a colossal shikhara (deul) that reached 70 meters in height.

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Pala style of sculpture, flourishing during the ninth to eleventh centuries in Bengal and Bihar, is known for its tall, gracefully curving shikharas topped by a large amalaka, a decorative element found in many Nagara-style temples.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sena style, while having its own distinct features, didn't entirely abandon the stylistic influences of the preceding Pala style. Instead, it built upon and modified existing traditions, leading to a gradual evolution rather than a complete break.

Statement 3 is correct. The Siddheshvara Mahadeva temple at Barakar exemplifies the early Pala style and shows clear stylistic similarities to contemporaneous temples found in Odisha.  This reflects the interconnectedness of artistic influences across regions.

(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The fourteenth-century paintings at Tiruparakunram near Trichy represent an early example of the Vijayanagara style, and depict scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata along with other dynastic and religious themes.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Nayaka paintings, while showing regional variations, largely continued the stylistic traditions established during the Vijayanagara period. They didn't abandon the earlier style entirely, but rather built upon and adapted it.

Statement 3 is correct.  Vijayanagara painting developed a distinctive style, marked by profile views of faces, a two-dimensional representation of figures and objects, and the use of rectilinear compartments to organize compositions. These conventions influenced later painting styles in South India.


**15. With reference to Kerala murals, consider the following statements:**

1. Kerala murals, produced from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, completely ignored stylistic influences from other South Indian schools.
2. The thematic content of Kerala murals primarily focuses on local versions of the Ramayana and Mahabharata, reflecting regional traditions.

The text details the use of this technique in various regions, highlighting regional variations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sultanganj Buddha is specifically mentioned in the text as an outstanding example of a monumental bronze figure showcasing a refined style characteristic of Gupta and post-Gupta periods (5th-7th centuries).  This highlights the evolution and high artistic standards achieved in bronze casting during this era.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir produced bronze images of both Buddhist and Hindu deities.  The mention of four-headed Vishnu (Chaturanana or Vaikuntha Vishnu), Narasimha avatar, and Mahishasuramardini Durga indicates a significant presence of Hindu iconography in the bronze sculptures of these regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text discusses the influence of various styles on the Pala and other regional schools, it does not specifically mention the Amaravati style as a primary influence on the Pala style. The Pala style shows a synthesis of Gupta and other regional traditions, but the text does not prioritize Amaravati.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly describes the Nalanda school of sculpture as a synthesis of the Sarnath Gupta style, local Bihar traditions, and Central Indian influences. This fusion of styles is a crucial aspect of the Nalanda school's unique characteristics.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that Vijayanagara architecture synthesized centuries-old Dravida temple architecture with Islamic styles from neighboring sultanates. This blending of architectural traditions is a key feature of Vijayanagara's architectural legacy.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  The majority of Indus Valley seals were made of hard, durable stones like granite, showcasing advanced stone-cutting techniques.
2.  The "Dancing Girl" bronze statue from Mohenjodaro is characterized by simplified, tubular limbs and torso, unlike the more realistic depictions found in later periods.
3. The Indus Valley Civilization's pottery primarily consisted of painted ware, with plain pottery being relatively rare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that the standard Harappan seal was made from soft river stone, steatite.  This indicates a choice of material based on its ease of carving, rather than the use of hard, durable stones.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the "Dancing Girl" statue clearly mentions simplified, tubular forms for the limbs and torso. This stylistic choice contrasts with the more realistic anatomical representations found in later sculptural traditions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that plain pottery was *more* common than painted ware in the Indus Valley Civilization. This contradicts the statement's assertion that painted ware was the primary type of pottery.


**5. With reference to prehistoric rock paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest discovered rock paintings in India were found in the Bhimbetka caves in Madhya Pradesh.
2.  The rock paintings of Lakhudiyar, Uttarakhand, primarily feature naturalistic depictions of animals, with minimal use of geometric patterns.
3.  The Bhimbetka rock paintings encompass a wide range of themes, from daily life activities to sacred and royal imagery, spanning multiple historical periods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the first discovery of rock paintings in India was made in 1867-68, predating the discovery of Bhimbetka caves. While Bhimbetka is a significant site, it wasn't the first location where such paintings were found in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Lakhudiyar paintings are described as including not only animal motifs but also human figures (in stick-like forms) and geometric patterns. The description doesn't support the claim that animal depictions are the sole or primary focus.

Statement 3 is correct. The text details the diverse range of themes depicted in the Bhimbetka paintings, including daily life scenes, hunting, dancing, and even sacred and royal imagery.  The mention of multiple historical periods further emphasizes the breadth of the artistic record found at this site.


**6. With reference to Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama Masjid at Mandu is characterized by a predominantly Dravidian architectural style, with minimal Islamic influences.
2.  The Taj Mahal's construction involved the use of marble quarried primarily from local sources near Agra.
3.  The Gol Gumbad, despite being unfinished, exemplifies the grandeur and majesty of Indo-Islamic architecture through its scale and unique dome.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes the Jama Masjid at Mandu as having a style considered close to structures of Imperial Delhi, implying a stronger Islamic influence than Dravidian.  The mention of red sandstone and domes further reinforces this Islamic architectural connection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the marble for the Taj Mahal was quarried from the Makrana mines in Rajasthan, not from local sources near Agra. This highlights the extensive reach of the construction project and the use of specific high-quality materials.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that despite being unfinished, the Gol Gumbad's grandeur and majesty are still evident in its scale and unique dome design.  This reinforces the point that even incomplete structures can showcase the architectural prowess of a period.


**7. With reference to temple architecture in South India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram primarily features a single shrine dedicated to Shiva.
2.  The Brihadiswara Temple at Thanjavur showcases a monolithic shikhara, a unique feature of Chola architecture.
3.  The Kailashnath Temple at Ellora exemplifies the Vesara style of temple architecture, a hybrid style incorporating elements of both Nagara and Dravida styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram houses *three* shrines – two dedicated to Shiva and one to Vishnu (as Anantashayana). This multi-shrine configuration is unusual and contradicts the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text describes the Brihadiswara Temple's shikhara as a monolithic octagonal dome-shaped stupika, emphasizing its unique architectural characteristic within the Chola style.

Statement 3 is correct. The text identifies the Kailashnath Temple at Ellora as a complete Dravida building, but also acknowledges that the region of Karnataka (where it's located) features experimental hybrid styles sometimes referred to as Vesara, which blends Nagara and Dravida elements.  Thus, classifying it as Vesara is not inaccurate, given the broader context.

1. The Lion Capital at Sarnath features four lions seated back-to-back on a square abacus, symbolizing the four cardinal directions.
2.  The Didarganj Yakshini is a life-size standing image carved from granite, showcasing high polishing and detailed anatomical representation.
3.  Mauryan pillars were constructed from individual stone pieces assembled by masons, unlike the rock-cut pillars of later periods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Lion Capital at Sarnath does feature four lions seated back-to-back, the abacus is described as circular, not square.  The circular abacus is a key element of its design.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect.  The Didarganj Yakshini is indeed a life-size standing image and is highly polished, with detailed anatomical representation. However, the material is sandstone, not granite.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Mauryan pillars are *rock-cut*, distinguishing them from pillars constructed from assembled pieces.  This highlights the advanced stone-carving techniques of the Mauryan period.


**1. With reference to Indo-Islamic architecture in Mandu, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama Masjid in Mandu features a monumental gateway topped with a squat dome and an open courtyard.
2. Mandu's Pathan architecture is distinctly different from the architectural styles of Imperial Delhi, showcasing unique local traditions.
3. The Jahaz Mahal in Mandu is a prime example of the robust and austere Pathan architectural style, characterized by its extensive use of jalis and carved brackets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the key architectural features of the Jama Masjid in Mandu.  The monumental gateway, squat dome, open courtyard, and columned cloisters are all well-documented aspects of its design.  Statement 3 correctly highlights the Jahaz Mahal's association with the Pathan style, noting its use of jalis (lattice screens) and carved brackets.  These elements, while also present in other Indo-Islamic architectures, contribute to the overall aesthetic of Mandu's buildings.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that Mandu's Pathan architecture is considered "too close to the structures of Imperial Delhi," implying a lack of significant deviation from the architectural traditions of the Delhi Sultanate.  This suggests a continuity rather than a distinct break from the prevailing Indo-Islamic styles of the time. The statement misrepresents the architectural relationship between Mandu and Delhi.  While regional variations certainly existed within Indo-Islamic architecture, Mandu's style is not presented as a radical departure from the Imperial Delhi style in the provided text.


**2. With reference to the Taj Mahal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Taj Mahal's construction, completed in 1653, involved approximately 20,000 specialized workers and spanned nearly two decades.
2.  The Taj Mahal's main structure is a perfect octagon, faced with white marble quarried from the Makrana mines in Rajasthan, and is surrounded by four minarets.
3. The Taj Mahal's interior features a double dome creating a high ceiling, intricate jalis for light, and pietra dura inlay work with Quranic verses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the scale and duration of the Taj Mahal's construction, mentioning the large workforce and the timeframe. Statement 3 correctly describes the interior features: the double dome creating height, the use of jalis (perforated stone screens) to control light, and the application of pietra dura (inlaid precious stones) in creating decorative arabesques and calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran. These details are all consistent with historical accounts and architectural analyses of the Taj Mahal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Taj Mahal's main structure is faced with white Makrana marble, it is not an octagon but a square with chamfers (beveled edges) creating an eight-sided appearance.  Furthermore, the four minarets are located at the corners of the terrace surrounding the tomb, not directly attached to the main structure itself. The statement combines and alters several facts to create a misleading description.


**3. With reference to the evolution of Indo-Islamic architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The introduction of the arch and dome allowed for the construction of larger, pillar-free interiors in mosques and other buildings.
2.  Indo-Islamic architecture in India developed independently of pre-existing Indian architectural traditions, showcasing a purely Islamic style.
3. The use of jalis, arabesques, and calligraphy became defining decorative elements in Indo-Islamic architecture, reflecting the religious restrictions against figural representation in Islamic art.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a crucial technological and aesthetic shift in Indo-Islamic architecture. The adoption of the arch and dome construction techniques from West Asia allowed for larger, more open interior spaces, a significant departure from earlier architectural styles. Statement 3 correctly identifies the key decorative elements—jalis (lattice screens), arabesques (floral and geometric designs), and calligraphy—as hallmarks of Indo-Islamic architecture.  These elements were used extensively because Islamic artistic traditions generally avoided the depiction of living beings in religious contexts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage emphasizes the fusion of Islamic architectural practices with pre-existing Indian techniques and aesthetics. This blending of styles is a defining characteristic of Indo-Islamic architecture, not a rejection of Indian traditions. The statement wrongly presents the style as purely Islamic, ignoring the significant Indian influences.

3.  Jain temple architecture is largely confined to Gujarat and Rajasthan, with few examples found in other parts of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola, highlighting its size, material, and the fact that it was commissioned by Camundaraya, the General-in-Chief and Prime Minister of the Ganga Kings of Mysore (not a Ganga king directly).  Statement 2 correctly describes the Dilwara Temples at Mount Abu, their architectural style, and their construction by Vimal Shah.  The description of the unique ceiling patterns is also accurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions Jain pilgrimage sites and temples across India, including Bihar, the Deccan (Ellora and Aihole), central India (Deogarh, Khajuraho, Chanderi, and Gwalior), and Karnataka.  This demonstrates a wider geographical distribution than the statement suggests.  The statement is a gross oversimplification of the geographical spread of Jain temple architecture.


**5. With reference to the architectural styles of South Indian temples, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dravida style of temple architecture is characterized by a stepped pyramid-like vimana, a gopuram as the entrance gateway, and the use of a square ground plan that becomes circular at the top.
2. The Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram, built during the reign of Narasimhavarman I, features three shrines dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu.
3. Hoysala temples, often categorized as Vesara style, are distinguished by their stellate (star-like) ground plans and intricate carvings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the key features of the Dravida style of temple architecture. The stepped pyramid form of the vimana, the gopuram entrance, and the transition from a square to a circular shape at the top are all characteristic elements. Statement 3 correctly identifies the features of Hoysala temples, including their unique stellate ground plans and the elaborate decorative carvings. The description of the style as Vesara is also accurate, reflecting its hybrid nature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram does feature three shrines, it was built during the reign of Narasimhavarman II (Rajasimha), not Narasimhavarman I.  The statement misattributes the construction to the wrong king.


**6. With reference to the Kailashnath Temple at Ellora, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kailashnath Temple is a monolithic rock-cut structure, carved entirely from a single hill, and is a prime example of Rashtrakuta architecture.
2. The temple's design incorporates elements of both Dravida and Nagara architectural styles, showcasing a hybrid approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct in that the Kailashnath Temple is indeed a monolithic structure carved from a single rock and represents a peak achievement of Rashtrakuta architecture. Statement 3 accurately describes the distinctive characteristics of the temple's sculptures—their scale, dynamic poses, and overall impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kailashnath Temple is primarily considered a Dravida-style temple, not a hybrid of Dravida and Nagara styles. While influences from other styles might be present in some details, the overall architectural design firmly belongs to the Dravida tradition.


**7. With reference to bronze sculpture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Dancing Girl" from Mohenjo-daro is an early example of bronze sculpture, dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization, and is crafted using the cire-perdu (lost-wax) method.
2. Chola bronze sculptures, particularly those from the 10th-12th centuries CE, are renowned for their refined aesthetic and technical mastery and are often depicted in tribhanga posture.
3. The lost-wax casting technique, used for bronze sculptures, involved the use of a single metal, typically copper, and required minimal skill and precision.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate in its description of the "Dancing Girl" and its significance as an early bronze sculpture from the Indus Valley Civilization, although the text does not explicitly state that it uses the lost-wax method, but mentions that the process was known during the Indus Valley Civilization. Statement 2 correctly highlights the importance of Chola bronze sculptures, their aesthetic qualities, and the prevalence of the tribhanga posture (three bends in the body).

Statement 3 is incorrect. The lost-wax process involved the creation of a wax model, which was then encased in clay and fired, allowing molten metal (often an alloy of copper, zinc, and tin) to flow in and take the shape of the melted wax. It was a complex and highly skilled process. The statement incorrectly simplifies the process and downplays the skill involved.

1. Vijayanagara paintings, found in places like Hampi and Lepakshi, are characterized by profile views of faces, two-dimensional figures, and the use of rectilinear compartments in compositions.
2. Nayaka paintings, which followed the Vijayanagara style, depicted scenes from the epics and Puranas but avoided portraying any historical events.
3. Kerala mural paintings, created between the 16th and 18th centuries, developed a unique style influenced by local traditions like Kathakali dance and are often found in temples and palaces, and are two-dimensional.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the stylistic features of Vijayanagara paintings—profile faces, two-dimensional figures, and the organization of compositions within rectilinear frames.  Statement 3 correctly notes the development of a distinct Kerala mural painting style during the specified period, its influences (including Kathakali), and its typical locations (temples and palaces). The statement also describes the paintings as three-dimensional, which is in contrast to the two-dimensional figures in the Vijayanagara style.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Nayaka paintings did depict scenes from the epics and Puranas, but they also included depictions of historical events and royal figures, as evidenced by the examples mentioned in the text. The statement is an oversimplification of the themes portrayed.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nataraja iconography, depicting Shiva's cosmic dance, achieved its full development during the Chola period.  Many variations on this complex and symbolic image were produced, showcasing the artistic skill and innovation of Chola bronze casters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ardhaparyanka asana and achamana mudra are indeed associated with Shiva iconography, the provided text attributes these specifically to Pallava period bronzes, not Chola bronzes.  The description of Shiva seated in this posture, about to drink poison, is clearly linked to Pallava art.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Kalyanasundara Murti, representing Shiva's marriage to Parvati, is described in the text as being depicted through *two separate statuettes*, not a single image. The text highlights the ingenious representation of the union through separate figures, rather than a combined form. The ardhanarisvara murti, a single image representing the union of Shiva and Parvati, is mentioned, but not specifically as a Chola bronze representation.


**3. With reference to the techniques of bronze casting in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The "lost-wax" process, also known as the cire-perdu process, was a technique employed across various regions of India, including Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal, each with slight regional variations.
2.  The alloy used in bronze casting during the Gupta period consisted primarily of copper, zinc, and tin, and this remained consistent throughout all later periods.

This highlights the evolution and regional variations within Indian temple architecture.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly mentions that Nalanda University taught all three major Buddhist doctrines—Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana—attracting monks from various parts of Asia. This demonstrates the university's importance as a center of Buddhist learning and its global connections.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Ellora and Badami are mentioned as having monuments representing multiple religions, Khajuraho is primarily known for its Hindu temples, and Kannauj, although having remains of two religions, doesn't explicitly specify which two in the given text.  The statement therefore presents an overgeneralization.

These elements are key to understanding the monument's aesthetic impact.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage notes that Gol Gumbad, despite being unfinished, "symbolises the grandeur and majesty of Indo-Islamic architecture." The text does not elaborate on the specific features contributing to this grandeur, but the implicit understanding is that the scale and the dome itself create a sense of impressive architecture even in its incomplete state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Latina or Rekha-prasada shikhara, a defining feature of Nagara temple architecture.  The description of its square base, inward-sloping walls, and pointed apex aligns precisely with the architectural style. Statement 2 correctly differentiates the Phamsana style from the Latina style.  It highlights the Phamsana's broader, shorter form and its multi-slabbed roof structure, contrasting it with the sharply rising Latina tower.  The frequent use of Phamsana for mandapas (assembly halls) in North Indian temples is also historically accurate.  Statement 3, however, is incorrect. Valabhi-type Nagara temples are rectangular, not circular, with a wagon-vaulted roof. While the influence of early Buddhist rock-cut chaitya caves on the curved roof is accurate, the description of the temple's shape is fundamentally flawed.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the widespread use of sandstone in temple construction across Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan during the Gupta period. This is a significant characteristic of the region's temple architecture. Statement 2 accurately describes the Dashavatara temple at Deogarh. Its construction in the early sixth century CE, its adherence to the panchayatana style (five shrines), and its prominent latina shikhara are all well-established facts. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Lakshmana temple at Khajuraho, while a Nagara-style temple with multiple tall, curvilinear shikharas, does *not* feature a single shikhara. The description contradicts the temple's well-known architectural design. Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are completely correct, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the false statement about the Lakshmana temple's shikhara.

1. Dravida temples are typically enclosed within a compound wall, featuring a central entrance gateway known as a gopuram.
2. The main temple tower, called a vimana, is a stepped pyramid rising geometrically, unlike the curving shikhara of Nagara temples.
3.  The primary deity is housed in a small, unadorned garbhagriha, while the gopuram and surrounding structures are lavishly decorated.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key features of Dravida temple architecture. Statement 1 correctly identifies the characteristic compound wall and the central gopuram as defining elements.  Statement 2 accurately contrasts the stepped pyramidal vimana of Dravida temples with the curving shikhara of Nagara temples. This fundamental difference in architectural style is crucial for distinguishing between the two traditions. Statement 3 is also correct.  While the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) often houses the main deity, it's typically relatively plain and unadorned in comparison to the elaborate ornamentation of the gopuram and other external components. The focus on external decoration is a stylistic feature of Dravida temples. Therefore, all three statements are true, making (d) the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of all three statements.


**4.  With reference to the Sun Temple at Modhera, consider the following statements:**

1.  Built in the early eleventh century by Raja Bhimdev I of the Solanki dynasty, it features a large rectangular stepped tank called the Surya Kund.

3. The temple's east-facing orientation ensures that the sun's rays directly illuminate the central shrine during the equinoxes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the construction of the Sun Temple at Modhera, its builder, and its prominent Surya Kund.  The Solanki dynasty patronage and the existence of the large stepped tank are historical facts. Statement 3 is also correct. The temple's east-facing design is significant, as it allows for the direct illumination of the central shrine by the sun during the equinoxes. This architectural feature is integral to the temple's design and function. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The central shrine is *not* lavishly carved; it's intentionally left plain to maximize the effect of the sunlight during the equinoxes.  The influence of Gujarat's woodcarving tradition is evident in other parts of the temple complex, but not the central shrine itself. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate, making (a) the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect because they include the false statement about the carving of the central shrine.

2.  The Dravida style, common in South India, utilized gopurams as entrance gateways and vimanas as stepped pyramid-shaped main temple towers.
3. The Vesara style represents a fusion of Nagara and Dravida elements, predominantly found in the central Indian region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the latina-type shikhara is a common feature of the Nagara style, it's not exclusive. The text mentions other subtypes within the Nagara order, such as phamsana and valabhi, indicating a stylistic diversity beyond the simple latina form. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of the Nagara style's complexity.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the Dravida style's key features: the use of gopurams as prominent entrance gateways and vimanas as the characteristic stepped pyramid-shaped main temple towers. This description aligns perfectly with the information provided.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While Vesara style is indeed a hybrid style incorporating elements of Nagara and Dravida, its geographic distribution is not solely limited to central India. The text mentions its prevalence in Karnataka, indicating a broader geographical spread than solely central India.  The statement is therefore misleading in its geographical limitation.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pala style, while having its distinct regional characteristics, was significantly influenced by the Gupta style of sculpture. The text explicitly mentions the synthesis of the Sarnath Gupta idiom with local Bihar traditions and central Indian styles in the formation of the Nalanda school of sculpture, which is closely tied to the Pala style. The statement inaccurately portrays the Pala style's artistic influences.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Chola bronze sculptures are indeed known for their aesthetic appeal, their subject matter wasn't limited to scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The text focuses on their depiction of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain icons, indicating a wider range of subjects than the statement suggests. The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of Chola sculptural representations.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately describes the Hoysala sculptures, emphasizing their intricate carvings in soapstone and the distinctive stellate-plan temple designs they often adorned.  This description is consistent with the information provided.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Vijayanagara paintings are actually characterized by figures shown predominantly in profile, not full-frontal poses. The text explicitly states that the Vijayanagara painters depicted faces in profile and figures and objects two-dimensionally. This contradicts the statement's assertion of three-dimensional representation and full-frontal poses.


Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly indicates that Kerala murals, while drawing inspiration from Nayaka and Vijayanagara styles, developed their own unique pictorial language and techniques, reflecting a distinct regional identity. This demonstrates selective adoption and adaptation, not mere imitation.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Badami cave paintings represent an extension of the Ajanta mural painting tradition, highlighting similarities in line drawing, fluid forms, and compact composition. This demonstrates a clear stylistic link between the two periods.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Qutub Minar, while an example of Indo-Islamic architecture, was not built entirely of marble. The text clearly mentions that it was primarily constructed of red and buff sandstone, with marble used only in the upper storeys.  Furthermore, it's inaccurate to suggest that it was devoid of regional influences, as architectural styles often blend regional and external elements. The statement is factually inaccurate and presents an overly simplistic view.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly names Chittor, Gwalior, Daulatabad, and Golconda as examples of forts that utilized commanding heights and incorporated complex defensive strategies, showcasing the strategic aspects of medieval fort architecture. The description accurately reflects the textual information.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Sarais were public accommodations, not exclusively for royal use. The text clearly states that Sarais provided temporary lodging for various travelers, including merchants, pilgrims, and traders, highlighting their public function and role in facilitating cultural exchange. The statement misrepresents the primary function and usage of Sarais.

Statement 2 accurately describes the symmetrical layout of the Taj Mahal complex, emphasizing the positioning of the mosque and a similar structure to the west and east of the main mausoleum to maintain visual balance.  This is a key feature of the design, reflecting the Mughal emphasis on symmetry and harmony. Statement 3 is incorrect. The main structure of the Taj Mahal is described as a square with chamfers, forming *eight* sides, not twelve. This modification alters the geometric description and makes the statement factually incorrect. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 3.

3.  The minaret, a common feature of large mosques, was primarily used for the azaan (call to prayer) and symbolized the ruler's power and authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Qibla Liwan, which indicates the direction of Mecca, is consistently described as being located in the *west*, not the east, of the mosque's courtyard.  This is a fundamental aspect of mosque orientation in Islam. Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Statement 2 accurately describes the socio-political role of the Khutba, which was read in the mosque during Friday prayers, announcing the ruler's authority and laws. The mosque thus served as a space for religious practice and the dissemination of political decrees. Statement 3 correctly identifies the minaret's dual function as a space for the azaan and a symbol of the ruler's power.  Its height often served as a visual representation of the ruler's authority. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct, making option (a) the only accurate choice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While royal patronage existed, the text emphasizes the collective nature of patronage, with participation from guilds, private donors, and religious institutions.  Royal patronage was not the sole source of funding for artistic projects. Statement 2 is correct. The passage mentions inscriptions detailing the participation of guilds of artisans, highlighting their significant role in art production during this period.  This collective effort is a key feature of the artistic process. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that patronage for stupas and viharas was collective, involving various donors and not limited to royal patronage.  Private donors and religious institutions played a substantial role in funding these projects. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the artistic lineage between the Ajanta and Badami mural painting traditions. The passage explicitly notes the stylistic continuity, highlighting the shared characteristics of sinuous lines and fluid forms. Statement 2 accurately reflects the Pallava kings' patronage of murals in their temples, even though only fragments survive today.  This highlights their role in supporting the arts.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage describes Chola murals as demonstrating "supple modelling of figures" and "elongation of physiognomic features," indicating a dynamic and expressive style, rather than a conservative one.  This contradicts the statement's claim of stiff and static figures. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.

1.  The Lakshmana temple at Sirpur, known for its early Buddhist shrines, exemplifies the oldest Jain pilgrimage sites in Bihar.
2.  The Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola, Karnataka, is the world's tallest monolithic free-standing structure, commissioned by Camundaraya.
3.  The Jain temples at Mount Abu, constructed by Vimal Shah, are characterized by a simplistic exterior and exuberant marble interiors with deep undercutting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sirpur has a Lakshmana temple, it's associated with Hinduism, not Jainism, and isn't considered one of the oldest Jain pilgrimage sites. The oldest Jain pilgrimage sites are located in various parts of India, including Bihar, but Sirpur's religious affiliation is primarily Hindu.  Bihar does indeed have many early Buddhist shrines, often located near early Jain sites.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola is indeed the world's tallest monolithic free-standing structure, commissioned by Camundaraya, the General-in-Chief and Prime Minister of the Ganga Kings of Mysore. This fact is well-established in art history.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Jain temples at Mount Abu, built by Vimal Shah, are renowned for their contrast between a simple exterior and richly carved, exuberant marble interiors featuring deep undercutting, creating a lace-like effect.  This architectural style is a key feature of these temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Hoysala temples are renowned for their stellate (star-shaped) ground plans and extensive use of soapstone, a relatively soft stone that allowed for highly detailed carvings, particularly noticeable in the intricate jewelry adorning the temple walls.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid is indeed dedicated to Shiva as Nataraja and comprises a double building with a substantial mandapa designed to accommodate music and dance performances.  A Nandi pavilion precedes each building.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid and the temple at Belur originally possessed towers, these have long since collapsed.  The description of intact towers and miniature versions flanking the entrances is inaccurate.  The current appearance of the temples can only be inferred from these miniature representations. The "vesara" style, a hybrid of Dravida and Nagara styles, is accurately described, however.


**2. With reference to the architectural styles of East India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Assamese temple architecture, influenced by the Pala style of Bengal and the Tais migration from Upper Burma, developed a distinct regional style, exemplified by the Ahom style around Guwahati.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Pala style, prominent from the ninth to eleventh centuries in Bengal and Bihar, featured tall, curving shikharas, as illustrated by the Siddheshvara Mahadeva temple in Burdwan District.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Odisha temples are indeed part of the nagara order and frequently feature a deul (shikhara) that curves sharply inwards near the top, and often have a jagamohana mandapa,  the assertion that *all* Odisha temples have boundary walls is an oversimplification.  The classification of Odisha temples into rekhapida, pidhadeul, and khakra orders indicates stylistic variations within the nagara order.


**3. With reference to the Nalanda University and its artistic legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nalanda school of sculpture, flourishing from the 7th to 12th centuries, primarily showcased Buddhist deities of the Mahayana pantheon, with Vajrayana deities becoming dominant only in the late 11th and 12th centuries.

**1. With reference to the architectural features of the Taj Mahal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Taj Mahal's main structure is a perfect cube, with chamfers creating eight sides, and recessed with deep arches.
2.  The Taj Mahal complex is entered through a monumental red sandstone gateway, the opening arch of which beautifully frames the mausoleum.  The tomb is laid out in a Charbagh garden.
3.  The interior of the Taj Mahal's mausoleum consists of a crypt below and a vaulted, octagonal tomb chamber above, illuminated by carved and perforated jalis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Taj Mahal's main structure is indeed a square with chamfers creating eight sides and recessed deep arches, describing it as a "perfect cube" is inaccurate. A cube has equal length, width, and height, while the Taj Mahal's height is significantly less than its base dimensions.

Statement 2 is correct. The description accurately reflects the entrance to the Taj Mahal complex and its layout within the Charbagh garden.  The Charbagh, a four-part garden, is a common feature in Mughal architecture, symbolizing paradise.

Statement 3 is also correct. The description of the mausoleum's interior accurately reflects its structure, including the crypt, octagonal chamber, and the use of jalis for light and ventilation. The jalis are intricately carved screens that allow light to filter into the interior while maintaining privacy.  This use of jalis is a key feature of Indo-Islamic architecture.  The description highlights the architectural sophistication and the symbolic use of light within the mausoleum.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The other options are incorrect because they include statement 1, which contains an inaccurate description of the Taj Mahal's structure.

1.  The Jama Masjid in Mandu is characterized by its use of white marble, intricate pietra dura work, and towering minarets.
2.  Pathan architecture in Mandu is distinctly different from the architectural styles of Imperial Delhi, showcasing strong local traditions.
3.  The construction of the Taj Mahal involved approximately 20,000 specialized workers and took nearly twenty years to complete, starting in 1632.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jama Masjid in Mandu is primarily built with red sandstone, not white marble. Pietra dura, while a feature of Mughal architecture, is not a defining characteristic of the Jama Masjid in Mandu.  The mosque does have smaller domes, but not towering minarets in the style associated with later Mughal architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that Pathan architecture in Mandu is considered too close to the structures of Imperial Delhi, implying a lack of strong local traditions differentiating it significantly from Delhi's style.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage accurately describes the scale and duration of the Taj Mahal's construction, beginning in 1632 and involving a large workforce of specialized artisans.  The scale of the project highlights the resources and skill available to the Mughal empire at its height.


**3. With reference to the Jama Masjids of the medieval period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jama Masjid in Delhi served primarily as a place of worship, with minimal commercial or cultural activity in its surrounding areas.
2.  Medieval Indian Jama Masjids typically featured a large open courtyard, surrounded on three sides by cloisters, and a Qibla Liwan in the west.
3.  The Khutba, a sermon read during Friday prayers in Jama Masjids, was solely religious in nature, without any political implications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the Jama Masjid and its surroundings became a focal point for commercial and cultural exchange, in addition to religious practices. This signifies the mosque's broader role in the social and economic life of the city.

Statement 2 is correct. The description accurately portrays the typical architectural layout of a medieval Indian Jama Masjid. The open courtyard, cloisters, and the Qibla Liwan (the prayer niche wall) are common features, reflecting both religious and practical considerations in the design.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Khutba, read during Friday prayers, not only conveyed religious messages but also included announcements and pronouncements from the ruler, thereby having significant political implications.  This demonstrates the intertwined nature of religious and political authority in medieval India.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  The other options are incorrect as they include statements that contain factually inaccurate information.


**4. With reference to the Mandu architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rani Rupmati's Pavilion is a single-story structure offering panoramic views of the Narmada Valley.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage describes Rani Rupmati's Pavilion as a *double* pavilion, not a single-story structure. This detail highlights the complexity of the building's design.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately notes the blend of Afghan architectural robustness and softer elements like lattice work and carved brackets in Hoshang Shah's Tomb. This reflects the syncretic nature of architectural styles in Mandu.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Jahaz Mahal is described as having features similar to a mosque, but it is not explicitly identified as a mosque in the passage. It is described as having an open courtyard and smaller domes, but this does not make it a mosque.  The passage describes the Jama Masjid as the large-scale mosque.


**5. With reference to the Gol Gumbad, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gol Gumbad, despite being unfinished, stands as a testament to the grandeur and majesty of Indo-Islamic architecture.
2.  The Gol Gumbad's construction utilized locally sourced materials, reflecting a preference for regional resources in its construction.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage mentions the Gol Gumbad's unfinished state yet highlights its symbolic representation of grandeur and majesty within Indo-Islamic architecture.  This showcases the impact of the structure despite its incomplete condition.

Statement 2 cannot be verified from the provided text. While the passage discusses the use of local materials in other contexts, it does not provide information about the Gol Gumbad's construction materials.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation of the correct answer and why the other options are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following statements about medieval Indian art:**

1.  The "lost-wax" process, also known as cire-perdu, was a bronze casting technique used primarily in South India during the medieval period.
2.  The Pala style of sculpture, prevalent in eastern India during the 9th-11th centuries, is characterized by a distinct regional style that heavily borrowed from the Gupta style.
3.  The Vijayanagara style of painting, evident in temples like those at Tiruparakunram and Lepakshi, featured figures predominantly shown in profile against flat backgrounds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the "lost-wax" process was indeed a crucial technique for bronze casting in India, its usage wasn't limited to South India during the medieval period.  It was employed across various regions, including North India and the Deccan,  from ancient times (Indus Valley Civilization) to the medieval period and beyond.  The statement wrongly restricts its geographical scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The Pala style, named after the Pala dynasty of Bengal and Bihar, flourished from the 9th to 11th centuries. Although it drew inspiration from the earlier Gupta style, it developed its own distinct regional characteristics in terms of facial features, body proportions, and drapery styles. The statement accurately reflects this stylistic evolution and regional context.

Statement 3 is correct. The Vijayanagara style of painting, which extended into the Nayaka period, is characterized by its use of profile views for figures against flat, two-dimensional backgrounds.  The examples cited in the text, Tiruparakunram and Lepakshi, clearly demonstrate this stylistic convention. The statement correctly identifies this key feature of the artistic tradition.


**2. With reference to the iconography and stylistic features of Indian bronze sculptures, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chola bronze sculptures, renowned for their exquisite detail and aesthetic appeal, primarily depicted Buddhist deities.
2.  The "Dancing Girl" from Mohenjo-daro is considered the earliest known bronze sculpture in India, dating back to 2500 BCE.
3.  Gupta and Vakataka bronze images of the Buddha, often portable, contributed to the dissemination of the classical style across India and beyond.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Chola bronzes are indeed famous for their artistry, they primarily depicted Hindu deities, particularly Shiva and his consort Parvati, along with other figures from Hindu mythology.  The statement misrepresents the religious context of Chola bronze sculpture.

Statement 2 is correct. The "Dancing Girl" bronze figurine from Mohenjo-daro is widely accepted as one of the earliest examples of bronze sculpture in India, dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization (2500 BCE). The statement correctly identifies this significant artifact and its chronological importance.

Statement 3 is correct. The Gupta and Vakataka periods (5th-7th centuries CE) produced refined bronze images of the Buddha, which were often portable and facilitated the spread of the classical style throughout India and to other parts of Asia. Monks carried these portable images, contributing to the wider dissemination of artistic styles.


**3. With reference to the architectural styles of medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nagara style of temple architecture, predominantly found in North India, is characterized by a pyramidal tower called a *vimana*.
2.  The Dravida style, prevalent in South India, features a curvilinear spire known as a *shikhara* and is often enclosed within a compound wall.
3.  Hoysala temples, exhibiting a unique hybrid style, are distinguished by their stellate ground plans and intricate carvings, as seen in temples at Halebid and Belur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The *vimana* is the pyramidal tower characteristic of Dravidian temple architecture, not Nagara.  Nagara temples are characterized by a curvilinear spire called a *shikhara*. The statement confuses the defining features of the two styles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The *shikhara*, the curvilinear spire, is a defining feature of Nagara architecture, not Dravida.  Dravidian temples have a pyramidal *vimana*. The statement incorrectly attributes the *shikhara* to the Dravida style.

Statement 3 is correct. Hoysala temples (12th-14th centuries CE) in Karnataka represent a distinct hybrid style, blending elements of Nagara and Dravida traditions. Their stellate (star-shaped) ground plans and exceptionally detailed carvings are unique features, prominently displayed in temples at Halebid and Belur. The statement accurately describes the Hoysala architectural style and its key characteristics.


**4. With reference to the features of Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Qutub Minar, built in the 13th century, is a tapering tower primarily constructed of marble, showcasing intricate balconies and inscriptions.
2.  The use of pietra dura and tessellation techniques for surface decoration became prominent in Mughal architecture from the 16th century onwards.
3.  Sarais, built throughout the Indian subcontinent, served as temporary accommodations primarily for royal families and high-ranking officials.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Qutub Minar is indeed a tapering tower from the 13th century, it's primarily constructed from red sandstone and buff sandstone, not marble, although marble was used in the upper sections. The statement misrepresents the primary building material.

Statement 2 is correct.  Pietra dura (inlay work) and tessellation (mosaic designs) became significant decorative features in Mughal architecture, especially from the 16th century, adorning walls, dado panels, and other surfaces. The statement accurately reflects this decorative trend.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Sarais were public accommodations designed to provide temporary lodging for a wide range of travelers, including merchants, pilgrims, and ordinary people, not exclusively for royalty and officials. The statement incorrectly restricts the user base of Sarais.


**5. With reference to the cave art and architecture of Post-Mauryan India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ajanta caves, renowned for their paintings, contain only Buddhist chaitya caves, dating back to the second and first centuries BCE.
2.  The vihara caves at Nashik, characterized by their facade designs with pillars and ghata-bases, are among the most significant examples of early vihara architecture.
3.  Ellora caves uniquely house Buddhist, Brahmanical, and Jain monuments, showcasing a remarkable confluence of religious traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Ajanta caves include both chaitya (prayer halls) and vihara (monasteries) caves. While some early caves date back to the second and first centuries BCE, others are from later periods (5th-6th centuries CE).  The statement is too restrictive in its dating and categorization.

Statement 2 is correct.  The vihara caves at Nashik, particularly their distinctive facade designs incorporating pillars, ghata-bases, and ghata-capitals, are considered important examples of early vihara architecture in western India.  The statement accurately highlights their architectural significance.

Statement 3 is correct. Ellora caves stand out for their remarkable combination of Buddhist, Hindu (Brahmanical), and Jain monuments, representing a unique synthesis of religious architectural traditions in a single location.  The statement correctly identifies this unique feature of Ellora.


These questions demand specific factual recall, analysis of architectural styles, and understanding of religious and cultural contexts, aligning with the requirements of a challenging UPSC-style examination.  The distractors are carefully designed to test a candidate’s in-depth knowledge and ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**1. With reference to Indo-Islamic architecture in Mandu, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama Masjid in Mandu, built for Friday prayers, features a monumental gateway, an open courtyard, and columned cloisters, all faced with red sandstone.
2. Mandu's Pathan architecture is characterized by a robust and austere style, distinct from the Imperial Delhi style, with surface embellishments like jalis and carved brackets.
3. The Jahaz Mahal in Mandu, completed in 1652, took approximately twenty years to build and employed over 20,000 specialized workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Jama Masjid in Mandu is described in the text as having the features mentioned, including red sandstone facing.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage states that Mandu's Pathan architecture is considered "too close to the structures of Imperial Delhi," contradicting the claim of a distinct style.  Statement 3 is partially correct. While the Jahaz Mahal's construction took roughly twenty years and employed a large workforce, the completion date mentioned in the text is from 1632 onwards, suggesting the completion date may be around 1652, not 1652 itself.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are largely correct, making (b) the appropriate answer.  The slight discrepancy in the Jahaz Mahal's completion date doesn't invalidate the core information about its construction timeline and workforce.


**2. With reference to the Taj Mahal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Taj Mahal's sublimity arises from its symmetrical design, the use of ethereal white marble, its location within a chahar bagh, and its visual contrast against the sky.
2. The Taj Mahal complex, built by Shah Jahan for Mumtaz Mahal, features a red sandstone gateway that frames the mausoleum and flanking structures of similar red sandstone to maintain balance.
3. The Taj Mahal's interior features a crypt below and an octagonal tomb chamber above, illuminated by carved and perforated jalis, and embellished with stone carvings, jalis, arabesques in pietra dura, and Quranic calligraphy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect details about the Taj Mahal provided in the text. Statement 1 correctly identifies the key elements contributing to the Taj Mahal's aesthetic appeal: symmetry, the use of white marble, its setting in a chahar bagh, and its silhouette against the sky. Statement 2 accurately describes the complex's entrance and the use of red sandstone in contrast to the white marble mausoleum.  Statement 3 correctly describes the interior layout, including the crypt, the octagonal chamber, the use of jalis for illumination, and the various decorative elements employed. Thus, option (d) is correct.


**3. With reference to the architectural features of the Jama Masjid, consider the following statements:**

1.  Medieval Indian Jama Masjids typically accommodated at least forty adult Muslim men for Friday prayers, where a Khutba was read, outlining the ruler's laws.
2.  The typical Jama Masjid layout included a large open courtyard, surrounded on three sides by cloisters (Liwan), with the Qibla Liwan housing the mihrab and mimbar.
3.  The Jama Masjid in Delhi, a large mosque, exemplifies the focus of community life in medieval times, serving as a center for commercial, cultural, religious, and indirect political activities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are supported by the provided text. Statement 1 accurately describes the minimum capacity and the ritualistic reading of the Khutba in the Jama Masjid. Statement 2 correctly outlines the typical architectural layout of a Jama Masjid in medieval India, mentioning the courtyard, cloisters, and the placement of the mihrab and mimbar. Statement 3 accurately reflects the mosque's significance as a focal point for various aspects of community life, beyond just religious functions.  Therefore, (c) is the correct option.



**4. With reference to Nagara temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Latina or rekha-prasada type of shikhara is a simple, tall tower with a square base and inward-curving walls rising to a point.
2. The Phamsana type of Nagara building is characterized by a broader, shorter structure with a roof composed of several slabs rising gently to a single point.
3. The Valabhi type of Nagara building is a rectangular structure with a wagon-vaulted roof, resembling ancient bamboo or wooden wagons, often used for mandapas in North Indian temples.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the Latina/rekha-prasada and Phamsana shikhara types, respectively. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Valabhi type is indeed described as a rectangular building with a wagon-vaulted roof,  the text clearly states that the Phamsana design is used for mandapas,  not the Valabhi type.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making (a) the correct answer. The description of the Valabhi style is accurate, but its association with mandapas in the question is misleading.


**5. With reference to the Dashavatara Temple at Deogarh, consider the following statements:**

1.  Built in the early sixth century CE, the Dashavatara Temple at Deogarh is a panchayatana-style temple with a curvilinear shikhara.
2. The temple features three main Vishnu reliefs: Sheshashayana on the south, Nara-Narayan on the east, and Gajendramoksha on the west, and is west-facing.
3. The four subsidiary shrines of the Dashavatara Temple are definitively known to have housed Vishnu's avatars, making it a true dasavatara temple.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The text explicitly states the temple's construction date, panchayatana style, curvilinear shikhara, and the location and depiction of the three Vishnu reliefs.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that it is *not* definitively known to whom the four subsidiary shrines were dedicated. It was *assumed* they housed Vishnu's avatars, but this assumption was incorrect. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate, making (a) the correct choice. The uncertainty regarding the subsidiary shrines acts as a key distractor.


**6.  With reference to Khajuraho temples, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lakshmana Temple, dedicated to Vishnu, is Khajuraho's grandest temple, built in 954 CE by the Chandela king Dhanga, featuring four smaller corner temples and high, curved pyramidal shikharas.
2. Khajuraho temples are renowned for their extensive erotic sculptures, where erotic expression is given equal importance to spiritual pursuit within a cosmic whole.
3. The Kandariya Mahadeo Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, predates the tenth century and is composed of small, square shrines of roughly-hewn granite blocks, associated with the cult of the Yoginis.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of the Lakshmana Temple and the overall characteristic of Khajuraho's sculptures.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Kandariya Mahadeo Temple is *another* notable example at Khajuraho, dedicated to Shiva, but it *does not* predate the tenth century; rather, the Chausanth Yogini Temple is described as predating the tenth century.  The description of the Kandariya Mahadeo Temple's characteristics is attributed to the wrong temple. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making (a) the correct answer.  The incorrect attribution in statement 3 is a significant distractor.


**7. With reference to the Sun Temple at Modhera, consider the following statements:**

1. Built in 1026 CE by Raja Bhimdev I of the Solanki dynasty, the Sun Temple at Modhera features a massive rectangular stepped tank (surya kund) in front.
2. The Sun Temple's sabha mandapa (assembly hall) is open on all sides, reflecting the architectural fashion of western and central Indian temples of the time.
3. The Sun Temple's central shrine, devoid of carving, faces east, allowing the sun's rays to shine directly into it during the equinoxes, highlighting the influence of the woodcarving tradition of Gujarat.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the information given in the text about the Sun Temple at Modhera. Statement 1 correctly identifies the builder, date, and the presence of the surya kund. Statement 2 correctly describes the open-sided sabha mandapa. Statement 3 correctly notes the lack of carving on the central shrine's walls, its eastward orientation for sunlight during equinoxes, and implicitly acknowledges the influence of Gujarati woodcarving traditions (though not explicitly stating "influence").

Statement 1 is accurate. The Jama Masjid in Mandu indeed possesses the described architectural features.  The monumental gateway, squat dome, and open courtyard with columned cloisters are defining characteristics of its design. This showcases the typical features of Indo-Islamic architecture of that period.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that Mandu's Pathan architecture is considered "too close to the structures of Imperial Delhi," indicating a lack of bold local traditions in its architectural expression.  While regional variations existed, the overall style was heavily influenced by the architectural trends of Delhi.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Jahaz Mahal is mentioned in the provided text.  While the text doesn't explicitly detail a blend of Pathan and Rajput styles, its inclusion alongside other Mandu structures suggests its significance within the region's architectural landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While royal patronage was a significant factor, the text suggests that Jama Masjids were focal points of both religious and commercial life, implying contributions from a wider range of sources beyond just the ruler. This points to a more complex funding model than simply royal patronage.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that the Khutba included pronouncements of the ruler's laws, demonstrating its political significance in addition to its religious function. This shows that the Khutba served a dual purpose as a religious and political tool.


**4. With reference to the Gol Gumbad, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gol Gumbad was completed in 1656, taking approximately 20 years and the labor of 20,000 specialized workers.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the construction of the Gol Gumbad took nearly twenty years (from 1632 onwards), involved 20,000 specialized workers, and its completion date is implied in the text. This demonstrates a large-scale project requiring significant manpower and time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text argues that despite being unfinished, the Gol Gumbad *symbolizes* the grandeur and majesty of Indo-Islamic architecture. The unfinished state is not presented as a negative factor diminishing its significance. This highlights the ability of a monument to retain its symbolic power even in an incomplete state.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text describes the Gol Gumbad's dome as having a double-dome construction to achieve its high ceiling and create the large void space. The absence of internal supports is not explicitly mentioned. This reveals a complex structural design to achieve the dome's impressive size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

This showcases the evolution of rock-cut techniques and architectural ambition. Ajanta's double-storeyed caves are impressive, but Ellora's three-tiered structures represent a higher level of engineering and artistic achievement.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explicitly states the evolution of pillar design from Buddhist to Jain caves, highlighting the increasing ornamentation and protrusion in later Jain examples. This reflects a stylistic shift and the influence of evolving aesthetic preferences across religious traditions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While many Ellora caves (Nos. 13-28) are dedicated to Shaivism, the text explicitly mentions that the images of *both* Shiva and Vishnu, along with their various forms, are depicted. This demonstrates a degree of religious syncretism and artistic inclusivity within the Brahmanical caves of Ellora, contradicting the statement’s claim of Shaivism as the sole focus.

The text directly states that various guilds from different regions (Vidarbha, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu) participated in carving the sculptures at Ellora, contributing to the site's remarkable diversity of styles. This highlights the collaborative nature of the artistic endeavor and the geographical reach of the artisans involved.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage clearly identifies Cave No. 16 (Kailash Leni) as a rock-cut temple carved from a single rock, and further emphasizes this as a *unique* achievement of the artisans.  The statement contradicts the text's explicit description of the cave's construction and significance.


**3. With reference to the post-sixth-century development of Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1.  The development of art after the sixth century CE depended heavily on political patronage, unlike the earlier periods which relied more on collective public patronage.

This reflects a shift in the social and economic dynamics supporting artistic production.  The change in patronage directly influenced the nature and scale of artistic endeavors.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage highlights the existence of terracotta figurines across India, showcasing a tradition parallel to religious lithic sculptures and independent regional styles.  This indicates a diverse and widespread artistic practice encompassing both religious and secular themes.  The terracotta tradition provides valuable insights into the broader cultural landscape.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions the continuation of the rock-cut cave tradition in Karnataka (Badami and Aihole), Andhra Pradesh (Vijayawada area), and Tamil Nadu (Mahabalipuram), contradicting the statement's assertion of its absence in these regions.  The presence of rock-cut caves in these areas demonstrates the geographical spread and persistence of this architectural style.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifically states that the Mahabodhi Temple's design is unusual and is neither purely Dravida nor Nagara.  This indicates a unique blend of architectural elements, defying simple categorization within the established styles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text dates the vedika around the Bodhi tree to the post-Mauryan period (around 100 BCE), not the 8th-century Pala period.  The Pala period is associated with sculptures within the temple's niches, not the vedika itself.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly states that many sculptures in the temple's niches are dated to the post-Mauryan period (around 100 BCE). This indicates the temple's long history and the accumulation of artistic contributions across different periods.  This detail underscores the temple's layered history and evolution.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Hoysala temple architecture:**

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly describes Hoysala temples as a hybrid or Vesara style, indicating a unique blend of Dravida and Nagara elements.  They are not exclusively categorized under either of the established styles.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage describes the creation of the stellate plan in Hoysala temples by cutting out angular projections from an initial square plan. This process results in the star-like shape that characterizes this architectural style.  The description accurately reflects the geometric evolution of the temple design.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that the Halebid temple is a *double* building with a large mandapa (hall) designed to facilitate music and dance, contradicting the statement's claim of a single structure lacking subsidiary halls.  The presence of the mandapa highlights the temple's functional design for religious and cultural activities.

While fragments survive, describing them as showcasing a "continuation" of the Ajanta tradition might be considered an oversimplification. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct. The other options are incorrect, either including the partially inaccurate statement or omitting the entirely accurate ones.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.

**1. With reference to the architectural features of Indo-Islamic monuments in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The use of pietra dura, a technique involving the inlay of precious stones, was predominantly featured in the dado panels of Mughal-era buildings.
2.  High relief carving, creating a three-dimensional effect, was a common decorative element, especially noticeable in the spandrels of arches.
3.  The prevalence of jalis (lattice screens) was a unique feature of Indo-Islamic architecture, absent in earlier Indian architectural traditions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Pietra dura was indeed a significant decorative element in Indo-Islamic architecture, notably used in dado panels (the lower part of a wall) of many Mughal buildings.  The Taj Mahal is a prime example of this technique’s exquisite application.

Statement 2 is also correct. High relief carving was a prominent feature, adding depth and visual interest to the architectural surfaces.  This technique was used extensively in various parts of structures, including the spandrels (the triangular space between the curve of an arch and the rectangular frame enclosing it).

Statement 3 is incorrect. While jalis became a more prominent and refined feature in Indo-Islamic architecture, their use wasn't entirely absent in earlier Indian architectural traditions.  Various forms of latticework and screens existed in pre-Islamic Indian architecture, though perhaps not as extensively or with the same level of intricacy.


**2. With reference to the construction materials and techniques used in Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rubble masonry, a readily available material, formed the core of most building walls, later encased in dressed stone or chunam plaster.
2.  The use of bricks in construction became widespread only after the 17th century, contributing to greater structural flexibility.
3.  The extensive use of polychrome tiles for wall finishing was a characteristic feature introduced by the early Mughal emperors.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The construction process typically involved a robust core of rubble masonry for the walls, providing structural strength. This was then overlaid with finer materials like dressed stone or chunam (a type of lime plaster) for a more polished finish.

Statement 2 is also correct. While stone was initially the primary building material, the increased use of bricks from the 17th century onwards significantly impacted the design and construction techniques, allowing for greater flexibility in architectural forms.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Polychrome tiles were used extensively, but their introduction wasn't limited to the early Mughals.  Their use evolved and became more widespread over time, incorporating different styles and techniques.


**3. With reference to the strategic aspects of medieval Indian forts, consider the following statements:**

1.  The capture of a fort often symbolized the complete loss of power or sovereignty of the vanquished ruler.
2.  Forts were primarily constructed on plains to maximize accessibility and ease of defense.
3.  Concentric circles of outer walls, as seen in Golconda Fort, were a common defensive feature to delay enemy advances.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  In medieval warfare, the control of a fort was crucial.  Losing a fort often meant a significant loss of territory, resources, and ultimately, political power.  The ruler's legitimacy and authority were heavily tied to the possession of such strategic locations.

Statement 3 is also correct.  The concentric wall design was a sophisticated defensive strategy used in many forts, including Golconda.  This design forced the attacking army to breach multiple layers of defense, slowing their advance and giving the defenders time to prepare.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Forts were strategically located on commanding heights, offering better visibility, security, and a natural defensive advantage.  Building on plains would have been tactically unwise, exposing the fort to easier attacks.

1.  The Qutub Minar, primarily constructed of red and buff sandstone, incorporated marble in its upper storeys.
2.  The Chand Minar, initially decorated with chevron patterning on encaustic tiles, is now painted peach.
3.  Minars primarily served as watchtowers for military surveillance and observation of the surrounding areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Qutub Minar's construction involved a combination of red and buff sandstone, with marble used in the upper levels. This reflects the typical use of readily available materials combined with more luxurious elements in prominent areas.

Statement 2 is also correct. The original decorative scheme of the Chand Minar included chevron patterning on encaustic tiles.  Over time, the original appearance has faded, and it is currently painted peach.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While minars might have had some secondary function in observation, their primary purpose was associated with the Islamic practice of the azaan (the call to prayer). The height of the minar symbolized the power and authority of the ruler.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Chola bronzes are renowned for their exquisite craftsmanship, utilizing the lost-wax casting method, and frequently displaying figures in the graceful *tribhanga* (triple bend) posture.  Statement 3 is also correct;  while many Chola bronzes depict major deities, a notable number also feature female figures like *yakshinis* (female nature spirits) and *Shasanadevis* (female attendants of Tirthankaras), reflecting the broader religious and cultural context. However, statement 2 is incorrect. While Chola bronzes *were* discovered in Nagapattinam,  their dating is primarily to the 10th century CE, not the 12th century. The claim that Nagapattinam holds the majority of Chola bronzes is also an overstatement; significant numbers are found across Tamil Nadu and in museum collections nationally and internationally.  The other options are incorrect as they include the factually inaccurate statement 2.


**3. With reference to the Nagara style of temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho, a prime example of the *latina* or *rekha-prasada* type of *shikhara* within the Nagara style, built during the specified period and by the mentioned king. Statement 2 is also correct; the *phamsana* style, with its distinctive roof design, is indeed frequently used for *mandapas* in North Indian temple complexes.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Sun Temple at Konark, while a magnificent Nagara-style temple, does not belong to the *valabhi* type.  The *valabhi* type is characterized by a wagon-vaulted roof, distinctly different from Konark’s towering and curvilinear *shikhara*. Konark's architectural features align more closely with other Nagara subtypes.  The other options are incorrect because they either omit a correct statement or include the false statement regarding Konark's architectural classification.


**4. With reference to the Dravida style of temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram, built during the reign of Narasimhavarman II, features a single main shrine dedicated to Vishnu.

3.  Dravida temples are typically enclosed within a compound wall, featuring a central entrance gateway known as a *gopuram*, often adorned with elaborate sculptures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, highlighting its scale and defining architectural features.  Statement 3 correctly identifies the characteristic features of Dravida temples: the compound wall, the *gopuram* gateway, and the typically extensive sculptural decoration. However, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram, while a significant Pallava structure, houses *three* shrines—two dedicated to Shiva and one to Vishnu (as Anantashayana)—not just a single Vishnu shrine. This multi-shrine arrangement contradicts the statement's claim. The other options are incorrect because they either include the false statement about the Shore Temple or exclude the accurate descriptions of the Brihadisvara Temple and the general features of Dravida temples.

3. The Ajanta caves, featuring both chaitya and vihara types, have a precisely established chronology based on numerous dated inscriptions within the caves themselves.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Elephanta Caves, highlighting their religious evolution and the stylistic features of their sculptures.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bagh caves do possess a regional character, to claim it's significantly different from other Indian cave styles is an oversimplification.  Many stylistic links and overlaps exist with caves in other regions.  Statement 3 is also incorrect.  A precise chronology for Ajanta caves is *not* established due to a scarcity of dated inscriptions;  dating relies heavily on stylistic analysis and comparisons with other sites, leading to some uncertainty in the exact timeline. The other options are incorrect because they either include the inaccurate statements about Bagh and Ajanta or omit the correct description of the Elephanta Caves.


**8. With reference to  temple architecture in different regions of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Temples in Central India, primarily constructed of sandstone, often feature modest shrines with four pillars supporting a small mandapa and a garbhagriha.
2. The Dashavatara Temple at Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh, exemplifies the panchayatana style of architecture, with five shrines arranged in a square pattern.
3.  The temples of Odisha are characterized by the *deul* (shikhara) that curves sharply inward only near the top, preceded by a *jagamohana* (mandapa).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

2. The Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid, dedicated to Shiva as Nataraja, features a double building with a large mandapa for music and dance.
3.  The unique style of Hoysala temples is definitively classified as either Dravida or Nagara, reflecting a clear adherence to one of the established architectural traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Hoysala temples are renowned for their stellate (star-like) plan, a result of numerous projecting angles extending from a central square. The use of soapstone, a relatively soft stone, allowed for the creation of highly detailed and intricate carvings, particularly noticeable in the ornamentation of deities and their jewelry.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid is a prime example of Hoysala architecture.  Its dedication to Shiva as Nataraja is significant, and the temple's unique feature is its double structure, including a spacious mandapa designed to accommodate musical performances and dance.  The presence of Nandi pavilions further enhances its religious significance.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Hoysala architecture shares elements with both Dravida and Nagara styles, it's not definitively classified as either. It's often described as a hybrid or Vesara style, reflecting a unique blend of influences rather than a strict adherence to a single tradition. This hybrid nature is a key characteristic that distinguishes Hoysala temples from other medieval structures.


**2. With reference to Vijayanagara architecture and its influences, consider the following statements:**

1. Vijayanagara architecture demonstrates a synthesis of Dravida temple architecture with significant influences from contemporary European architectural styles.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Vijayanagara architecture is a fascinating blend of Dravida traditions and Islamic styles prevalent in neighboring sultanates.  While European travelers visited, their architectural impact on Vijayanagara structures is minimal compared to the dominant indigenous and Islamic influences.

Statement 2 is correct.  Vijayanagara attracted numerous foreign travelers, including Italians, Portuguese, and Afghans. Their detailed accounts of the city's grandeur, bustling markets, and impressive architecture provide invaluable historical and cultural insights into the kingdom. These accounts are a primary source for understanding Vijayanagara's wealth and cosmopolitan nature.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Vijayanagara sculpture, although fundamentally derived from Chola ideals, does show occasional traces of foreign influences.  The cosmopolitan nature of the kingdom and its interactions with diverse cultures are reflected in its art, demonstrating a degree of cultural exchange and fusion.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Ajanta primarily features Buddhist caves and Ellora includes significant Jain caves, both sites also contain structures associated with other religious traditions. Ellora, in particular, is famous for its coexistence of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain cave temples, demonstrating the religious diversity and syncretism of the era.

Statement 2 is correct.  Ellora serves as a striking example of religious harmony and coexistence. The presence of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain monuments within the same complex underscores the religious pluralism and tolerance of the period.  This coexistence is a significant aspect of Indian history and architectural heritage.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Nalanda University, while a predominantly Buddhist center, embraced a wider range of Buddhist doctrines, including Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana.

1.  The Dravida temple style is characterized by a curving shikhara, similar to the Nagara style.
2.  The Nagara temple style typically includes a gopuram, a monumental gateway tower.
3.  The Vesara temple style is a hybrid style found in regions like Karnataka, incorporating elements of both Nagara and Dravida styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dravida temple style is distinguished by its stepped pyramid-like vimana, which contrasts sharply with the curvilinear shikhara of the Nagara style. The vimana's geometric form is a key defining characteristic of Dravida architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The gopuram, a monumental gateway tower, is a characteristic feature of Dravida temples, not Nagara temples.  Nagara temples typically have a more modest entrance structure.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Kashmiri architecture exhibits significant influence from Gandhara traditions, particularly due to its proximity to Gandhara sites and the movement of Buddhist monks and Brahmin pundits between these regions. This interaction led to a blend of architectural styles and religious influences.

2.  The Brahmanical caves (Nos. 13-28) at Ellora are primarily dedicated to Shaivism, but also depict images of Vishnu and his avatars.
3.  The Elephanta Caves, contemporary with Ellora, initially served as a Buddhist site before becoming dominated by Shaivite faith.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Ellora and Elephanta cave complexes.  Cave No. 12 at Ellora is indeed a remarkable triple-storeyed structure, showcasing a unique blend of Buddhist iconography, including Tara and Avalokiteshwara, along with various Buddha forms like Vairochana and Amitabha. This demonstrates the syncretic nature of religious beliefs during that period. The Brahmanical caves (13-28) at Ellora, while predominantly Shaivite, do incorporate Vaishnavite imagery, reflecting the religious pluralism of the time. The depiction of Shiva and Vishnu in various forms (like Gajasur Shiva, Kalyanasundara) highlights the complex interplay of different religious traditions within the same site.  Finally, the Elephanta Caves, known for their impressive Shaivite sculptures, did have Buddhist origins, indicating a shift in religious dominance over time. This transition underscores the fluidity of religious practices and the adaptation of sacred spaces throughout history.  The other options fail to capture the complete picture of these significant archaeological sites and their diverse religious representations.

3.  The Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves in Odisha, associated with Kharavela inscriptions, were primarily used by Buddhist monks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the prevalent architectural types of Buddhist caves in western India.  Ajanta and Karla caves exemplify the apsidal chaitya halls (prayer halls) with their characteristic curved ceilings and the quadrangular viharas (monasteries) with their flat roofs and numerous cells for monks. Statement 2 is also accurate. Guntapalle's unique feature is the coexistence of structured stupas, viharas, and rock-cut caves within the same site, showcasing a distinct architectural approach compared to other cave complexes. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves do have Kharavela inscriptions, these caves were predominantly used by Jain monks, not Buddhist monks, as evidenced by the inscriptions and the overall architectural style.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the religious affiliation of the Odisha caves or fail to include the accurate details about the unique features of Guntapalle.

Mathura sculptures during the Kushana period are indeed known for their relatively light volume, fleshy figures, and the distinctive style of draping the sanghati (monk's robe) over one shoulder, leaving the other shoulder bare. This stylistic feature is a key identifier of Mathura art. The Gandhara school, situated in the northwest, displays a clear Greco-Roman influence, resulting in Buddha images with curly hair, prominent eyeballs, and elongated earlobes—features quite different from those seen in other parts of India.  Finally, the Sarnath school, flourishing during the late Gupta period, is celebrated for its elegant, slender Buddha figures, characterized by a refined treatment of drapery that appears almost transparent, creating an effect of integrated volume.  The other options are incorrect as they fail to acknowledge the distinctive stylistic features of each school described in the statements.

Vijayanagara paintings, often adorning temple walls, are indeed recognized for their use of profile faces, two-dimensional representation of figures, and the organization of compositions within clearly defined rectilinear compartments. This stylistic convention contributed significantly to the development of later mural traditions. Nayaka paintings, which succeeded the Vijayanagara style, continued to depict scenes from major epics like the Mahabharata and Ramayana, also incorporating themes from Krishna Leela. This continuity, with regional variations, is a key aspect of the evolution of South Indian painting.  Kerala murals, developed from the 16th to 18th centuries, uniquely incorporated elements from performance art forms like Kathakali and the calligraphic style of Kalam Ezhuthu.  They are distinguished by their vibrant colors and a greater emphasis on three-dimensionality in their figures, setting them apart from the flatter style of the Vijayanagara and Nayaka schools.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to capture the full range of stylistic features and thematic content of these painting traditions.

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tabo Monastery is situated in Himachal Pradesh, not Arunachal Pradesh.  While it does exhibit a mix of architectural styles, attributing it solely to a blend of Tibetan and Indian styles overlooks other influences.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ellora caves are a remarkable example of religious syncretism, housing Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain monuments within a single complex. This coexistence reflects the diverse religious landscape of the region during the period of their construction.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Nalanda University was a significant architectural complex, far beyond simple monastic structures.  While much of it remains unexcavated, the existing remains demonstrate a complex of monasteries of varying sizes, reflecting a substantial architectural undertaking.  The scale and complexity of Nalanda refute the assertion of simple structures.



**4. With reference to the sculptural traditions of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nalanda school of sculpture, emerging in the 9th century, heavily relied on the Gupta style of Mathura.
2.  The sculptures at Ellora, created by diverse guilds from various regions, demonstrate a homogenous style.
3.  The colossal sculpture of Ravana shaking Mount Kailasha at Ellora's Kailashnath temple is dated to the 8th century CE.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nalanda school of sculpture, flourishing from the 9th century onwards, drew significantly from the earlier Gupta style, particularly that of Sarnath and Mathura. This influence is evident in the sculptures' forms and stylistic elements, though the Nalanda school also developed its distinctive features.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The sculptures at Ellora, far from exhibiting a homogenous style, are characterized by their remarkable diversity.  The involvement of various guilds from different regions (Vidarbha, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu) resulted in a rich blend of sculptural styles, reflecting the region's multicultural character.

Statement 3 is correct. The colossal sculpture of Ravana shaking Mount Kailasha, located within Ellora's Kailashnath temple (Cave 16), is indeed dated to the 8th century CE.  This monumental work is considered a masterpiece of Indian sculpture, renowned for its scale and intricate details.


**5. With reference to temple architecture in different regions of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Odisha temples, characterized by their rekhapida, pidhadeul, and khakra styles, are exclusively Dravidian in origin.
2. The Sun Temple at Konark, built around 1240 CE, originally had a 70-meter-high shikhara that later collapsed.
3.  The Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho, built in 954 CE, is a Dravidian temple known for its extensive erotic sculptures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Odisha temples have unique features classified into rekhapida, pidhadeul, and khakra styles, they belong to the Nagara order, not the Dravidian order.  The Dravidian style is predominantly found in South India, whereas the Nagara style is prevalent in North and East India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sun Temple at Konark, constructed around 1240 CE, did indeed possess a colossal shikhara that reached approximately 70 meters. This structure, however, proved too heavy for its foundation and eventually collapsed in the 19th century.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho, built in 954 CE, is a Nagara-style temple, not Dravidian.  While it is renowned for its extensive erotic sculptures, this feature is not unique to a particular architectural style but is found in several temples across different regions and styles.  The architectural style of the Lakshmana Temple is distinctly Nagara.


**6. With reference to bronze sculpture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Dancing Girl" from Mohenjodaro represents the earliest known example of bronze sculpture in India, dating back to 2500 BCE.
2.  Gupta and post-Gupta period bronzes, particularly in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, often depict standing Buddhas with a distinct drapery style.
3.  The lost-wax casting technique, used for bronze sculptures, originated in the Mughal period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "Dancing Girl" bronze from Mohenjodaro is indeed considered one of the earliest known bronze sculptures in India, dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization (approximately 2500 BCE).  Its stylistic features and the advanced metalworking techniques employed demonstrate a high level of craftsmanship.

Statement 2 is correct.  Bronze sculptures from the Gupta and post-Gupta periods (5th-7th centuries CE) in regions like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar frequently depict standing Buddhas. These sculptures are characterized by a refined style, including the treatment of drapery, which often drapes over the shoulders and falls in graceful folds.  The stylistic variations within this period are notable.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The lost-wax casting technique, also known as the cire-perdu process, predates the Mughal period by millennia.  Evidence suggests its use in India dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization and continued throughout various historical periods.  The Mughal period did not introduce this technique.


**7. With reference to the Nagara temple style, consider the following statements:**

1. The latina or rekha-prasada type of shikhara is characterized by a square base and gently sloping walls curving inward to a point.
2.  The phamsana style, typically broader and shorter than the latina, features a roof composed of several slabs rising to a single point.
3. The valabhi type of Nagara temple is a circular structure with a dome-shaped roof.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The latina or rekha-prasada shikhara is a defining feature of the Nagara style.  Its form, with a square base and gently inward-curving walls culminating in a point, is a key element in identifying this architectural type.

Statement 2 is also correct. The phamsana style is another significant sub-type within the Nagara order.  Unlike the latina, it is typically broader and shorter, with a roof composed of several slabs that gradually ascend to a single central point.  The sloping, rather than curving, nature of the roof is a distinguishing feature.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The valabhi type of Nagara temple is rectangular, not circular.  It features a distinctive wagon-vaulted roof, resembling the shape of ancient bullock carts.  The rounded edge of the vaulted chamber is a key characteristic of this style.  The description in the statement confuses the valabhi with other architectural styles.


**8. With reference to Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama Masjid in Mandu is a large-scale mosque showcasing Pathan architectural features closely resembling those of Imperial Delhi.
2. The Taj Mahal's construction, completed in 1653, employed approximately 20,000 specialized workers over nearly two decades.
3. Gol Gumbad, despite being unfinished, exemplifies the grandeur of Indo-Islamic architecture through its massive scale and innovative acoustics.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that the Jama Masjid in Mandu is indeed a large mosque, but it's inaccurate to say its Pathan architectural features closely resemble those of Imperial Delhi. While there are similarities, Mandu's architecture possesses distinct regional characteristics. The statement oversimplifies the regional variations in Indo-Islamic architecture.

Statement 2 is correct. The construction of the Taj Mahal, completed around 1653, was a massive undertaking involving an estimated 20,000 specialized workers over a period spanning nearly two decades. The scale of the project and the specialized workforce highlight the immense resources dedicated to its creation.

Statement 3 is correct.  Gol Gumbad, even in its unfinished state, stands as a testament to the grandeur and ambition of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its massive dome and remarkable acoustic properties, even without full completion, showcase innovative architectural techniques and engineering skills.  The unfinished aspect does not diminish its architectural significance.




**1. With reference to Jain temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu, known for their simplistic exteriors and exuberant marble interiors, were constructed by Vimal Shah.
2. The tallest monolithic free-standing structure in the world, the Gomateshwara statue of Lord Bahubali at Sravana Belagola, was commissioned by a Ganga king of Mysore.
3.  The Akota hoard, a significant collection of Jain bronzes, dates back to the 10th-11th century CE and showcases the lost-wax casting technique.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dilwara temples at Mount Abu are indeed renowned for their striking contrast between simple exteriors and richly decorated marble interiors, and their construction is attributed to Vimal Shah.  The intricate sculptural decoration, with deep undercutting creating a lace-like effect, and unique ceiling patterns are hallmarks of these temples.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gomateshwara statue of Lord Bahubali at Sravana Belagola, a remarkable feat of monolithic sculpture, is indeed the world's tallest free-standing structure of its kind.  It was commissioned by Chamundaraya, the General-in-Chief and Prime Minister of the Ganga Kings of Mysore, reflecting the patronage of powerful figures in the promotion of religious art.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Akota hoard is a significant discovery of finely cast Jain bronzes made through the lost-wax process, often inlaid with silver and copper, its dating is between the end of the 5th and the end of the 7th century CE, not the 10th-11th century. This highlights the importance of precise chronological understanding in art history.  The error in the statement demonstrates a common pitfall in UPSC-style questions:  close but incorrect dates are used as distractors.


**2. With reference to Chola bronze sculptures, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chola bronzes, primarily produced during the 10th-12th centuries CE in Tamil Nadu, are renowned for their exquisite beauty and aesthetic appeal, often depicting Hindu deities.
2.  The lost-wax casting technique, a method also used in other regions of India, was not a significant factor in the production of Chola bronzes.
3. The widowed Chola queen, Sembiyan Maha Devi, was a prominent patron of bronze sculpture during the 10th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Chola bronzes are indeed celebrated for their exceptional artistry and aesthetic appeal. Produced primarily during the 10th-12th centuries CE in Tamil Nadu, they often depict Hindu deities with remarkable detail and grace, reflecting the high level of skill and sophistication achieved by Chola artisans.  Their popularity amongst collectors worldwide underscores their artistic significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The lost-wax casting technique was crucial to the production of Chola bronzes.  This technique, also used in other parts of India, demonstrates the continuity of metal casting traditions across different regions.  The question attempts to mislead by suggesting the technique was unimportant to the Chola bronze tradition.

Statement 3 is correct. Sembiyan Maha Devi, a widowed Chola queen, is recognized as an important patron of the arts during the 10th century. Her patronage highlights the role of influential women in shaping artistic production during this period. The inclusion of this fact tests knowledge of specific patrons and their impact on art history.


**3.  With reference to the rock-cut cave traditions of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ajanta caves in Maharashtra feature both chaitya (prayer halls) and vihara (monasteries) caves, with paintings and sculptures dating primarily to the 1st century BCE and 5th century CE.
2.  The Elephanta Caves near Mumbai, initially a Buddhist site, later became predominantly associated with Shaivism, showcasing a shift in religious patronage.
3. The Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves near Bhubaneswar, Odisha, are primarily associated with Buddhist monks, as evidenced by inscriptions of Kharavela kings.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ajanta caves are indeed famous for their combination of chaitya and vihara caves, decorated with both paintings and sculptures. While the dating spans a considerable period, the bulk of the surviving art dates to the periods mentioned.  The question attempts to mislead by focusing on precise dates which are subject to scholarly debate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Elephanta Caves initially had Buddhist origins, but later became strongly identified with Shaivism, reflecting a change in religious dominance over time. This highlights the dynamic nature of religious practices and their impact on artistic expression.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Udaigiri-Khandagiri caves are primarily associated with Jain monks, not Buddhist monks, as indicated by the inscriptions of Kharavela, a Jain king.  This statement plays on the geographical proximity of Jain and Buddhist sites in India, creating a plausible but incorrect association.


**4. With reference to Indian painting traditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vijayanagara paintings, flourishing in the 14th-16th centuries, are characterized by figures depicted in profile, arranged within rectilinear compartments, and a stylistic continuity with earlier traditions.
2.  Nayaka paintings, primarily from the 17th-18th centuries, represent an extension of the Vijayanagara style, showcasing regional variations and incorporating elements from other traditions such as Kathakali.
3. Kerala murals, distinct from the Nayaka style, emerged in the 16th-18th centuries, using luminous colours, three-dimensionality, and thematic content derived from local versions of Hindu epics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Vijayanagara paintings indeed showcase a distinctive style with profile views, rectilinear compositions, and a clear connection to preceding artistic conventions.  This demonstrates the evolution of artistic styles over time and the influence of established traditions.

Statement 2 is correct. Nayaka paintings are correctly identified as a continuation of the Vijayanagara style, but with regional adaptations and the assimilation of influences from other art forms, such as Kathakali.  This exemplifies the regional variations within broader artistic movements.

Statement 3 is correct. Kerala murals are accurately described as possessing a unique style distinct from the Nayaka tradition, employing vibrant colours, three-dimensionality, and thematic content rooted in local interpretations of Hindu mythology. This highlights the diversity of artistic expression across different regions of India.


**5. With reference to the development of Buddhist art in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amaravati stupa in Andhra Pradesh, with its narrative sculptures depicting events from the Buddha's life and Jataka tales, reached its peak development during the 3rd century BCE.
2.  The Mathura school of sculpture, known for its fleshy, rounded figures and ornate drapery in Buddha images, flourished during the Gupta period.
3. The Nalanda school of sculpture, showcasing a synthesis of Gupta, Bihar, and central Indian traditions, is characterized by its high-quality workmanship and three-dimensional figures.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Amaravati stupa reached its peak development during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, not the 3rd century BCE.  This showcases a common distractor technique in UPSC questions – using a close but incorrect date.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mathura did produce sculptures with fleshy figures, this style is more associated with the Kushana period rather than the Gupta period. The Gupta period saw a shift towards more refined and elegant styles.  The statement interchanges stylistic features and periods to create confusion.

Statement 3 is correct. The Nalanda school is accurately described as a synthesis of multiple regional traditions, noted for its high-quality workmanship and three-dimensional figures.  This statement tests knowledge of specific artistic schools and their characteristics.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the task (creating difficult, nuanced questions with plausible distractors), some explanations may be longer than others to fully justify the correct answer and address potential misconceptions.


**1. With reference to Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jahaz Mahal in Mandu exemplifies the integration of local building traditions with Imperial Delhi's architectural styles.
2. The Jama Masjid in Mandu features a monumental gateway topped with a squat dome and an open courtyard flanked by columned cloisters.
3. The construction of the Taj Mahal involved specialized workers and spanned approximately twenty years, commencing in 1632.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while the Mandu architecture shows influences from Imperial Delhi, the passage explicitly states that the Pathan architecture of Mandu is considered *too close* to Delhi's styles, implying a less pronounced local character than suggested in the statement.  The passage highlights the "robust, austere" nature of Mandu's architecture but doesn't posit a strong integration of local traditions in the Jahaz Mahal specifically.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage directly describes the Jama Masjid's features: a monumental gateway with a squat dome, an open courtyard, and three-sided columned cloisters, all topped with smaller domes.  This accurately reflects the architectural details.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly states that the Taj Mahal's construction took nearly twenty years and involved 20,000 specialized workers, beginning in 1632. This is a well-documented fact about the monument's creation.


**2. With reference to the Taj Mahal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Taj Mahal complex is laid out in a Charbagh plan, with the mausoleum positioned at the southern extremity to maximize river views.
2.  The main structure of the Taj Mahal is made of Makrana marble, contrasted with red sandstone used for the mosque and other surrounding structures.
3.  The interior of the Taj Mahal mausoleum features four types of embellishments: stone carvings, jalis, arabesques with pietra dura, and calligraphic inlay.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the mausoleum is located at the *northern* extremity of the Charbagh, not the southern, to take advantage of the river bank.  The Charbagh plan and its relationship to the river are accurately described, but the mausoleum's placement is misrepresented.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage specifically mentions the use of Makrana marble for the main tomb, contrasted with the red sandstone of the mosque and other buildings within the complex.  The source of the marble and the contrasting materials are accurately described.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage details four types of embellishments used in the Taj Mahal's interior and exterior: stone carvings (high and low relief), jalis, arabesques with pietra dura, and calligraphic inlay work with jasper. This aligns perfectly with the passage's description.


**3. With reference to the architectural features of large mosques in medieval India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jama Masjid in Delhi, like other large mosques of the period, included a Qibla Liwan in the west, housing the mihrab and mimbar.
2.  Friday afternoon congregational prayers in these mosques involved the reading of the Khutba, which included announcements of the ruler's laws.
3.  These mosques, typically featuring open courtyards surrounded by cloisters, served primarily as religious spaces with minimal socio-cultural significance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly describes the typical layout of a large mosque, including the Qibla Liwan in the west, containing the mihrab (prayer niche indicating the direction of Mecca) and the mimbar (pulpit for the Imam). This aligns with the description of the Jama Masjid in Delhi.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage states that during Friday prayers, a Khutba (sermon) was read, which included announcements of the ruler's laws. This highlights the mosque's role in disseminating political information.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the Jama Masjid and its surroundings were the focus of people's lives, both Muslim and non-Muslim, due to the concentration of commercial, cultural, religious, and indirect political activities.  This contradicts the statement's claim of minimal socio-cultural significance.


**4. With reference to Gol Gumbad, consider the following statements:**

1. Gol Gumbad, despite being unfinished, showcases the grandeur of Indo-Islamic architecture through its massive dome and innovative acoustic properties.
2.  The construction of Gol Gumbad, completed in 1656, involved extensive use of locally sourced materials, reflecting a shift towards regional building practices.
3. Gol Gumbad's octagonal shape and massive dome represent a unique departure from traditional Indo-Islamic architectural styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Although the text mentions the unfinished state of Gol Gumbad, it does highlight its grandeur and the use of architectural features that symbolize the majesty of Indo-Islamic architecture. The unique acoustic properties are implied by the description of the structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage does not provide information about the specific materials used in Gol Gumbad's construction or any shift towards regional building practices. The date of completion is mentioned, but not the materials used or regional sourcing.

Statement 3 is partially correct in that the octagonal shape is mentioned, but the statement goes too far in claiming a *unique* departure from traditional styles. While the immense dome is noteworthy, the passage doesn't claim it is entirely unprecedented within the architectural tradition.

(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage directly attributes the construction of the Dilwara temples at Mount Abu to Vimal Shah and describes their architectural features accurately.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage describes the Shatrunjay Hill temples as "imposing with scores of temples clustered together," directly contradicting the statement's claim of a single structure.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage mentions the discovery of a large hoard of Jain bronzes at Akota near Baroda, dating to the 5th-7th centuries CE, and explicitly states that they were made using the lost-wax casting technique.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the Hoysaleshvara Temple at Halebid, its construction material (dark schist stone), approximate date (1150 CE), double-building structure, and large mandapa hall.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that Hoysala temples are made of *soapstone*, a relatively soft stone, which allowed for the intricate carvings. The statement incorrectly mentions hard granite.


**11. With reference to the Chola temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, completed around 1009 CE by Rajaraja Chola, is the largest and tallest Indian temple, featuring a monolithic octagonal dome-shaped shikhara.
2. Chola temples often incorporated subsidiary shrines within the main temple tower or as separate structures, unlike the North Indian practice of multiple clustered shikharas.
3. The Shore Temple at Mahabalipuram, built during the reign of Narasimhavarman II, features a single main shrine dedicated to Shiva, reflecting the Chola's predominantly Shaivite faith.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage accurately describes the Brihadisvara Temple's size, date of completion, patron, and the monolithic nature of its shikhara.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage contrasts the Chola practice of incorporating subsidiary shrines with the North Indian tradition of multiple clustered shikharas.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the fundamental difference between Nagara and Dravida temple styles.  The Nagara style, with its characteristically curved shikhara, is a defining feature of North Indian temple architecture, while the Dravida style, with its stepped pyramidal vimana, is prominent in the South. Statement 2 correctly outlines the evolutionary progression of Hindu temple architecture. The simplest form began with a single, small garbhagriha, evolving over time to include larger mandapas for congregational worship and, in the Dravidian style, elaborate gopurams.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Panchayatana style is indeed a significant architectural design, it's not limited to South India.  Examples of Panchayatana temples are found in both North and Central India, demonstrating a wider geographical distribution than the statement suggests.

3.  The Jahaz Mahal in Mandu exhibits a distinctly regional style, heavily influenced by local traditions and deviating significantly from the architectural norms of the Delhi Sultanate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Taj Mahal as a prime example of Mughal architecture, showcasing a synthesis of various stylistic influences.  Its harmonious blend of Persian, Turkish, and Indian elements highlights the cross-cultural exchange prevalent during the Mughal era. Statement 2 correctly identifies the key features of the Jama Masjid in Delhi, which is representative of the architectural style favored during the Delhi Sultanate. The presence of a spacious courtyard, surrounding cloisters, and a prominently placed Qibla wall are all consistent with this architectural tradition. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Jahaz Mahal in Mandu, while possessing some regional characteristics, does not deviate significantly from the architectural norms of the Delhi Sultanate.  It retains many features common to other structures built during that period, demonstrating a closer adherence to the prevailing Imperial style than the statement suggests.  The Pathan architecture of Mandu, though displaying local embellishments, remains largely consistent with the Imperial style.


**1. With reference to Chola bronze sculptures, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola period, spanning the 10th to 12th centuries CE, witnessed the production of some of the most exquisite bronze statues in South India, particularly in Kumbakonam.

3. The renowned Nataraja bronze sculptures, depicting Shiva in a dynamic dance pose, were predominantly created during the Pallava period and later refined by Chola artisans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Chola period (10th-12th centuries CE) is indeed renowned for its highly refined bronze casting techniques and the production of exquisite bronze sculptures, with Kumbakonam emerging as a significant center for this art form.  The skill and artistry involved in creating these sculptures are still admired and studied today.

Statement 2 is also correct. Sembiyan Maha Devi, a widowed Chola queen of the 10th century, is historically documented as a significant patron of the arts, commissioning numerous bronze sculptures.  Her patronage played a crucial role in supporting and developing bronze casting during this period.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Nataraja sculptures are iconic examples of Chola bronze art, their evolution and development primarily occurred during the Chola period itself, not the Pallava period.  Although bronze casting existed during the Pallava period, the distinctive style and technical mastery seen in the Chola Nataraja sculptures represent a later refinement and peak of this art form.  Attributing the creation primarily to the Pallava period is a misconception.


**2. With reference to the Tribhanga pose in Indian art, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tribhanga pose, characterized by three bends in the body (waist, neck, and legs), is a distinctive feature of Indian classical dance and sculpture, symbolizing grace and fluidity.
2.  The Tribhanga pose is primarily associated with depictions of female deities and figures, rarely used for male representations in Indian art.
3.  Examples of the Tribhanga pose can be found in sculptures dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization, indicating its ancient origins and continuous use throughout Indian art history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Tribhanga pose, featuring three graceful bends in the body at the waist, neck, and legs, is a hallmark of Indian classical dance and sculpture. It represents a sophisticated artistic technique conveying elegance, movement, and a sense of rhythm. This pose is widely utilized to depict various deities and figures, showcasing the artist's mastery of form and expression.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Tribhanga pose is frequently used to depict female figures, it is not exclusively limited to them.  Male figures, especially deities like Avalokiteshvara, are also depicted using this pose, demonstrating its broader application in representing both genders.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate generalization.

Statement 3 is partially correct in the sense that the pose’s origins are ancient. However, while  the "Dancing Girl" from Mohenjo-daro exhibits a three-bend posture, attributing the fully developed Tribhanga pose to the Indus Valley Civilization is an overreach.  The fully realized Tribhanga pose as a stylistic convention evolved and matured over time, becoming a prominent feature of classical Indian art much later.


**3. With reference to the lost-wax process in bronze casting, consider the following statements:**

1. The lost-wax (cire-perdu) technique, known since the Indus Valley Civilization, involves creating a wax model, covering it in clay, melting the wax, and pouring molten metal into the resulting mold.
2. This method was primarily used for creating religious icons and sculptures, with little application in producing everyday objects.
3.  The lost-wax process is still practiced by tribal communities in various parts of India, demonstrating its enduring relevance and cultural significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only

This technique is a hallmark of ancient Indian metalworking.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the lost-wax process was extensively used to create religious icons and sculptures, its application was not limited to this. It was also used to cast various everyday objects, such as utensils for cooking, eating, and drinking.  The statement's narrow focus on religious items ignores the broader practical applications of this versatile technique.

Statement 3 is correct. The lost-wax method continues to be utilized by tribal communities in different regions of India, showcasing its enduring presence in traditional crafts.  This demonstrates the long-lasting legacy and cultural significance of this ancient technique, highlighting its continuous transmission across generations.


**4. With reference to Vijayanagara paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. Vijayanagara paintings, flourishing from the 14th to 16th centuries, are characterized by profile views of faces, two-dimensional figures, and rectilinear compositions within compartments.
2. The Virupaksha temple in Hampi features ceiling paintings depicting events from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, showcasing the artistic skill and narrative abilities of Vijayanagara painters.
3.  Vijayanagara painting style heavily borrowed from the earlier Pala school of Bengal, incorporating its distinct use of colours and stylistic conventions in its depictions of deities and mythical narratives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Vijayanagara paintings, prominent during the Vijayanagara Empire's reign (14th-16th centuries), exhibit specific stylistic features: profile views of faces, figures rendered in a two-dimensional manner, and compositions structured within clearly defined rectilinear compartments. This stylistic approach is a key characteristic distinguishing Vijayanagara art.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Virupaksha temple in Hampi, a significant site of the Vijayanagara Empire, does contain ceiling paintings that depict scenes from the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, as well as events from the empire's history. This illustrates the use of painting to record historical events and religious narratives.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Vijayanagara art certainly drew inspiration from preceding artistic traditions, attributing a major influence from the Pala school of Bengal is inaccurate. The Pala school's influence is largely confined to eastern India, while the Vijayanagara style developed independently in South India, drawing more directly from earlier South Indian painting traditions like the Chola and Nayaka styles.


**5. With reference to the architectural styles of Indian temples, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara style, prevalent in North India, features a curvilinear shikhara (tower), while the Dravida style, found in South India, is characterized by a pyramidal vimana (tower).
2.  The Vesara style represents a distinct fusion of Nagara and Dravida elements, showcasing a unique blend of architectural features from both traditions.
3.  The Hoysala temples of Karnataka, renowned for their intricate carvings, primarily exemplify the Nagara style, with minimal influence from the Dravida tradition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nagara and Dravida styles are indeed the two major architectural styles of Indian temples.  The Nagara style, found in North India, is characterized by its curvilinear shikharas, while the Dravida style, predominantly in South India, features pyramidal vimanas. These distinct forms are fundamental to understanding temple architecture in India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Vesara style is a well-recognized hybrid style that represents a significant synthesis of both Nagara and Dravida architectural features.  It showcases the interplay and fusion of elements from these two distinct traditions, resulting in a unique and recognizable style.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Hoysala temples of Karnataka, celebrated for their exquisite carvings, are best classified as exhibiting the Vesara style, which is a distinct blend of Nagara and Dravida elements. While some Nagara influences might be present, the statement's assertion of a primarily Nagara style with minimal Dravida influence is a misrepresentation of the Hoysala architectural tradition.


**6. With reference to the Pala style of sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pala style, flourishing in Bengal and Bihar between the 9th and 11th centuries, is characterized by sculptures with slender bodies, transparent drapery, and a focus on serene expressions.
2.  The Pala sculptures primarily depict Buddhist deities, with minimal representation of Hindu or Jain figures.
3. The Nalanda school of sculpture, which emerged during the Pala period, significantly deviated from the earlier Sarnath and Mathura Gupta traditions, developing its unique stylistic features.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Pala style of sculpture, prominent in Bengal and Bihar during the 9th-11th centuries, is characterized by sculptures featuring slender and graceful figures, transparent drapery clinging to the body, and a generally serene and peaceful expression on the faces of the deities. This aesthetic is a distinctive feature of Pala art.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Buddhist deities were a prominent subject in Pala art,  the Pala style also included depictions of Hindu and Jain figures. The statement presents an oversimplification of the subject matter represented in Pala sculpture.  A more nuanced understanding acknowledges the broader religious context of this artistic tradition.

Statement 3 is also correct. The Nalanda school of sculpture, which developed under Pala patronage, did show a degree of independence from the earlier Gupta traditions of Sarnath and Mathura. While it initially drew inspiration from these earlier styles, it eventually evolved its own distinct stylistic features, characterized by specific facial features, body proportions, and treatment of clothing and jewelry.  This demonstrates a process of artistic evolution and regional adaptation.


**7. With reference to the Mathura school of sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mathura school, prominent during the Kushana period, produced sculptures with fleshy bodies, broad shoulders, and garments covering only one shoulder.
2.  The Buddha images from Mathura are characterized by a round face, fleshy cheeks, and a pronounced belly, reflecting a more earthly and human representation.
3.  The Mathura school's style significantly influenced the later Sarnath school, with the Sarnath sculptures directly adopting the fleshy and voluminous forms seen in Mathura works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Mathura school of sculpture, flourishing during the Kushana period, is recognized for its sculptures featuring fleshy bodies, broad shoulders, and a distinct style of drapery that typically covers only one shoulder, leaving the other shoulder bare. This is a key feature differentiating Mathura sculptures from those of other schools.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Buddha images produced by the Mathura school frequently depict a round face, fleshy cheeks, and a noticeable belly. This style of representation reflects a more human and relatable portrayal of the Buddha, departing from earlier, more stylized depictions. This humanizing approach is a significant aspect of the Mathura aesthetic.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Mathura school did influence later schools, the Sarnath school, while initially showing some similarities, later evolved a distinct style characterized by slenderness and a more refined treatment of drapery, moving away from the fleshy and voluminous forms of Mathura. The statement oversimplifies the complex relationship and evolution between these two important schools.


**8. With reference to the Ajanta cave paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ajanta cave paintings, dating back to the 5th and 6th centuries CE, are renowned for their vibrant colours, fluid lines, and three-dimensional rendering of figures, showcasing mastery in perspective and depth.
2. The paintings depict a variety of subjects, including scenes from the Jataka tales, illustrating the life of the Buddha and his previous incarnations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, although the description of "mastery in perspective and depth" requires qualification. While the Ajanta paintings are celebrated for their vibrant colors, fluid lines, and a remarkable sense of movement and expressiveness in the figures,  the use of perspective and depth is not consistently applied in the Western sense.  The figures are often rendered in a way that creates a sense of depth and volume but not necessarily employing linear perspective as in Western art.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ajanta cave paintings extensively depict scenes from the Jataka tales, which narrate the Buddha's previous lives and illustrate the principles of Buddhism.  These narratives are a significant part of the subject matter of the Ajanta paintings.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ajanta paintings, although stylistically cohesive overall, do show some variations over time and reflect influences from different artistic traditions and regional styles.  The statement incorrectly suggests a complete uniformity of style, neglecting the nuances and evolution of the artistic conventions across the period of the paintings' creation.


**9. With reference to the Gandhara school of sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gandhara school, flourishing in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent during the Kushana period, is known for its hybrid style, combining Greco-Roman elements with Indian artistic traditions.

3. The Gandhara school's style heavily influenced the later Mathura school, with the Mathura sculptures adopting the Greco-Roman features prominently seen in Gandhara works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gandhara school of sculpture, prominent in the northwestern Indian subcontinent during the Kushana period, is indeed characterized by a unique blend of Greco-Roman and Indian artistic influences. This fusion of styles is a defining feature of Gandhara art.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Gandhara school predominantly focused on Buddhist subjects, portraying the Buddha, Bodhisattvas, and scenes from the Jataka tales. These depictions reflect the syncretic nature of the art, combining artistic elements from different cultures to express Buddhist narratives.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While both Gandhara and Mathura schools coexisted and influenced each other to some extent, the Mathura school developed its own distinct characteristics, and did not directly adopt the Greco-Roman features of Gandhara art to the same extent.  The statement oversimplifies the complex interaction and independent development of these two schools.  The Mathura style retained a more indigenous feel.

The text indicates that while the depiction of living forms was restricted in some contexts, other decorative motifs like floral designs were also used, showing a degree of assimilation of indigenous styles.


**1. With reference to temple architecture in Aihole, consider the following statements:**

1. The Durga temple at Aihole exhibits an apsidal shrine style reminiscent of Buddhist chaitya halls, predating other architectural styles found at the site.
2. The Lad Khan temple in Aihole is uniquely constructed from stone, drawing inspiration from the wooden-roofed temples of the hills.
3. The Virupaksh temple at Aihole features a veranda and shikhara stylistically aligned with Dravidian architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Durga temple at Aihole is indeed notable for its early apsidal shrine, a style echoing Buddhist chaitya halls, showcasing an innovative approach within the context of early temple architecture.  This predates the later styles seen in other temples at the site. The Lad Khan temple’s unique stone construction, inspired by hill region wooden temples, further highlights the architectural experimentation in Aihole.  However, the Virupaksh temple's architectural features are more aligned with Nagara style than Dravidian. The shikhara, while distinct, displays characteristics more closely related to Nagara than the stepped pyramids typical of Dravidian architecture.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the architectural features of the Aihole temples.

3.  The stellate plan, a star-like ground plan, is a distinguishing feature of Hoysala temples, resulting from numerous projecting angles extending from the basic square temple structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While soapstone was frequently used in Hoysala temples due to its ease of carving,  it wasn't the *exclusive* material.  Other stones were also employed. Therefore, statement 1 is partially true but not entirely accurate, making it a good distractor. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Hoysaleshvara temple at Halebid is, in fact, a *double* structure with separate buildings and mandapas.  The description of the temple as having a single structure designed for musical performances and dance is a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the temple's actual layout.  Statement 3 accurately captures the unique stellate plan of Hoysala temples which is formed by projecting angles from the initial square design.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of  the nuanced aspects of Hoysala temple architecture, differentiating accurate information from partially correct or incorrect statements.

Statement 1 accurately describes the *rekha-prasada* style, a common feature of Nagara-style temples in North India.  The gradual inward curve of the walls from a square base to a pointed apex is a defining characteristic.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the defining feature of Dravida temples—their enclosure within a compound wall and the presence of a *gopuram* as the main entrance.  This contrasts sharply with the typically open approach of Nagara temples.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The *jagamohana* (assembly hall) in Odisha temples is located *in front* of the *garbhagriha* (sanctum sanctorum), not behind it. It serves as the main entrance hall for worshippers, not as a secondary shrine.  While some Odisha temples might have secondary shrines, their placement is not directly linked to the *jagamohana*'s position.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the cire-perdu or "lost-wax" process was known as far back as the Indus Valley Civilization and is still utilized by present-day tribal artists.  This demonstrates the enduring nature of certain artistic techniques across vast spans of time and across different artistic communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Chola bronzes are renowned for their beauty and were indeed used for ritual worship, the text focuses on their depictions of Hindu icons, particularly those relating to the Shiva family and Vishnu's various avatars.  The statement incorrectly attributes the primary focus to Buddhist iconography. This highlights the importance of precise factual recall in understanding specific artistic styles and their religious associations.

Statement 3 is correct. The text directly mentions the Vakataka bronzes' contemporaneity with Gupta bronzes and their stylistic connection to the Amaravati school of Andhra Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "Dancing Girl" bronze from Mohenjodaro is indeed considered one of the earliest examples of bronze sculpture in India, dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization (approximately 2500 BCE).  Its tribhanga posture (three bends in the body) is a stylistic feature that would later be adopted and refined in later periods.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the lost-wax casting technique was known and used in ancient India, even as far back as the Indus Valley Civilization, its widespread use in bronze sculpture wasn't solely confined to the Gupta period.  The technique's evolution and refinement spanned many centuries and regions, with significant developments occurring across various periods and dynasties. The statement inaccurately limits its development to the Gupta period and its spread solely through monastic centers.  Many other workshops and artistic centers contributed to its development and dissemination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nagara and Dravida styles represent two distinct and major architectural traditions in India.  The Nagara style, prevalent in North India, is characterized by its curvilinear shikhara, a towering, curved spire. In contrast, the Dravida style, prominent in South India, features a pyramidal vimana, a stepped, pyramid-like structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the panchayatana style, with its central and four subsidiary shrines, is a significant architectural feature, it is not exclusive to the Dravida style.  Examples of panchayatana temples can be found in both North and South India, demonstrating the cross-regional exchange of architectural ideas.  Its association with a particular style is an oversimplification.

Statement 3 is correct. The Hoysala temples of Karnataka are indeed renowned for their distinctive "stellate" (star-shaped) ground plan, a result of complex angular projections from a central square. Their architecture represents a unique synthesis or hybrid style blending aspects of both Nagara and Dravida traditions, resulting in a highly original form.  The intricate and lavish carvings on these temples are also a defining feature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Qutub Minar is primarily constructed from red sandstone, with marble used more prominently in the upper levels. This combination of materials is a key characteristic of its construction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While pietra dura was indeed used extensively in Mughal architecture, particularly for decorative purposes, its widespread adoption didn't begin solely in the 17th century.  The technique’s use can be traced back to earlier periods, and its peak usage spanned across a longer timeframe than stated.

Statement 3 is correct. The architecture of Mandu stands as a prime example of the Provincial style within Indo-Islamic architecture. It effectively demonstrates the integration of local building traditions, visible in features like toranas (ornate gateways) and lintels, with the distinct elements of Islamic architectural design.  This blending of styles is a hallmark of the region's architectural heritage.


**4. With reference to prehistoric rock paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

2.  Rock paintings at Bhimbetka, Madhya Pradesh, showcase a wide range of themes, including hunting scenes, community dances, and depictions of daily life, spanning across different periods.
3.  The rock paintings of the Chalcolithic period at Bhimbetka depict naturalistic representations of animals, while humans are depicted in a highly stylized manner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the discovery of rock paintings in India predates that of Altamira, the earliest known Indian rock paintings were not initially found in the Vindhya range.  Archaeological discoveries have revealed various sites across India with prehistoric rock art, with some preceding the Vindhya discoveries.  The statement incorrectly pinpoints the Vindhya range as the location of the earliest discoveries.

Statement 2 is correct. Bhimbetka's rock shelters contain a remarkable collection of paintings depicting a diverse array of themes.  These include hunting scenes, community dances, and various aspects of daily life from prehistoric times.  The paintings span across different periods, providing valuable insights into the evolution of artistic expression and societal practices.

Statement 3 is partially correct but misleading. While the statement correctly identifies the stylized depiction of humans in contrast to the more naturalistic rendering of animals, it's important to note that the level of naturalism in animal depictions also varied across different periods and styles within the Chalcolithic phase.  The statement oversimplifies the artistic styles present.  The level of stylization in human figures is more consistent across the periods than in the animal representations.


**5. With reference to  Vijayanagara and Nayaka Paintings, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vijayanagara paintings, primarily found in temples like Virupaksha at Hampi, depict events from dynastic history and episodes from epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

3.  Kerala mural paintings, contemporary to the Nayaka period, evolved a distinct pictorial language, incorporating elements from traditions like Kathakali, and employing three-dimensional representations of figures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara school of painting is well documented in surviving temple murals.  Temples at Hampi and other sites prominently feature narratives from royal history, the Ramayana, and the Mahabharata.  The style is characterized by profile views of faces and a two-dimensional presentation of figures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Nayaka paintings built upon the Vijayanagara style, they did not significantly shift towards three-dimensional representations of figures.

**1. With reference to the evolution of temple architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara style, prevalent in North India, is characterized by a curvilinear shikhara, while the Dravida style, dominant in South India, features a pyramidal vimana.
2. The Vesara style represents a distinct architectural order, entirely independent of both Nagara and Dravida influences.
3.  Early Hindu temples primarily consisted of a garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), a mandapa (hall), and a  shikhara or vimana (spire), with the addition of elaborate boundary walls and gopurams (gateways) becoming common only in later periods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the fundamental differences between Nagara and Dravida temple styles.  Nagara temples are known for their curvilinear shikharas, while Dravida temples feature pyramidal vimanas.  Statement 3 is also largely correct. The core elements of early Hindu temples were the garbhagriha, mandapa, and spire. While some early temples might have had rudimentary boundary elements, the elaborate  gopurams and extensive walled enclosures became more characteristic of later periods, especially in the Dravidian style. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vesara style is indeed considered a hybrid style, drawing upon aspects of both Nagara and Dravida traditions, rather than being entirely independent.  It's a synthesis, not a completely separate architectural lineage.

2.  The pillars in Buddhist caves at both Ajanta and Ellora are uniformly massive, reflecting a consistent architectural style across these sites.
3.  While initially plastered and painted, the original artwork on the walls of the Buddhist caves at Ajanta and Ellora is largely lost due to the passage of time and environmental factors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Ajanta does have double-storied caves, while Ellora is notable for its triple-storied caves.  The statement incorrectly states Ajanta caves are exclusively single-storied. Statement 2 is incorrect because while the pillars are indeed massive in both locations, the question implies a uniform style, which isn't entirely accurate. There are variations in pillar design, even within the same site.  Statement 3 is accurate. The text explicitly mentions that the caves were plastered and painted, but little of the original artwork remains.  This highlights the challenges of preserving ancient artwork and the limitations of surviving evidence.  The options are designed to mislead, as the incorrect statements are plausible based on partial knowledge of the subject.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Cave 12 is a triple-storied structure, it contains images of Tara, Avalokiteshvara, Manushi Buddhas, and several other Buddhist deities, alongside Hindu figures.  This demonstrates the religious syncretism present at Ellora.  Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that Cave 14 is the only double-storied Brahmanical cave. Statement 3 is also correct; Kailash Leni (Cave 16) is described as a unique rock-cut temple carved from a single rock.  The options are crafted to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the specific cave numbers and their religious affiliations, making it a challenging question.

3.  The sculptures of fierce dvarapalas, or doorkeepers, are commonly found guarding the entrance to the garbhagriha of Dravida temples, contrasting with the river goddesses often seen at the entrance of Nagara temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dravida temples are characterized by their compound walls and gopurams, which are not typical features of Nagara temples. Statement 2 is incorrect. The vimana in Dravida style is a stepped pyramid, distinctly different from the curving shikhara of Nagara temples.  Statement 3 is correct; dvarapalas are commonly found guarding the entrance of Dravida temples, as opposed to the river goddesses frequently found at the entrance of Nagara temples. The options are carefully designed to test the candidate's understanding of the key differences between Dravida and Nagara architectural styles.  The inclusion of a partially correct statement makes it a difficult question.

**1. With reference to medieval Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *rekha-prasada* style, characterized by a tall, curvilinear *shikhara*, is a subtype of the Nagara order, predominantly found in North India.
2.  The *phamsana* style, with its broader, shorter structure and multiple, gently sloping roof slabs, is often found in the *mandapas* (assembly halls) of North Indian temples.
3.  *Valabhi* style temples, known for their rectangular structure with a rounded, wagon-vaulted roof, are exclusively found in Gujarat and exhibit no influence from Buddhist chaitya halls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The *rekha-prasada* style, a prominent feature of Nagara architecture, is characterized by its tall, curvilinear *shikhara* (tower).  This style is indeed predominantly found in North India.  Examples include the Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho and many temples in other parts of North India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The *phamsana* style, with its distinct characteristics of a broader, shorter structure and gently sloping roof slabs, is often used for *mandapas* (assembly halls) in North Indian temple complexes. The design contrasts with the taller, more sharply rising *latina* style typically used for the main *garbhagriha* (sanctum sanctorum).

Statement 3 is incorrect. While *Valabhi* style temples do feature rectangular structures with rounded, wagon-vaulted roofs,  it is inaccurate to say they are exclusively found in Gujarat or that they exhibit *no* influence from Buddhist chaitya halls.  The curved roof form of the *Valabhi* style shares similarities with the apsidal shape of Buddhist chaitya halls, suggesting a possible influence or shared architectural lineage.  The statement oversimplifies the complex interplay of architectural styles and regional variations.


**2. With reference to South Indian temple architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *gopuram*, a towering gateway, is a defining feature of Dravida temples, found exclusively in South India.
2.  The *vimana*, the main temple tower, in Dravida style temples has a stepped pyramid shape, unlike the curving *shikhara* of Nagara temples.
3.  Dravida temples are always surrounded by a compound wall, and the entrance is always guarded by fierce *dvarapalas* (doorkeepers).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The *gopuram* is indeed a characteristic feature of Dravida temples, although it's not entirely exclusive to South India as its presence can be seen in some other regions. However, it's more prominent and integral to the Dravidian architectural style.

Statement 2 is correct. The *vimana* in Dravida temples is characterized by its stepped pyramid shape, which contrasts sharply with the curvilinear *shikhara* of Nagara temples. This difference in the shape of the main tower is a key distinguishing factor between the two architectural styles.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While many Dravida temples are enclosed within a compound wall and feature *dvarapalas*, it's not a universal rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe distinct sub-styles within the Nagara order of temple architecture in early India.  The rekha-prasada (latina) style, with its tall, curving shikhara, is indeed a hallmark of Nagara temples, and the Dashavatara temple at Deogarh serves as a prime example of this style's evolution. The statement correctly identifies the key visual characteristic of the shikhara. The Phamsana style, with its broader, shorter form and multi-slabed, non-curving roof, is accurately contrasted with the latina style. Its frequent use for mandapas (assembly halls) in North Indian temple complexes is a well-documented architectural practice. Finally, the valabhi style, with its unique wagon-vaulted roof, is correctly linked to both early temple design and the architectural forms found in Buddhist chaitya caves, highlighting the continuity of design elements across religious traditions.  The description of the roof as "wagon-vaulted" accurately captures its distinctive shape. Therefore, all three statements are accurate representations of early Indian temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description accurately portrays the iconic Nataraja pose.  Shiva's posture, balancing on one leg while subduing Apasmara (the demon of ignorance), is a central element of the iconography. The specific details of the right leg and the suppression of Apasmara are key features of this representation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kalyanasundara Murti, representing the marriage of Shiva and Parvati, is indeed a significant South Indian bronze sculpture. However, the description is inaccurate in stating it's a single image. The Kalyanasundara Murti is typically depicted through two separate statuettes of Shiva and Parvati, showcasing the marriage ceremony (Panigrahana). The statement misrepresents the form of this particular sculpture.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ardhanarisvara Murti, depicting the androgynous form of Shiva and Parvati united as one, is correctly described as a single image.  The statement mistakenly attributes this representation to the Kalyanasundara Murti, which depicts the marriage as a separate ceremony. The statement confuses the iconography of two distinct bronze sculptures.

This fusion created a unique architectural expression found in certain regions of South India. The statement accurately reflects the hybrid nature of this architectural style.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Panchayatan style does feature a central shrine with four surrounding smaller shrines, it doesn't necessarily specify that all the shikharas must be of the latina type. The type of shikhara can vary within the Panchayatan style depending on regional variations and the period of construction. The statement imposes an unnecessary restriction on the types of shikharas found in the Panchayatan style.


**5. With reference to the Vijayanagara paintings, consider the following statements:**

1. The paintings at Tiruparakunram near Trichy represent an early phase of the Vijayanagara style, dating back to the 14th century.

The statement correctly identifies the evolution of the style.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The statement mistakenly attributes the profusely decorated halos and folded drapery to the Sarnath school.  In fact, it was the Mathura school that continued to depict these features while the Sarnath school is characterized by plain, transparent drapery and less ornamentation on the halos. The statement reverses the characteristics of these two schools.




**1. With reference to Mauryan art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lion Capital at Sarnath, a Mauryan pillar capital, originally included a wheel (Dharamchakra) atop the four lions.
2.  Mauryan pillars, unlike Achaemenian pillars, were rock-cut, showcasing advanced carving techniques.
3.  The Didarganj Yakshi, a polished sandstone sculpture, depicts a life-sized standing figure holding a flywhisk (chauri).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of Mauryan art and architecture.  The Lion Capital at Sarnath, a UNESCO World Heritage site and India's national emblem, originally featured a wheel representing the first sermon of Buddha (Dhammachakrapravartana).  This is well-documented in archaeological findings and historical accounts. The statement correctly highlights the contrast between Mauryan rock-cut pillars and the constructed Achaemenian pillars, demonstrating a significant advancement in Mauryan sculptural techniques. The description of the Didarganj Yakshi, a remarkably preserved sculpture, matches its actual features and is a testament to the skill of Mauryan artisans in depicting human form with sensitivity and detail.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one of these accurate statements.


**2. With reference to the religious landscape of ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1. Buddhism, while becoming a prominent social and religious movement, absorbed elements of pre-existing Yaksha worship.
2.  The construction of stupas and viharas was exclusively confined to Buddhist traditions, reflecting their unique monastic practices.
3. The Barabar caves, patronized by Ashoka for the Ajivika sect, exemplify rock-cut cave architecture of the Mauryan period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct because the text explicitly states that Yaksha worship, prevalent before and after Buddhism, was assimilated into both Buddhism and Jainism.  This demonstrates religious syncretism and the flexible nature of religious practices in ancient India.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While stupas and viharas were central to Buddhist monastic life, the text mentions that other architectural forms like stone pillars, rock-cut caves, and monumental sculptures were also prevalent during this period, and weren't exclusively Buddhist. Statement 3 is correct. The Lomus Rishi cave at Barabar Hills, carved for the Ajivika sect and patronized by Ashoka, is a key example of rock-cut cave architecture from the Mauryan period.  Therefore, option (b) accurately reflects the correct statements.


**3. With reference to bronze sculpture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Dancing Girl" from Mohenjodaro, a copper figure, represents the earliest known example of bronze sculpture in India, dating back to the Indus Valley Civilization.
2. Chola bronze sculptures, renowned for their refined aesthetic, are characterized by the use of the lost-wax casting technique and often depict deities in dynamic poses.
3.  The bronze casting technique was primarily utilized for religious iconography, with little use for everyday objects during the medieval period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the "Dancing Girl" is an early example of bronze casting, the text specifies that it is made of copper, not bronze. Bronze involves an alloy of copper, tin, and zinc. Statement 2 is entirely correct. Chola bronzes are indeed famous for their refined aesthetic, use of the lost-wax technique, and depiction of deities in dynamic poses like the Nataraja. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly mentions that bronze casting was used for both religious icons and everyday objects like utensils, highlighting its versatility.  Therefore, only statement 2 is fully accurate about the given subject.


**4. With reference to the Indo-Islamic architecture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Indo-Islamic architecture is characterized by a fusion of local Indian techniques (trabeation, brackets, multiple pillars) with introduced archuate forms supported by voussoirs and keystones.
2. The Qutub Minar in Delhi exemplifies the early adoption of archuate construction in Indo-Islamic architecture, showcasing the integration of Islamic and local styles.
3.  The absence of figurative representation in Islamic art led to a complete rejection of pre-existing Indian sculptural traditions in Indo-Islamic architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the hybrid nature of Indo-Islamic architecture. It correctly identifies the blending of indigenous Indian structural elements with the introduction of Islamic arch and dome construction techniques. Statement 2 is also correct; the Qutub Minar exemplifies this architectural synthesis, although it's important to note that some elements predate the fully developed Indo-Islamic style. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Islamic art largely avoided figurative representation, the text mentions that Muslim builders absorbed many features of local cultures, resulting in a blend of styles rather than a complete rejection of existing traditions.  Hence, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.



**5. With reference to Jain temple architecture and sculpture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola, a monolithic free-standing structure, is the world's tallest statue of Lord Bahubali.
2.  Jain temples at Mount Abu, built by Vimal Shah, are characterized by a simplistic exterior and exuberant marble interiors with rich sculptural decoration.
3.  The Akota hoard of Jain bronzes, found near Baroda, primarily consists of images of Hindu deities, reflecting the syncretic nature of religious practices in Gujarat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate; the Gomateshwara statue at Sravana Belagola is indeed the world's tallest monolithic free-standing sculpture. Statement 2 is also correct. The description of the Jain temples at Mount Abu, built by Vimal Shah, matches their architectural features and sculptural richness. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Akota hoard is explicitly mentioned as a hoard of *Jain* bronzes, not Hindu deities. This statement introduces a misleading element by incorrectly attributing the bronzes to a different religion. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are factually correct.


**6. With reference to the sculptural traditions of ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mathura sculptures of the Kushana period are characterized by a fleshy, rotund body style, in contrast to the more slender figures of the Gupta period.
2.  The Gandhara style, evident in the Buddha head from Taxila, exhibits a blend of Greco-Roman and local Indian artistic conventions.
3.  The Sarnath school of sculpture, exemplified by the seated Buddha from Sarnath, is known for its highly ornate and heavily decorated haloes around the Buddha's head.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately contrasts the Kushana and Gupta periods' sculptural styles. Kushana sculptures are described as having fleshy bodies, while Gupta sculptures show a shift towards a more slender aesthetic. Statement 2 is also correct. The Gandhara style's fusion of Greco-Roman and Indian elements is a well-established fact in art history. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Sarnath school is noted for its refined style, the text specifically mentions that the halo in the example from Sarnath is *plain* and has very little ornamentation, contradicting the statement.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**7. With reference to temple architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The basic structure of a Hindu temple typically includes a garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), a mandapa (hall), and a shikhara (spire) or vimana (tower).
2.  The nagara style of temple architecture, prevalent in North India, is characterized by a curving shikhara, while the dravida style in South India features a pyramidal vimana.
3.  The Vesara style is a distinct architectural style completely independent of any influence from both Nagara and Dravida styles.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the fundamental components of a Hindu temple. Statement 2 correctly distinguishes the nagara and dravida styles based on their spire/tower shapes.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While Vesara is considered a distinct style, the text suggests it arises from a *selective mixing* of Nagara and Dravida elements, not complete independence.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately represent the facts.


**8. With reference to the paintings of the Vijayanagara and Nayaka periods, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vijayanagara paintings, found in places like Hampi and Lepakshi, frequently depict scenes from Hindu epics (Ramayana, Mahabharata) and royal history.
2.  Nayaka paintings, while generally following the stylistic conventions of the Vijayanagara period, show a shift towards less heavy abdomens in male figures.
3.  Kerala mural paintings developed entirely independently of stylistic influences from the Vijayanagara and Nayaka schools.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the themes commonly depicted in Vijayanagara paintings. Statement 2 correctly notes a stylistic difference between Vijayanagara and Nayaka paintings, specifically regarding the depiction of male figures. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Kerala mural painting *did* incorporate elements from the Nayaka and Vijayanagara schools, albeit with regional modifications. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**9. With reference to the Amaravati Stupa, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amaravati Stupa, similar to the Sanchi Stupa, features a pradakshinapatha (circumambulatory path) enclosed within a vedika (railing) decorated with narrative sculptures.
2.  The Amaravati Stupa's sculptural decoration includes depictions of events from the life of the Buddha and Jataka stories, but notably lacks depictions of the Buddha himself.
3.  The sculptural style of Amaravati is characterized by slender figures, dynamic movement (tribhanga), and a complex interplay of volumes creating three-dimensional space in relief.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both Amaravati and Sanchi stupas share the feature of an enclosed circumambulatory path with a railing featuring narrative sculptures. Statement 2 is incorrect. The text notes that while early phases lack Buddha images, later phases (second and third centuries CE) do include Buddha images. Statement 3 is correct. The description accurately captures the artistic characteristics of Amaravati sculptures.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**10. With reference to the Pala and Sena styles of sculpture in Eastern India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pala style of sculpture, flourishing between the 9th and 11th centuries in Bengal and Bihar, shows a synthesis of Gupta, local Vanga, and Central Indian artistic influences.
2.  The Sena style, succeeding the Pala style, is characterized by the use of terracotta as the primary medium for sculpting Buddhist and Hindu deities.
3.  Temples from the Pala period in Bengal exhibit the "Bangla roof," a distinctive sloping roof form later adopted in Mughal architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Pala style's synthesis of various artistic influences. Statement 2 is incorrect. While terracotta was used, it's not stated to be the *primary* medium for the Sena style. The text mentions that terracotta was prominent in Bengal *until* the 7th century. Statement 3 is also incorrect.  The "Bangla roof" is explicitly linked to later periods (Mughal and beyond), not the Pala period.  Only statement 1 accurately reflects the information provided.



**1. With reference to Chola bronze sculptures, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola queen Sembiyan Maha Devi was a distinguished patron of bronze casting during the 10th century.
2.  Chola bronzes predominantly depict deities in the ardhaparyanka asana (one leg dangling) posture.
3. The Nataraja bronze sculpture, a well-known Chola-period artwork, showcases Shiva balancing on his right leg and suppressing the apasmara demon.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Historical records confirm Sembiyan Maha Devi's significant patronage of bronze casting during the Chola period's flourishing artistic phase in the 10th century.  Her support contributed significantly to the high quality and artistic merit of the bronzes produced during her reign.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ardhaparyanka asana is seen in some Pallava-period bronzes, it's not the *predominant* posture in Chola bronzes. Chola bronzes exhibit a wider range of postures, including the iconic tribhanga (three bends) and the dynamic poses seen in Nataraja sculptures.  The statement oversimplifies the diverse stylistic choices of Chola bronze sculptors.

Statement 3 is correct. The Nataraja bronze sculptures of the Chola period are famous for their depiction of Shiva in a dynamic dance posture, balancing on one leg and suppressing the apasmara demon, representing the triumph of good over evil and the cyclical nature of time. This specific iconography is a hallmark of Chola artistry.

3. The Virupaksha temple in Hampi features Vijayanagara paintings on its ceiling, narrating events from the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tiruparakunram paintings represent an *early* phase of the Vijayanagara style, not the mature phase. The mature phase is characterized by more refined techniques and stylistic elements.  The description of three-dimensionality is more accurate for later Nayaka paintings, which built upon Vijayanagara styles but developed their own characteristics.

Statement 2 is correct.  The stylistic conventions of Vijayanagara painting included depicting figures with narrow waists and profile faces featuring large, frontal eyes. This distinctive artistic language is a key element in identifying Vijayanagara artwork.

Statement 3 is correct. The ceiling of the Virupaksha temple in Hampi showcases Vijayanagara paintings that depict scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, alongside dynastic history.  This demonstrates the incorporation of religious and historical narratives within the artistic tradition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Gomateshwara statue of Lord Bahubali is indeed the world's tallest monolithic free-standing sculpture, it is located in Sravana Belagola, Karnataka, not Bihar.  The statement incorrectly places the statue's location.

Statement 3 is correct. The Akota hoard, discovered near Baroda (Vadodara), Gujarat, is a significant collection of Jain bronzes from the 5th-7th centuries CE.  These bronzes are notable for their fine craftsmanship and the use of inlay work to enhance details.


**4. With reference to the Indo-Islamic architecture of Mandu, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jama Masjid at Mandu is a large-scale mosque, entered through a monumental gateway topped with a squat dome.
2. The Pathan architecture of Mandu heavily deviates from the Imperial Delhi style, showcasing strong regional traditions.
3. The Jahaz Mahal at Mandu exemplifies the robust, austere Pathan architectural style, characterized by a lack of surface embellishments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jama Masjid in Mandu is indeed a large mosque with a monumental gateway and a squat dome, reflecting its purpose to accommodate numerous worshippers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Pathan architecture of Mandu, while having some regional characteristics, is considered relatively close to the Imperial Delhi style rather than significantly deviating from it. The statement misrepresents the stylistic relationship.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Jahaz Mahal, while exhibiting Pathan architectural features, is not characterized by an *austere* lack of surface embellishments. It incorporates decorative elements like jalis (lattice screens) and carved brackets. The statement wrongly describes the decorative aspects.


**5. With reference to the features of the Taj Mahal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Taj Mahal's main body is topped with a single dome and four smaller cupolas, creating a symmetrical skyline.
2. The marble used in the Taj Mahal was quarried from the Makrana mines in Rajasthan, contrasting with the red sandstone of the surrounding structures.
3.  The interior of the Taj Mahal's mausoleum features only stone carvings in high and low relief, with no use of pietra dura or calligraphy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Taj Mahal's central structure is crowned by a large dome and four smaller cupolas, creating a visually striking and balanced skyline. The symmetrical design is a key feature of the monument's architectural harmony.

Statement 2 is correct.  The white marble used extensively in the Taj Mahal's construction originated from the Makrana mines in Rajasthan. This choice of material, combined with the use of red sandstone in other parts of the complex, creates a visual contrast and enhances the aesthetic impact.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The interior of the Taj Mahal's mausoleum is richly decorated, employing not only stone carvings in high and low relief but also intricate pietra dura inlay work and calligraphy using jasper and other materials. The statement omits important decorative elements.
