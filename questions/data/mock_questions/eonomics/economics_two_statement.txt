1.  The policy aims to double agricultural exports from $30 billion in 2017-18 to $60 billion by 2022 and reach $100 billion in subsequent years.
2.  The policy prioritizes the diversification of export destinations but maintains a focus on staple crops like cereals, pulses, and oilseeds to maintain food security.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Agriculture Export Policy 2018 explicitly aimed to significantly increase agricultural exports, with a target of doubling exports from the level achieved in 2017-18 to over $60 billion by 2022, and further increasing them to $100 billion in the years following. This ambitious goal reflects the government's strategy to leverage India's agricultural potential in the global market and boost farmer income.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the policy does aim for diversification of export destinations, a key component focuses on boosting high-value and value-added agricultural exports, including perishables.  This shift away from a reliance on staple crops indicates a strategic move towards higher profit margins and greater market competitiveness. The policy recognizes the importance of food security but seeks to achieve it through enhanced productivity and value addition, rather than by solely focusing on staple crop exports.  The emphasis is on moving up the value chain and diversifying the export basket beyond traditional commodities.


**3. With reference to Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  IFS models are designed to be universally applicable across all agro-climatic zones to maximize resource utilization.
2.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare has emphasized IFS as a key strategy for achieving the goal of doubling farmers' income by 2022.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

1.  The lack of appropriate farm machinery and technology specifically designed for minimum soil disturbance hinders widespread adoption.
2.  Farmers' traditional knowledge and practices are often incompatible with CA principles, leading to resistance to change.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A major hurdle to the widespread adoption of Conservation Agriculture (CA) in India is the limited availability of suitable farm machinery and technology adapted for minimum soil disturbance.  Traditional farming practices often rely on extensive tillage, and transitioning to no-till or reduced-till methods requires specialized equipment that may be expensive or inaccessible to many farmers, especially smallholders. This technological gap presents a significant barrier to the broader implementation of CA.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While incorporating traditional knowledge into modern agricultural practices is important, it is inaccurate to suggest that traditional knowledge is inherently incompatible with CA principles.  In fact, several CA techniques align with traditional sustainable farming practices, such as maintaining soil cover and crop rotation. The challenge lies not in inherent incompatibility but in adapting and integrating traditional knowledge with the technical aspects of CA, requiring effective extension services and farmer training.  Farmers' concerns often stem from practical limitations like access to technology, credit, and market linkages rather than a fundamental rejection of CA principles.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the cropping patterns prevalent in India:**

1.  Monocropping involves cultivating a single crop on the same land year after year, often leading to soil degradation.
2.  Relay cropping, a type of multiple cropping, involves planting a succeeding crop before harvesting the preceding crop.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Monocropping, the practice of cultivating a single crop repeatedly on the same land, is indeed associated with several risks, including soil degradation.  The continuous cultivation of the same crop depletes specific soil nutrients, increases vulnerability to pests and diseases, and can lead to soil erosion and compaction.  Diversification through crop rotation or intercropping are essential to mitigate these risks and maintain soil health.

Statement 2 is also correct. Relay cropping is a specialized form of multiple cropping where the seeds or seedlings of the succeeding crop are planted before the harvesting of the preceding crop. This technique allows for efficient land use and maximizes the growing season, leading to increased productivity.  It requires precise timing and careful management to ensure that both crops receive adequate resources and do not compete excessively.  Examples include planting potatoes before harvesting maize or radish before harvesting potatoes.


**6. With reference to the components of India's food systems, consider the following statements:**

1. A sustainable food system prioritizes economic sustainability above social and environmental considerations to ensure profitability.
2.  The food system interacts with other key systems like the energy system and trade system, and changes in one system can impact others.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The concept of a sustainable food system (SFS) emphasizes a holistic approach that integrates economic, social, and environmental considerations. While economic viability is crucial, it should not come at the expense of social equity or environmental protection.  A truly sustainable food system ensures equitable distribution of benefits, protects natural resources, and promotes the well-being of all stakeholders, including farmers, consumers, and the environment.  Profitability should be viewed within the broader context of long-term sustainability and social responsibility.

Statement 2 is correct. India's food system is intricately linked to various other systems, including energy, trade, and health.  For instance, the use of biofuels impacts agricultural land allocation and food production.  Similarly, international trade policies and agreements affect food prices and availability.  Changes in one system can trigger cascading effects throughout the food system and beyond, highlighting the interconnectedness of various sectors in a complex economy.  Understanding these interlinkages is vital for creating effective policies and strategies for sustainable development.


**7.  With reference to the White Revolution in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The White Revolution, spearheaded by Dr. Verghese Kurien, focused primarily on increasing milk production and augmenting rural incomes through the establishment of a three-tier cooperative structure.
2.  The success of the White Revolution is solely attributed to the government's financial investments and subsidies provided to dairy farmers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

2.  Sustainable development prioritizes economic growth over environmental protection to ensure national economic progress.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The widely accepted definition of sustainable development, as articulated in the Brundtland Report (Our Common Future), emphasizes the need to balance present needs with the needs of future generations.  It's not merely about economic growth but about ensuring that development is environmentally sound, socially equitable, and economically viable, such that it can be sustained over the long term.  This intergenerational equity is fundamental to the concept of sustainable development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sustainable development explicitly rejects the notion that economic growth should supersede environmental protection.  It recognizes that environmental degradation undermines long-term economic viability and social well-being.  Therefore, sustainable development seeks an integrated approach that balances economic growth with environmental protection and social equity.  It calls for a paradigm shift from a purely growth-oriented approach to one that considers the ecological limits of the planet and the needs of all stakeholders.


**1. With reference to the Indian fertilizer subsidy regime, consider the following statements:**

1.  Urea prices are regulated and fixed by the government, while DAP, MoP, and complex fertilizers' prices are market-driven.
2.  The Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) model, in effect since 2010, provides subsidies based on the nutrient content of DAP and MoP fertilizers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indian fertilizer subsidy system. Statement 1 correctly identifies the price regulation for urea, contrasting it with the deregulated pricing of other major fertilizers like DAP (Diammonium Phosphate), MoP (Muriate of Potash), and complex fertilizers. This price difference stems from the government's intervention to ensure affordability of urea, a crucial nitrogen-based fertilizer for Indian farmers.  The market-driven pricing of other fertilizers allows for competition and price flexibility based on market forces and international prices.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) scheme, implemented in 2010, fundamentally altered the fertilizer subsidy system.  Instead of providing subsidies based on the quantity of fertilizer produced, the NBS focuses on the amount of essential nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) present in the fertilizers. This shift aimed to incentivize the production and use of fertilizers with higher nutrient content, promoting efficiency and better utilization of resources.  The fixed per-kg subsidy on nutrients under NBS, irrespective of market prices, aims to stabilize farmer costs while allowing for market-determined final prices.  Therefore, both statements accurately depict key features of the Indian fertilizer subsidy structure.


**2. With reference to the distribution of PDS kerosene in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Eleven states/UTs receive no PDS kerosene allocation from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MOP&NG).
2.  The retail selling price of PDS kerosene is maintained at a NIL under-recovery level on a pan-India basis, effective from 1st March 2020.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of the Public Distribution System (PDS) for kerosene in India. Statement 1 highlights the fact that a significant number of states and union territories (11) do not receive any allocation of kerosene under the PDS from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. This is due to factors such as high LPG penetration, low demand, or voluntary surrenders by states.  The absence of allocation reflects a policy shift toward reducing kerosene subsidies and promoting cleaner cooking fuels like LPG.

Statement 2 correctly states that from March 1st, 2020, the retail selling price of PDS kerosene was maintained at a NIL under-recovery level across India.  This means the selling price is aligned with the market price, eliminating central government subsidies.  While some states might provide additional subsidies at the state level (as mentioned in the text regarding Tamil Nadu), the central government's direct subsidy on PDS kerosene has been removed.  Therefore, both statements reflect the current state of kerosene distribution under the PDS in India, showing the government's strategy of reducing subsidies and promoting market mechanisms.



**3. With reference to the "new urea policy 2015" in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy aimed to maximize indigenous urea production by pooling domestic gas with imported Re-gasified Liquified Natural Gas (R-LNG).
2.  All gas-based urea plants were categorized into three groups based on energy norms, receiving the same subsidy per kg regardless of actual production costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately represent key features of India's "new urea policy 2015." Statement 1 correctly notes the policy's objective to boost domestic urea production.  A crucial element of this strategy was the pooling of natural gas resources. By combining domestically produced natural gas with imported Re-gasified Liquified Natural Gas (R-LNG), the policy aimed to provide a uniform and stable gas supply to all urea manufacturing plants connected to the national gas grid. This ensured consistent production, reducing India's reliance on urea imports.

Statement 2 is also accurate. The policy categorized all gas-based urea plants into three groups according to their energy efficiency (gas consumption per unit of urea produced).  Crucially, plants within the same category received an identical subsidy per kilogram of urea, irrespective of their individual production costs. This mechanism aimed to incentivize energy efficiency.  Plants with lower production costs would be more profitable under this system, encouraging them to adopt better technologies and practices.  Therefore, the policy successfully addressed both production enhancement and efficiency improvement through its gas pooling and group-based subsidy structure.

2.  The policy emphasized a stable trade policy regime with minimal state intervention to ensure predictable export conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the objectives and strategies of India's Agriculture Export Policy 2018. Statement 1 correctly states the ambitious export target. The policy aimed to significantly increase agricultural exports, aiming to double them from the level of approximately $30 billion in 2017-18 to $60 billion by 2022. This ambitious goal reflected the government's commitment to boosting agricultural income and integrating Indian farmers into global value chains.  The policy also had a longer-term goal to reach $100 billion in agricultural exports.

Statement 2 also correctly points to the policy's emphasis on stability and predictability.  Recognizing the negative impacts of frequent changes in export regulations (such as bans, minimum export prices, etc.), the policy stressed the importance of a stable trade policy regime with limited government intervention.  This aimed to enhance India's credibility as a reliable supplier in the global market and attract foreign investment in the agricultural sector.  Therefore, both statements highlight critical aspects of the policy's vision and approach.


**6. With reference to the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for fertilizer subsidies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under the DBT system, farmers receive urea at subsidized prices, while P&K fertilizers are purchased at market prices with subsidies transferred directly to farmers' accounts.
2. The government has explored implementing a Direct Cash Transfer (DCT) model, where farmers purchase fertilizers at market prices and receive the subsidy amount directly into their accounts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system and related proposals for fertilizer subsidies in India. Statement 1 describes the existing DBT mechanism for fertilizer subsidies.  Under this system, urea continues to be sold to farmers at the government-fixed subsidized price. However, for P&K fertilizers (phosphorus and potassium), farmers purchase them at market prices. The subsidy amount is then directly credited to their accounts using Point of Sale (PoS) machines linked to the government's e-Urvarak DBT portal. This system uses biometric authentication to verify the identity of the beneficiary.

Statement 2 correctly notes the government's exploration of a Direct Cash Transfer (DCT) model as an alternative approach.  This model would involve farmers purchasing fertilizers at the prevailing market price and then receiving the subsidy amount directly into their bank accounts.  While the DCT model has been studied, it hasn't been fully implemented nationwide due to concerns about farmers having to pay upfront market prices and potential delays in subsidy disbursement.  The government is actively exploring mechanisms to address these issues, such as using e-wallets to pre-load subsidy amounts.  Therefore, both statements reflect current practices and policy considerations regarding fertilizer subsidies in India.


**7. Consider the following statements about the challenges in adopting Conservation Agriculture (CA) in India:**

1. The lack of suitable farm machinery for minimum soil disturbance seeding and crop harvesting hinders widespread adoption.
2. Inadequate knowledge and awareness among agricultural leaders, extension agents, and farmers about CA's potential limit its implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect significant challenges in implementing Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices in India. Statement 1 correctly points to the technological barrier.  While CA advocates for minimum soil disturbance, the widespread availability and affordability of appropriate farm machinery for seeding and harvesting remain limited.  Traditional tillage methods are deeply ingrained, and the transition to CA requires significant investment in new technologies that are often beyond the reach of small and marginal farmers.  This lack of accessible and appropriate machinery is a major obstacle to wider CA adoption.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the knowledge gap.  The successful implementation of CA hinges on the understanding and acceptance of its principles and practices by various stakeholders, including farmers, extension workers, and agricultural leaders.  Inadequate training, awareness campaigns, and effective extension services limit the knowledge dissemination about CA's potential benefits, its techniques, and its adaptation to diverse agro-climatic conditions. This lack of awareness creates resistance to change and hinders the adoption of CA practices.  Therefore, both technological limitations and knowledge deficits pose significant challenges to the wider implementation of CA in India.

1. PMKSKs aim to transform existing retail fertilizer shops into multi-service centers providing agri-inputs, testing facilities, and information on government schemes.
2. The scheme primarily focuses on sales of fertilizers and does not include other services for farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the core objective of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samruddhi Kendras (PMKSK) scheme.  The scheme aims to significantly upgrade and expand the role of existing retail fertilizer shops in India.  The goal is to transform these shops into multi-service centers that cater to a wider range of farmer needs.  PMKSKs are envisioned as one-stop shops providing not only agricultural inputs like fertilizers, seeds, and implements but also crucial services such as soil, seed, and fertilizer testing facilities. They also aim to disseminate information about various government schemes and provide regular capacity-building training for retailers.  This integrated approach aims to strengthen the link between farmers and government support systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  It directly contradicts the primary goal of the PMKSK scheme.  The scheme explicitly aims to go beyond mere fertilizer sales, offering a broader range of services and information to farmers. The intention is to create a more comprehensive support system for farmers, assisting them with various aspects of their agricultural activities.  The emphasis on providing multiple services reflects a holistic approach to farmer welfare and empowerment, moving beyond a purely transactional relationship.


**10. With reference to the  "Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Urvarak Pariyojana - One Nation One Fertiliser (ONOF)" scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. Under ONOF, fertilizer companies are required to use a standardized "Bharat" brand name and logo on their fertilizer bags.
2.  The scheme aims to reduce the variety of fertilizer brands available in the market to enhance competition among fertilizer companies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key provision of the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Urvarak Pariyojana - One Nation One Fertiliser (ONOF) scheme. The scheme mandates a significant change in the branding and labeling of fertilizers in India.  Fertilizer companies are required to display a standardized "Bharat" brand name and logo on a significant portion (two-thirds) of their fertilizer bags.  This measure aims to promote transparency and reduce confusion among farmers regarding the quality and authenticity of fertilizers.  The standardized branding helps to create a sense of uniformity and trust, regardless of the company producing the fertilizer.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The scheme does not primarily focus on reducing the number of fertilizer companies operating in the market to enhance competition. Instead, the primary focus is on standardizing the branding and labeling to create a uniform and easily recognizable brand for farmers across the country. While the scheme could potentially indirectly influence market dynamics, its main goal is not to reduce the number of players or promote heightened competition.  The standardization aims to improve transparency and build trust, rather than directly impacting market competition.


**1. With reference to the role of cooperatives in Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1. The success of milk cooperatives in Gujarat demonstrates the potential of cooperatives to transform the socio-economic landscape, benefiting both farmers and consumers.
2.  Cooperatives in India have faced setbacks due to factors such as inadequate coverage of farmer members and inefficient financial management.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the significant role played by milk cooperatives, particularly in Gujarat, in improving the livelihoods of farmers and providing affordable milk to consumers.  The Amul model is often cited as a successful example of cooperative enterprise, demonstrating the potential for cooperatives to achieve substantial economic and social impact.  This success showcases the benefits of collective action, efficient management, and market integration.

Statement 2 is also correct. Despite the success stories, cooperatives in India have encountered challenges. Inadequate membership coverage limits the reach and impact of cooperatives, leaving many farmers outside the benefits of collective marketing and bargaining power. Inefficient financial management, including issues with transparency and accountability, has also hampered the growth and sustainability of several cooperatives. These issues highlight the need for improved governance, financial literacy, and supportive policies to strengthen the cooperative sector.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe aspects of the Indian cooperative experience.


**2. With reference to government interventions in agricultural markets, consider the following statements:**

1.  The maintenance of buffer stocks of wheat and rice by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) is a policy instrument aimed at protecting farmer income and providing subsidized food grains to the poor.
2. Despite government intervention, private trade (moneylenders, rural elites, merchants, and wealthy farmers) predominantly handles agricultural markets in India, accounting for over 90% of transactions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FCI's role in maintaining buffer stocks is a key element of government intervention in agricultural markets.  By procuring grains at Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), the government aims to provide price support to farmers and prevent price volatility.  The buffer stocks also ensure food security by providing subsidized food grains through the Public Distribution System (PDS) to vulnerable populations.  This intervention seeks to address market failures and protect both producers and consumers.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the government plays a role through procurement and distribution, the private sector remains the dominant force in agricultural markets in India.  Private traders, moneylenders, and wealthy farmers control a significant share of the market, often influencing prices and impacting farmers' incomes. This dominance highlights the challenges of government regulation and the need for market reforms to ensure fair prices and equitable access to markets for all farmers.  The substantial private sector share (over 90% as stated in the passage) underscores the limitations of government intervention alone in regulating agricultural markets.


**3. With reference to alternative marketing channels in Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Apni Mandi (Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan), Hadaspar Mandi (Pune), Rythu Bazars (Andhra Pradesh), and Uzhavar Sandies (Tamil Nadu) are examples of regulated market yards designed to improve price transparency and farmer incomes.
2.  Direct sales of produce from farmers to consumers increase farmers' share in the price paid by consumers, reducing the role of intermediaries and enhancing farmer profitability.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Apni Mandi, Hadaspar Mandi, Rythu Bazars, and Uzhavar Sandies are examples of *alternative* marketing channels, not regulated market yards.  While some aspects of these markets may have regulatory oversight, they are primarily designed to facilitate direct farmer-consumer interaction, bypassing the traditional regulated market system and its intermediaries.  These channels aim to enhance farmer income by eliminating the profit margins of middlemen.  The statement mischaracterizes these initiatives as regulated market yards, which typically involve more formalized structures and regulations.

Statement 2 is correct. Direct marketing channels, such as farmer's markets and direct sales to consumers or processors, allow farmers to capture a larger share of the consumer price, thus increasing their income and reducing dependence on intermediaries. This strategy helps farmers to avoid exploitation by middlemen and gain greater control over pricing and marketing of their produce.  The elimination of intermediaries directly benefits farmers by increasing their profit margins.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text directly links high capital-output ratio as a reason for low output despite high savings in the Indian economy.  A high capital-output ratio indicates that a large amount of capital investment is required to generate a unit of output.  This implies inefficiencies in resource allocation and utilization, hindering overall economic growth.  The UPSC often tests the understanding of macroeconomic indicators and their implications for economic development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text does not explicitly state that illiteracy and weak administrative machinery are *not* major factors. In fact, it can be inferred that these factors, along with others, are likely to be significant hindrances to realizing India's potential GDP. Illiteracy impacts human capital formation and productivity, while a weak administrative machinery can create bottlenecks and inefficiencies in various sectors.  The statement attempts to create a false sense of security, acting as a distractor by omitting the impact of factors that are generally understood to hinder economic progress.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes a key objective of the Warehousing (Development & Regulation) Act 2007.  The Act aims to establish a regulated warehousing system, promoting the use of negotiable warehouse receipts (NWRs).  NWRs provide farmers with a readily tradable and bankable instrument representing their stored produce. This facilitates access to credit, enabling farmers to obtain loans against their produce without having to sell it immediately.  This improves their financial position and reduces their dependence on exploitative moneylenders.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act mandates registration of warehouses issuing NWRs, it is not with the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare.  The registration is done with the Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA), which is constituted under the Act and falls under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution.  The WDRA ensures that the registered warehouses meet the required standards and provides oversight of the system.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The MSP system aims to provide a safety net for farmers by ensuring a minimum price for their produce. This protects them against price fluctuations in the market. However, it's crucial to note that while the MSP is announced, it doesn't guarantee procurement of all produce at that price.  The actual procurement depends on factors like market prices and availability of storage facilities. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While government agencies and consumer cooperatives do participate in agricultural marketing, their share in the overall market is significantly smaller than that of the private sector. Private trade, involving moneylenders, rural elites, big merchants, and wealthy farmers, dominates agricultural markets in India, handling over 90% of transactions. The government's role is primarily in price support, buffer stock management, and distribution through the Public Distribution System (PDS).  Therefore, only statement 1 reflects a partially accurate picture of government intervention. Options (b), (c), and (d) are inaccurate because they do not correctly reflect the dominant role of the private sector in agricultural marketing and the limitations of the MSP mechanism.

2. Migration, though involving costs, contributes to human capital formation due to increased earnings in new locations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While investment in education is a significant source of human capital formation, it is not the sole primary source.  Other crucial factors contributing to human capital formation include investments in health, on-the-job training, and information acquisition.  A holistic approach to human capital development recognizes the interplay of various factors impacting an individual's productivity and overall contribution to the economy.  Neglecting health, for instance, can drastically reduce an individual's work capacity, thereby undermining the effectiveness of educational investment. Similarly, on-the-job training enhances skills and productivity, adding to the human capital stock.

Statement 2 is correct. Migration, although involving costs like transportation, relocation, and adjusting to a new environment, often leads to higher earnings in the destination location. This increased earning capacity directly contributes to human capital formation. The increased income reflects an improvement in human capital, as the individual's skills and productivity are valued more highly in the new location.  The net benefit from higher earnings outweighs the migration costs, making migration a contributing factor to human capital growth.  This is particularly relevant in the context of India, where internal migration from rural to urban areas and international migration are common phenomena influencing the country's human capital dynamics.


**2. With reference to the sources of human capital, consider the following statements:**

1.  Preventive medicine, such as vaccination, is a less significant source of human capital formation compared to curative medicine.
2. Firms' expenditure on on-the-job training is a source of human capital formation as it enhances labor productivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Preventive medicine plays a crucial role in human capital formation. By preventing illnesses, it ensures a healthier and more productive workforce.  While curative medicine addresses existing health issues, preventive measures like vaccination significantly reduce healthcare costs and lost productivity due to illness.  A healthy population is a productive population, and preventive medicine is a vital component in building a strong human capital base.  This is especially critical in developing countries like India with significant health challenges.  The long-term economic benefits of preventive healthcare far outweigh the immediate costs.

Statement 2 is correct. Firms investing in on-the-job training directly contribute to human capital formation. This training enhances the skills and productivity of workers, leading to higher output and efficiency for the firm. The firm's expenditure on training is an investment that yields a return in the form of improved labor productivity. The increased productivity translates into economic growth and contributes to the overall human capital stock of the nation.  This is a key aspect of human capital development that is often overlooked, but which represents a significant contribution to economic growth.


**3. With reference to agricultural productivity in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Except for wheat, the productivity of most crops in India is below the world average.
2.  The main reason for low cropping intensity in India is the lack of access to irrigation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India’s agricultural productivity, while showing improvement in certain crops like wheat, lags behind the world average for many other essential crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The adoption of conservation agriculture (CA) practices, such as no-till farming, requires specialized machinery that may not be readily available or affordable for many farmers, particularly small and marginal farmers.  The lack of access to appropriate technology is a significant barrier to the wider adoption of CA.  This technological gap needs to be addressed through investments in research, development, and dissemination of suitable machinery and equipment.  Furthermore, the existing agricultural infrastructure may not be well-suited to accommodate CA practices, leading to further challenges in adoption.

Statement 2 is correct.  Lack of awareness and knowledge about the benefits of conservation agriculture among farmers is a substantial impediment to its widespread adoption.  Many farmers may be unaware of the long-term benefits of CA, such as improved soil health, water conservation, and reduced environmental impact.  Effective extension services and farmer education programs are needed to disseminate information about CA practices and their advantages.  Building trust and confidence in CA through successful demonstrations and farmer-to-farmer interactions is crucial for overcoming the knowledge barrier.  Addressing this lack of awareness is vital for achieving the widespread adoption of CA.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) models are not standardized and uniformly applicable across all agro-climatic zones in India.  The design and implementation of IFS models are highly location-specific, taking into account the unique agro-ecological conditions, resource availability, and farmer preferences in each region.  A successful IFS model in one region may not be suitable or effective in another region with different climatic conditions or resource constraints.  The diversity of agro-climatic zones in India necessitates regionally differentiated approaches to IFS development and implementation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare has indeed prioritized IFS as a key strategy for achieving its goal of doubling farmers’ income by 2022.  IFS promotes diversification, resource efficiency, and risk mitigation, which are crucial for enhancing farm productivity and profitability.  The integration of various farming enterprises, such as crop production, livestock rearing, and aquaculture, helps to optimize resource utilization and reduce the dependence on a single income source, thereby improving the overall resilience and income stability of farmers.  The emphasis on IFS reflects a recognition of the need for sustainable and holistic approaches to agricultural development.


**7. With reference to the factors affecting the price of rice in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Minimum Support Price (MSP) for rice has no significant impact on its market price.
2. Government stockpiling of rice influences its market price.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for rice significantly impacts its market price.  MSP acts as a price floor, ensuring that farmers receive a minimum guaranteed price for their produce.  This price floor influences the overall market price, as traders and consumers are aware of the MSP and its impact on supply. While market forces still play a role, the MSP provides a safety net for farmers and directly affects the price dynamics of rice.  Government interventions through MSP are a crucial aspect of agricultural policy in India and directly affect rice prices.

Statement 2 is correct. Government stockpiling of rice directly influences its market price.  When the government holds large stocks of rice, it impacts the supply available in the market, thereby influencing prices.  The release of government stocks into the market can help to stabilize prices or bring them down during periods of scarcity or price spikes.  Conversely, low government stocks can lead to higher prices.  Therefore, government stockpiling is a significant factor in regulating rice prices and ensuring food security.  The management of government rice stocks is a strategic tool used by the government to maintain price stability and meet the needs of the population.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies low agricultural productivity as a major constraint on India's potential GDP. The significant gap between India's agricultural productivity and global averages, especially for crops beyond wheat, indicates untapped potential for increased agricultural output and overall economic growth.  Improving agricultural productivity is crucial for enhancing food security and boosting rural incomes, which are essential for overall economic development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A high capital-output ratio indicates that a large amount of capital investment is required to generate a unit of output.  While India has high savings, a high capital-output ratio means that these savings may not translate into proportionally high increases in output. This is because a substantial portion of investment may not be efficiently utilized or may be directed towards unproductive sectors.  Therefore, a high capital-output ratio acts as a constraint on economic growth, rather than a guarantee of increased output. The statement misinterprets the implication of a high capital-output ratio.


**9. With reference to the sources of growth within Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Improving livestock productivity is crucial, given the increasing share of livestock products in consumption expenditure.
2.  The low cropping intensity (due to limited irrigation) is not a significant constraint on agricultural output growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately points out the importance of enhancing livestock productivity. The increasing demand for livestock products, reflected in their growing share of consumption expenditure, necessitates improvements in livestock rearing practices, breeds, and veterinary care.  This is vital for boosting farmers' incomes and contributing to overall agricultural growth.  The statement correctly highlights the economic significance of livestock in the agricultural sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that low cropping intensity, largely due to limited access to irrigation, is a significant constraint on agricultural output growth.  A substantial portion of agricultural land remains underutilized, representing a missed opportunity for increasing production.  Improving irrigation infrastructure and promoting water-efficient farming techniques are crucial for raising cropping intensity and boosting agricultural output. The statement contradicts the information provided in the text about the impact of low cropping intensity.


**10. With reference to the challenges faced by Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The removal of fertilizer subsidies has increased production costs, particularly affecting small and marginal farmers.
2.  The WTO's policies have consistently protected Indian farmers from increased international competition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly points to the negative impact of removing fertilizer subsidies on small and marginal farmers.  Increased production costs due to higher fertilizer prices disproportionately affect these farmers, who often have limited resources to cope with rising input costs.  This highlights the social and economic implications of policy changes and the need for targeted support to vulnerable farmers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that WTO policies have exposed Indian farmers to increased international competition, negatively impacting their livelihoods.  The reduction in import duties on agricultural products and the removal of minimum support prices have made it difficult for Indian farmers to compete with cheaper imports.  This underscores the challenges faced by developing countries in navigating global trade agreements and the need for effective domestic policies to protect their farmers. The statement contradicts the actual impact of WTO policies on Indian farmers.



**1. With reference to the impact of the Green Revolution in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The initial phase of the Green Revolution primarily benefited wheat-growing regions and affluent states.
2.  The Green Revolution completely eliminated India's reliance on food grain imports by the early 1970s.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The initial adoption of High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds, fertilizers, and improved irrigation technologies associated with the Green Revolution was concentrated in relatively wealthier states like Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, largely focusing on wheat production.  Resource access and infrastructural limitations hindered widespread adoption in other regions and with other crops initially. The Green Revolution's initial impact was unevenly distributed across the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Green Revolution dramatically increased food grain production in India, leading to a significant reduction in imports and eventual self-sufficiency, it didn't completely eliminate reliance on imports by the early 1970s.  Import dependence fluctuated over time, influenced by factors like weather patterns, domestic demand, and global market conditions.  India achieved near self-sufficiency in food grains in the early 1970s, but complete independence from food imports was not achieved immediately.  Subsequent years saw periods of both surplus and deficit, necessitating occasional imports to maintain food security.  The claim of complete elimination of imports by the early 1970s is an overstatement of the Green Revolution's immediate impact.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Operation Flood:**

1. Operation Flood's three-tier structure involved village societies, district unions, and state federations, directly linking milk producers to consumers.
2.  The primary objective of Operation Flood was to achieve self-sufficiency in milk production by reducing reliance on imports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Operation Flood's success stemmed from its innovative three-tier cooperative structure.  Village societies aggregated milk production, district unions processed and marketed the milk, and state federations handled wider distribution and marketing. This vertical integration ensured fair prices for producers while providing efficient supply chains and consistent quality for consumers.  It effectively bypassed exploitative intermediaries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Operation Flood significantly increased milk production, its primary focus wasn't on eliminating milk imports.  India didn't have significant milk imports to begin with, unlike the situation with food grains before the Green Revolution. Operation Flood's main goals were to boost domestic milk production, increase rural incomes, and offer affordable milk to consumers. Self-sufficiency wasn't a primary objective, but rather a consequence of the program's success.


**3. With reference to the Agriculture Export Policy 2018, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy aimed to double agricultural exports within five years and reach $100 billion in subsequent years.
2.  A key recommendation was to maintain a stable trade policy regime with minimal state intervention in processed agricultural products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Agriculture Export Policy 2018 set an ambitious target of doubling agricultural exports from approximately $30 billion to over $60 billion by 2022, with a further goal of reaching $100 billion in the following years. This reflects India's intention to leverage its agricultural strength in the global market and improve farmers' incomes.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Recognizing the negative impacts of frequent changes in export policies on market stability and India's international reputation, a key recommendation was to establish a more stable and predictable policy environment.  The policy aimed to reduce ad-hoc interventions, particularly for processed and organic products, to foster greater confidence among international buyers and promote long-term growth in agricultural exports.  This aimed at projecting a more reliable image of India as a consistent supplier of high-quality agricultural goods.


**4. Consider the following statements about Minimum Support Prices (MSP) in India:**

1. MSP is a legally mandated price that private players are obligated to pay farmers for specified agricultural commodities.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) is a statutory body responsible for determining MSPs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  MSP is a government policy, not a legally binding price.  While the government announces MSPs for various crops, private players are not legally required to procure at those prices.  The MSP serves as a safety net for farmers, guaranteeing a minimum price for their produce, but market forces ultimately determine the prices paid.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CACP is an advisory body, not a statutory one.  It recommends MSPs to the government based on various factors, but the final decision on fixing and implementing MSPs rests with the government.  The lack of statutory status for CACP means its recommendations are not legally binding.


**5. With reference to the Indian food processing industry, consider the following statements:**

1. The majority of food processing enterprises in India are organized, contributing significantly to value addition.
2.  Inadequate infrastructure, particularly cold storage and logistics, poses a major challenge to the industry's growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian food processing industry is largely dominated by unorganized, small-scale enterprises. While organized players exist and contribute significantly to value addition, the vast majority of enterprises are small and lack the resources and infrastructure for large-scale processing and value addition.

Statement 2 is correct.  Inadequate infrastructure, especially cold storage facilities and efficient logistics networks, remains a critical constraint for India's food processing sector.  Perishable goods suffer significant losses due to lack of proper storage and transportation, leading to substantial economic losses and hindering the growth of the industry.  The fragmented and inefficient supply chain adds to the costs and challenges faced by the food processing industry.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the diversification of rural livelihoods in India:**

1. The mixed crop-livestock farming system prevalent in India provides income stability and food security for farmers.
2.  The IT sector has emerged as a major contributor to employment generation in rural areas, directly impacting poverty reduction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The traditional mixed farming system in India, where crop cultivation is integrated with livestock rearing, offers greater income stability and food security for farmers.  Livestock provide supplementary income streams and contribute to household nutrition, reducing dependence on a single source of income.  This reduces the vulnerability of farmers to crop failures or price fluctuations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While IT can play a role in rural development, it has not yet emerged as a major direct source of employment generation in rural India.  The impact of IT on rural employment is often indirect, through improved access to information, market linkages, and potentially through the creation of new opportunities in related sectors. However, direct job creation in the IT sector in rural areas remains limited due to infrastructural and skill-related limitations.  The statement overstates the current direct impact of IT on rural employment and poverty reduction.


**7. With reference to environmental challenges in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Land degradation in India is primarily caused by unsustainable agricultural practices, such as excessive use of agrochemicals and deforestation.
2.  India's high population density and livestock population exert enormous pressure on its finite land resources, leading to environmental degradation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Unsustainable agricultural practices, including excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, deforestation for agricultural expansion, and improper irrigation management contribute significantly to land degradation in India.  These practices deplete soil fertility, lead to soil erosion and water contamination, and disrupt ecological balance.

Statement 2 is also correct. India's exceptionally high population and livestock densities place immense pressure on land resources.  Competing demands for land for agriculture, forestry, housing, and industries lead to unsustainable land use practices, deforestation, and environmental degradation.  The high density exacerbates the challenges posed by other factors like unsustainable agricultural practices.  The limited land area available per capita intensifies the impact of these pressures.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided data, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the concepts, requiring recall of specific details.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  In Table 2.3, the Personal Disposable Income consistently exceeded the NNP at Factor Cost throughout the period 1990-91 to 2004-05.
2.  Table 2.4 shows that Private Final Consumption Expenditure consistently formed the largest component of the macroeconomic aggregates throughout the observed period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A careful examination of Table 2.3 reveals that while Personal Disposable Income is generally higher than NNP at Factor Cost, there are instances where this is not true.  The difference between the two varies year to year and is influenced by factors like indirect taxes, subsidies, and undistributed profits.  The statement presents an oversimplification of a complex relationship.

Statement 2 is correct.  Table 2.4 clearly indicates that Private Final Consumption Expenditure consistently surpasses Gross Domestic Capital Formation and Government Final Consumption Expenditure across all years presented.  This reflects the dominance of consumption in the Indian economy during this period, a pattern consistent with developing economies.  The substantial difference between Private Final Consumption Expenditure and other components makes this a robust and verifiable statement.


**2. With reference to the macroeconomic data presented in Tables 2.3 and 2.4, consider the following statements:**

1.  The data suggests a consistent positive correlation between Indirect Taxes and NNP at Factor Cost.
2.  The data reveals a consistent increase in Gross Domestic Capital Formation (Investment) from 1990-91 to 2004-05.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A visual inspection and basic trend analysis of Tables 2.3 and 2.4 demonstrate a general upward trend in both Indirect Taxes and NNP at Factor Cost over the period. While there might be minor year-to-year fluctuations, the overall direction suggests a positive correlation.  This is expected, as a growing economy typically generates higher tax revenues.  However, it's crucial to note that correlation does not equal causation; other factors influence both variables.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While there's a general upward trend in Gross Domestic Capital Formation, a closer look at Table 2.4 reveals significant year-to-year variations.  The increase is not consistent; some years show a decline or stagnation in investment.  This highlights the volatile nature of investment in developing economies and the influence of various economic cycles.  Therefore, the statement is an overgeneralization of the data.


**3. With reference to the "Money and Banking" section, consider the following statements:**

1.  The text argues that the primary function of money is to act as a store of value, ensuring wealth preservation for future use.
2.  The text explains that the transaction demand for money is directly proportional to the total value of transactions in an economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions that money serves as a store of value, it emphasizes that its *primary* function is to act as a medium of exchange.  The facilitation of transactions is presented as the most crucial role, overcoming the inefficiencies of barter systems. The store of value function is secondary, subject to the stability of the currency's purchasing power.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly introduces the equation M<sub>t</sub> = kT, where M<sub>t</sub> represents the transaction demand for money, T represents the total value of transactions, and k is a positive fraction. This equation directly demonstrates the proportionality between transaction demand and the volume of transactions. This is a fundamental concept in monetary economics.


**4.  Consider the following statements regarding the Indian economy as described in the provided text:**

1. The Green Revolution primarily benefited large farmers due to the high cost of inputs like HYV seeds and fertilizers.
2. The Green Revolution led to a significant reduction in the proportion of the population employed in agriculture by 1990.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While government subsidies aimed to mitigate this, the initial adoption of Green Revolution technologies, particularly HYV seeds, did disproportionately benefit larger, wealthier farmers who could afford the necessary inputs.  Small farmers faced challenges in accessing credit and resources, creating an initial disparity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that despite the Green Revolution's success, approximately 65% of India's population remained employed in agriculture even by 1990.  While agricultural productivity increased, the industrial and service sectors failed to absorb the surplus labor from agriculture, a key criticism of the economic policies of the time.


**5. With reference to the section on Rural Development, consider the following statements:**

1.  The success of milk cooperatives in Gujarat demonstrates the potential of cooperative models to improve both farmer incomes and consumer access to milk.
2.  The text suggests that the predominance of private trade in agricultural markets hinders efforts to improve farmer incomes and ensure food security for the poor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage explicitly cites the success of milk cooperatives in transforming the socio-economic landscape of Gujarat and other regions.  This highlights the cooperative model's ability to improve farmers' incomes through efficient marketing and processing while simultaneously benefiting consumers with better access to milk.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text points out that despite government interventions like MSP and PDS, private trade remains dominant in agricultural markets. This dominance, involving various intermediaries, often leads to farmers receiving a smaller share of the final price, hindering income growth and potentially impacting food security for the poor due to price fluctuations and inefficiencies in distribution.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the concepts of human capital formation as discussed in the text:**

1. Investment in health is considered a primary source of human capital formation, as it directly enhances the productivity of the labor force.
2. On-the-job training provided by firms is considered a secondary source of human capital formation, as its impact on overall productivity is less significant compared to formal education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly identifies investment in health as a crucial source of human capital formation.  A healthy workforce is more productive, leading to economic growth.  Preventive and curative healthcare, along with improvements in sanitation and clean water access, are highlighted as key investments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that on-the-job training is a significant source of human capital formation. Firms invest in training to enhance worker productivity, which directly benefits the firm's output and profitability. While formal education is also important, on-the-job training is presented as a crucial component of human capital development, not a secondary one.  The statement incorrectly downplays its importance.


**7. With reference to the discussion on employment in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The text indicates that the growth of employment in India has consistently outpaced the growth of GDP over the period 1960-2000.
2.  The text defines the informal sector as encompassing all enterprises employing fewer than ten hired workers, including self-employed individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that while GDP grew positively, employment growth was generally lower and experienced fluctuations.  The term "jobless growth" is used to describe periods where GDP growth outpaces employment growth, indicating a mismatch between economic expansion and job creation.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly defines the informal sector as including all enterprises with fewer than ten hired workers, along with the self-employed.  This accurately captures the significant portion of the Indian workforce operating outside the formal, regulated economy, lacking many of the social security benefits associated with formal employment.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the Indian economy's macroeconomic aggregates as presented in the provided data:**

1.  The data in Table 2.3 shows that, for the period 1990-91 to 2004-05,  NNP at Factor Cost consistently increased year on year.
2.  Based on Table 2.4,  Government Final Consumption Expenditure consistently increased as a proportion of the total macroeconomic aggregates from 1990-91 to 2004-05.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A review of Table 2.3 shows a clear upward trend in the NNP at Factor Cost across the years provided.  While the rate of increase may vary, the overall direction is positive, reflecting overall economic growth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Table 2.4 does not directly provide the proportion of Government Final Consumption Expenditure to the total.  It provides absolute values.  While the absolute value of Government Final Consumption Expenditure increases, determining whether its proportion to the total macroeconomic aggregates increases requires additional calculations and cannot be directly ascertained from the table.  The statement makes an unsupported assertion.


**9. With reference to the concept of GDP calculation methods, consider the following statements:**

1. The expenditure method of GDP calculation focuses on the aggregate value of final goods and services produced by all firms in the economy.
2. The income method of GDP calculation sums the total factor payments (wages, profits, rent, interest) received by all factors of production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The expenditure method of GDP calculation focuses on the total spending on final goods and services in the economy, not the value of goods produced. While the two are ultimately equal in a closed economy, the expenditure approach sums up consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.

Statement 2 is correct. The income method of GDP calculation directly sums up all the income generated in the economy from various factors of production. This includes wages, salaries, profits, rent, and interest earned by households and firms.  It's a direct measure of income generated from production activities.


**10. With reference to the discussion on money and banking, consider the following statements:**

1. Seigniorage refers to the profit earned by commercial banks from lending activities, contributing to their overall profitability.
2. The text describes the role of commercial banks as intermediaries between the central bank (RBI) and the public, facilitating the flow of money in the economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Seigniorage is explicitly defined in the text as the profit that accrues to the *central bank*, not commercial banks.  It's generated through the process of money creation and managing government securities, not through commercial lending.  The statement incorrectly attributes seigniorage to commercial banks.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly explains the role of commercial banks as intermediaries. They facilitate transactions between the central bank and the public, handling deposits, providing loans, and contributing to the efficient flow of money in the economy.  This description accurately reflects the function of commercial banks within a modern banking system.

The description of the CPCB's functions directly supports this statement. Thus, both statements accurately reflect the CPCB's roles and responsibilities as described in the text.


**3. With reference to the challenges faced by India’s agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Green Revolution, while increasing food grain production, initially benefited primarily affluent states and wheat-growing regions.
2.  Government interventions, such as subsidized fertilizers and low-interest loans, mitigated the risk of the Green Revolution exacerbating inequalities between large and small farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The passage explicitly states that the initial phase of the Green Revolution (mid-1960s to mid-1970s) saw the adoption of HYV seeds concentrated in wealthier states like Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, largely benefiting wheat-growing areas. This highlights the uneven distribution of benefits in the early stages.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text clearly explains that the government intervened to alleviate concerns about widening disparities between large and small farmers.  Subsidized inputs and credit access ensured that smaller farmers could also participate in and benefit from the Green Revolution technology. This government action counteracted the potential for increased inequality.  Therefore, both statements reflect the nuanced impact of the Green Revolution as described in the passage.


**4. With reference to the factors influencing agricultural productivity in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Improving livestock productivity is crucial for enhancing farmers' incomes, given the increasing share of livestock products in consumption expenditure.
2.  Increasing cropping intensity, by utilizing irrigation and new technologies to grow multiple crops annually, can significantly boost agricultural output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the importance of livestock productivity enhancement. The text highlights the role of livestock in the mixed farming system and emphasizes that growth in this sector must keep pace with rising demand to improve farmers' incomes.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage explicitly points out that India's cropping intensity is low, with only a fraction of net sown area utilized for a second crop.  It emphasizes the potential for increased production by maximizing land use through irrigation and improved technology to enhance cropping intensity.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect factors influencing agricultural productivity, as mentioned in the text.


**5.  With reference to India's agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The policy aims to achieve a substantial increase in agricultural exports within a specific timeframe, targeting a significant increase in export value.
2.  The policy emphasizes diversification of export products and destinations, prioritizing high-value and value-added agricultural exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the agricultural export policy aims to double agricultural exports from a specified amount to a significantly higher target within a defined timeframe. This numerical target is a key element of the policy's vision.

Statement 2 is also correct. The objectives of the policy explicitly include diversifying the export basket and destinations.  The focus on high-value and value-added products, such as perishables, is also prominently mentioned.  Both statements accurately reflect the goals and strategies outlined in the provided text regarding India's agricultural export policy.


**6. Consider the following statements related to the economic aspects of the Green Revolution:**

1.  A significant portion of the increased agricultural output during the Green Revolution was sold by farmers in the market, contributing to a decline in food grain prices.
2.  The Green Revolution's success in achieving food self-sufficiency was accompanied by a significant reduction in the percentage of the population employed in agriculture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that a substantial portion of the rice and wheat produced during the Green Revolution was sold as marketed surplus.  This led to a relative decline in food grain prices, benefiting low-income groups who spend a large portion of their income on food.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Green Revolution significantly increased agricultural productivity, the text points out that despite this, a large percentage of the population (around 65 percent) remained employed in agriculture even as late as 1990. This demonstrates that increased productivity did not lead to a commensurate reduction in agricultural employment during that period.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the economic aspects of the Green Revolution as described.


**7. With reference to the debate surrounding agricultural subsidies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Some economists advocate for phasing out agricultural subsidies once new technologies become widely adopted and profitable, arguing that subsidies are not cost-effective in the long run.
2.  Others argue that subsidies should continue because farming remains a risky business, and subsidies are crucial to ensure equity and prevent the marginalization of poor farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly represents one perspective on agricultural subsidies. Some economists argue that once a new technology proves profitable and is widely adopted, continuing subsidies becomes unnecessary and inefficient.  The argument is that subsidies should be temporary incentives, not a permanent feature.

Statement 2 also accurately reflects a contrasting viewpoint.  Many believe that subsidies are essential to mitigate the inherent risks in farming, particularly for poor farmers who lack the financial resources to invest without support.  The equity argument emphasizes the need to protect vulnerable farmers.  Therefore, both statements represent valid and opposing positions in the ongoing debate about agricultural subsidies in India.


**8. With reference to the National Bamboo Mission in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The mission aims to increase the area under bamboo cultivation, primarily on non-forest government and private lands, to supplement farmers' income and enhance the availability of raw materials for industries.
2.  The mission focuses solely on increasing production and overlooks the need for improvements in post-harvest management and marketing of bamboo products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key objective of the National Bamboo Mission. The mission's goal to increase bamboo cultivation on various land types to boost farmers' income and provide raw materials for industries is clearly stated in the provided text.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the mission addresses post-harvest management, including establishing processing units and improving market infrastructure.  This demonstrates that the mission is not solely production-focused but also considers the entire value chain.  Therefore, only statement 1 correctly reflects the National Bamboo Mission's aims and strategies.


**9. Consider the following statements about Genetically Modified (GM) crops in India:**

1.  The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) is the regulatory body responsible for approving GM crops in India, operating under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
2.  India currently permits the commercial cultivation of a wide range of GM crops, including BT brinjal, reflecting a liberal approach to GM technology adoption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage correctly identifies the GEAC as the apex body regulating GM crops in India, operating under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.  Its role in evaluating and approving GM crops is clearly described.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India currently allows commercial production of only one GM crop, BT cotton.  BT brinjal, although having passed field trials, has not been approved for commercial cultivation due to a moratorium and opposition from civil society groups.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the current situation regarding GM crops in India.


**10. With reference to the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights (PPVFR) Act, 2001, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act grants breeders the exclusive right to produce, sell, and market their protected plant varieties, ensuring their intellectual property rights.
2. The Act explicitly excludes the patenting of seeds, plants, and their varieties, aligning with a policy of protecting farmers' rights and promoting biodiversity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PPVFR Act grants breeders certain rights, including the rights to produce, sell, market, distribute, export, and import protected varieties. This is a key aspect of the Act, aimed at protecting breeders' intellectual property rights.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text mentions the government's argument in court cases involving Monsanto, stating that the Indian Patents Act excludes patenting of seeds, plants, and their varieties. This reflects the Act’s policy of balancing breeders' rights with the protection of farmers' rights and the preservation of biodiversity.  Therefore, both statements accurately represent provisions and the underlying philosophy of the PPVFR Act, 2001.



Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer, a detailed explanation, and analysis of distractors.


**1. With reference to the factors influencing agricultural productivity in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The productivity of most crops in India, except wheat, is below the world average and significantly lower than in agriculturally advanced nations.
2.  Variations in yield across Indian states are primarily attributed to differences in access to irrigation, technological advancements playing a secondary role.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the reality of Indian agriculture. While wheat production has seen significant improvements, many other crops lag behind global benchmarks in terms of yield due to various factors including technological limitations and resource constraints.  This disparity highlights the need for targeted interventions to boost productivity in other crucial crops.  The statement is supported by the text's explicit mention of low productivity in crops other than wheat compared to global averages.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While unequal access to irrigation significantly impacts agricultural yields across states, the text emphasizes that both enhanced irrigation access *and* technological advancements are crucial for increasing productivity.  Attributing the variation solely to irrigation access overlooks the critical role of technology in achieving higher yields.  Technological advancements, including improved seeds, fertilizers, and farming practices, are equally important drivers of productivity.  The text explicitly states that both are "potent instruments" for raising agricultural productivity.


**2.  With reference to the Agriculture Export Policy 2018 in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The policy aims to eliminate export restrictions on processed agricultural products and organic products, irrespective of restrictions on primary agricultural commodities.
2.  The policy primarily focuses on increasing the volume of agricultural exports, with less emphasis on value addition and diversification of export destinations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects a key objective of the Agriculture Export Policy 2018.  The policy explicitly aims to create a stable and predictable trade policy regime, minimizing government intervention and ensuring that processed and organic products are not subjected to export restrictions even if primary agricultural goods are. This aims to enhance India's reliability as a global supplier. The text clearly states the policy's intention to provide "policy assurance" for processed and organic products, differentiating them from primary agricultural goods.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The policy's vision explicitly aims to "double agricultural exports" but also emphasizes diversification of the export basket, destinations, and a strong focus on high-value and value-added products.  The policy prioritizes integrating Indian farmers into global value chains, implying a focus on both volume and value addition. The text explicitly mentions objectives concerning diversification of the export basket, destinations, and a boost in high-value exports.


**3. With reference to the sources of growth within the Indian agricultural sector (as per the Dalwai Committee), consider the following statements:**

1.  Improving livestock productivity is less critical than increasing cropping intensity, given the over-dependence on agriculture and the need to shift labor to non-farm sectors.
2.  Improving the terms of trade for farmers requires aligning farm produce prices with the overall inflation rate, ensuring that real farmer incomes rise.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Dalwai Committee report clearly identifies improving livestock productivity as a major source of growth within agriculture, highlighting the importance of mixed farming systems and the need to meet rising demand for livestock products.  The text explicitly mentions livestock's "important role" and the need for growth in this sector to match rising consumption.  Dismissing livestock productivity as less critical than cropping intensity ignores the significant economic contribution and potential of this sector.

Statement 2 is partially correct but incomplete. While aligning farm produce prices with inflation is crucial for maintaining real farmer incomes, the statement is too simplistic. The text explains that real income increases when prices received by farmers rise *faster* than inflation, even without an increase in output volume.  Simply aligning prices with inflation would only maintain, not necessarily improve, real incomes.  The text explicitly highlights the importance of price increases exceeding inflation to boost real farmer income.


**4. With reference to the Green and White Revolutions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Green Revolution, primarily focused on wheat initially, later expanded to rice cultivation, significantly increasing food grain production and leading to self-sufficiency.
2.  Operation Flood, a cornerstone of the White Revolution, involved a three-tier cooperative structure, empowering milk producers and ensuring reasonable consumer prices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the phases of the Green Revolution in India.  It correctly notes the initial focus on wheat in high-irrigation areas, followed by its expansion to rice and other crops, ultimately contributing to India achieving self-sufficiency in food grain production.  The text explicitly details the phases of the Green Revolution and its impact on food grain production.

Statement 2 accurately describes the structure and impact of Operation Flood.  It correctly identifies the three-tier cooperative structure (village society, district union, state federation) that was instrumental in transforming the dairy sector, empowering milk producers, increasing milk production, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers.  The text provides a detailed description of the three-tier structure and its achievements.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding Minimum Support Prices (MSP) in India:**

1.  The MSP is a legally binding commitment by the government to purchase all agricultural produce at the announced price from all farmers across India.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) is a statutory body that determines MSPs based solely on the cost of production, ignoring market dynamics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MSP is a government policy, not a legally enforceable right for farmers.  The government is not obligated to purchase all produce at MSP, and the procurement is limited to certain crops and regions. The text explicitly states that MSP has "no legal backing" and that the government cannot force private players to procure at MSP.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the cost of production is a major factor considered by the CACP, it is not the sole determinant.  The CACP also takes into account market demand and supply, domestic and international price trends, and other economic factors when recommending MSPs. The text clearly indicates that CACP considers a range of factors, including cost of production, demand and supply, and market trends, when recommending MSPs.


**6. With reference to the challenges faced by the Indian fishing community, consider the following statements:**

1.  The inland fishing sector contributes a larger share to India's total fish production compared to the marine sector.
2.  Women in the fishing community are primarily involved in fishing activities, with minimal participation in marketing and export.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the marine sector contributes 51% to total fish production, while inland sources contribute 49%.  This directly contradicts the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While women might not be directly involved in fishing at sea, the text highlights that they constitute a significant part of the workforce in export and internal marketing of fish products. This directly contradicts the statement.  The text specifies that women constitute about 60% of the export marketing workforce and 40% of the internal marketing workforce in the fishing sector.


**7. With reference to the concept of human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Investment in education is the sole primary source of human capital formation, while other factors like health and on-the-job training play a minor role.
2.  Migration of skilled workers to other countries for higher salaries contributes negatively to human capital formation in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly lists several sources of human capital formation, including education, health, on-the-job training, and migration.  It does not prioritize education as the *sole* primary source, but rather highlights the importance of multiple factors contributing to human capital development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the emigration of skilled workers represents a loss of human capital for India, the text does not characterize this as entirely negative.  The text acknowledges that migration involves costs but also highlights that enhanced earnings in the new place outweigh the costs. This implies that while there's a loss for India, it's not solely negative from an individual perspective and contributes to human capital formation in the receiving country.


**8. With reference to the fertilizer subsidy regime in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) system applies to all major fertilizers, including urea, DAP, and MOP, ensuring a uniform subsidy rate across all nutrients.
2.  The introduction of neem-coated urea aims to enhance fertilizer efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and prevent illegal diversion for industrial use.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NBS system applies only to DAP and MOP fertilizers, while urea has a separate subsidy mechanism.  The text explicitly states that the subsidy regime for DAP and MOP is NBS, while urea has a different system.  The subsidy rates also differ across nutrients within the NBS system.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly explains that neem-coated urea is mandated to improve efficiency, reduce environmental damage from leaching, and curb its misuse in industries.  The benefits of neem coating, including slower nitrogen release and reduced water contamination, are clearly mentioned in the text.



**9.  With reference to the employment scenario in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The primary sector continues to be the largest employer in India, with a majority of the workforce engaged in agriculture and related activities.
2.  The growth of employment in India has consistently outpaced the growth of the GDP over the past few decades, leading to a significant reduction in unemployment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India remains largely an agrarian economy, with agriculture and allied activities employing a substantial portion of the workforce. The text supports this by stating that the primary sector is the main source of employment for a majority of workers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions "jobless growth," indicating that GDP growth has not been accompanied by commensurate employment growth. In fact, the rate of employment growth has fluctuated and even declined in certain periods, contradicting the statement's claim of consistent outpacing of GDP growth. The text explicitly mentions a widening gap between GDP and employment growth, indicating jobless growth.


**10. Consider the following statements concerning the challenges faced by Indian agriculture:**

1.  The small and marginal landholding pattern in India hinders the development of export-oriented clusters for horticultural products due to low production volumes and standardization issues.
2.  The dominance of private trade in agricultural markets, alongside government interventions like MSP, effectively protects farmers' incomes and ensures fair prices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a major challenge in developing export-oriented clusters for horticultural products in India.  The small landholdings and lack of standardization among farmers pose significant obstacles to meeting the volume and quality requirements of international markets. The text explicitly highlights the challenges posed by small landholdings and low farmer awareness in achieving the volumes and standardization needed for horticultural exports.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While government interventions like MSP aim to protect farmers' income, private trade still dominates agricultural markets, leading to price volatility and exploitation of farmers. The text explicitly points out that private trade predominates, handling 90% of agricultural products, while government agencies and cooperatives handle only 10%.  This indicates that government interventions alone are insufficient to guarantee fair prices and protect farmers’ income.


**1. With reference to the impact of economic growth on development, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in absolute and per capita real GNP does not necessarily signify higher economic development if poverty and unemployment rates rise concurrently.
2.  High savings rates in an economy do not automatically translate into significant output increases if the capital-output ratio is high.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While increases in absolute and per capita real GNP are generally positive indicators of economic growth, they don't fully encapsulate the concept of economic development.  Economic development encompasses broader societal improvements, including poverty reduction and employment generation. If GNP increases are accompanied by rising poverty and unemployment, it suggests that the benefits of growth aren't being distributed equitably, and the overall development level remains stagnant or even deteriorates.  This highlights the importance of inclusive growth, where the benefits of economic expansion reach all segments of society.

Statement 2 is also correct. A high savings rate is crucial for capital formation, which is essential for economic growth. However, a high capital-output ratio indicates that a large amount of capital investment is needed to produce a unit of output.  This could be due to various factors, including technological inefficiencies, poor resource allocation, or infrastructural bottlenecks. Even with high savings, if the capital-output ratio is high, the resulting increase in output may be insignificant, hindering substantial economic growth.  This emphasizes the need for efficient capital allocation and technological advancements to maximize the impact of savings on output.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect important nuances in understanding the relationship between economic growth and development.


**2. With reference to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and India's economic standing, consider the following statements:**

1.  PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services across different nations.
2.  Based on PPP, India's position is among the top six largest economies globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It aims to determine the relative value of currencies by comparing the prices of the same goods and services in different countries.  By adjusting for differences in price levels, PPP provides a more accurate comparison of economic output and living standards than nominal exchange rates, which can be influenced by short-term market fluctuations.  This is a crucial concept in international economics for comparing the relative size and strength of economies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's economy has grown significantly, its ranking among the world's largest economies varies depending on the metric used.  While India consistently ranks highly using PPP, it does not consistently feature in the top six largest economies globally when using nominal GDP. The difference stems from the fact that PPP adjusts for price differences, whereas nominal GDP uses current exchange rates.  Nominal GDP often understates the true size of economies with lower price levels like India.  Therefore, while India's PPP-adjusted GDP is substantial, its ranking among the top six is not consistently supported by data.


**3. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPI assigns a greater weight to food items compared to the WPI.
2.  The WPI does not account for service price changes, a factor the CPI incorporates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures changes in the price level of consumer goods and services.  Food items typically constitute a larger proportion of household expenditure in many developing economies, including India. As a result, the CPI gives a higher weightage to food prices.  This reflects the fact that changes in food prices directly and significantly impact the purchasing power and living standards of a large section of the population.  The Wholesale Price Index (WPI), on the other hand, focuses on wholesale prices and may not accurately reflect the relative importance of food in consumer budgets.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The WPI primarily tracks price changes at the wholesale level, which mainly includes goods.  Services, which constitute a growing portion of many economies, are largely excluded from the WPI calculation.  In contrast, the CPI includes both goods and services, providing a more comprehensive picture of inflation as experienced by consumers.  The difference in scope between the CPI and WPI is significant because it affects the accuracy of inflation measures and their implications for policymaking.  Therefore, both statements are correct and highlight the key differences between these two crucial inflation indices.


**4. With reference to factors affecting market demand, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the price of a substitute good leads to a rise in the market demand for the original good.
2.  A decrease in the price of a complementary good increases the market demand for the original good.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of one another. If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper alternative good, leading to an increase in its demand.  This is a fundamental principle of demand and supply, highlighting the substitutability of goods in consumer choice.  For example, if the price of coffee rises, consumers might switch to tea, increasing the demand for tea.

Statement 2 is also correct. Complementary goods are those that are consumed together. If the price of a complementary good decreases, it becomes more affordable to consume both goods together. This will lead to an increase in demand for both goods. This demonstrates the complementary relationship between goods and how changes in the price of one affect the demand for the other. For example, if the price of petrol decreases, the demand for cars (and petrol) may increase because driving becomes cheaper.  Thus, both statements correctly describe the effects of price changes on the demand for goods in relation to their substitutes and complements.


**5. With reference to the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), consider the following statements:**

1. A rise in NEER indicates an appreciation of the domestic currency.
2. An increase in REER signifies improved trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is an index that measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies. An increase in NEER signifies that the domestic currency has appreciated relative to the basket of currencies. This means that it takes fewer units of the domestic currency to purchase one unit of foreign currency.  This is a key indicator used in international finance to assess currency movements and their potential impact on trade and capital flows.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) adjusts the NEER for inflation differentials between the domestic economy and its trading partners.  An increase in REER doesn't necessarily indicate improved trade competitiveness.  In fact, a rise in REER means the domestic currency has become more expensive relative to foreign currencies, considering inflation. This can make exports less competitive and imports more attractive, potentially leading to a deterioration in the trade balance.  Therefore, while NEER directly reflects currency appreciation, REER's effect on trade competitiveness is more nuanced and complex, depending on various other economic factors.


**6. With reference to India's potential GDP and its determinants, consider the following statements:**

1. Potential GDP is determined by factors such as the availability of resources, technological advancements, and institutional quality.
2.  Factors hindering India from realizing its potential GDP include inadequate infrastructure and skill deficiencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Potential GDP represents the maximum output an economy can produce when all its resources are fully utilized efficiently.  Several factors determine an economy's potential GDP. These include the quantity and quality of its resources (labor, capital, natural resources), technological progress, and the efficiency of its institutions (governance, legal framework, property rights).  A well-functioning economy with abundant resources, advanced technology, and strong institutions has higher potential GDP compared to one with limited resources, outdated technology, and weak institutions.  This is a fundamental concept in macroeconomics used to assess an economy's long-term growth capacity.

Statement 2 is also correct.  India's actual GDP often falls short of its potential GDP due to various constraints.  Inadequate infrastructure, including poor transportation networks, unreliable power supply, and deficient irrigation systems, limits the efficient utilization of resources and production.  Skill deficiencies, particularly in the workforce, hinder technological adoption and productivity improvements.  These factors, along with other bottlenecks like bureaucratic inefficiencies and policy inconsistencies, prevent the economy from achieving its full productive potential. Addressing these constraints is crucial for India to achieve higher economic growth and development.


**7. With reference to the Indian economy's recent performance, consider the following statements:**

1.  A V-shaped recovery implies a sharp decline followed by an equally rapid and complete recovery.
2. The Indian economy’s recent recovery has been characterized by a swift rebound in key economic indicators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A V-shaped recovery is a specific type of economic recovery characterized by a sharp, rapid decline in economic activity, followed by an equally sharp and rapid recovery.  The "V" shape graphically represents this pattern, with the bottom of the "V" marking the trough of the recession and the upward slope representing the swift rebound.  This contrasts with other recovery patterns, such as U-shaped (slow recovery) or L-shaped (prolonged stagnation). The speed and completeness of the recovery are key characteristics of a V-shaped pattern.

Statement 2 is incorrect or at best, debatable.  While the Indian economy has shown signs of recovery following economic downturns, characterizing it as a complete V-shaped recovery requires a deeper analysis. The speed and extent of the recovery in various sectors and indicators need to be thoroughly examined.  Some sectors might have experienced a V-shaped recovery, while others might have shown a different pattern. The claim requires a comprehensive review of various economic indicators, considering factors like employment, investment, and overall consumption to determine whether the recovery truly meets the criteria of a V-shaped pattern.


**8. With reference to seigniorage, consider the following statements:**

1. Seigniorage is the profit a central bank earns from money creation.
2.  Sources of seigniorage include interest income on reserves and the inflation tax.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Seigniorage refers to the profit a central bank makes from issuing currency.  The central bank incurs costs in printing and distributing currency, but the face value of the currency issued exceeds these costs, generating a profit for the bank. This profit is a source of revenue for the government, although it's important to note that excessive seigniorage can be inflationary.  This concept is vital in understanding the relationship between monetary policy and government finance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Interest income on reserves held by the central bank is one source of seigniorage.  Banks are required to maintain certain reserves with the central bank, and these reserves earn interest, contributing to the central bank's profits. Another source is the "inflation tax," which arises when inflation erodes the real value of money held by the public.  As the value of currency decreases due to inflation, the real value of the central bank's liabilities falls, effectively increasing its seigniorage.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe seigniorage and its sources within a monetary system.


**9. With reference to the functions of money, consider the following statements:**

1. Money serves as a medium of exchange, simplifying transactions compared to barter systems.
2. Money acts as a store of value, enabling the deferral of consumption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The primary function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions between individuals and businesses.  Without money, economic activity would rely on barter, which requires a "double coincidence of wants" – two parties each needing what the other possesses.  This makes transactions cumbersome and inefficient.  Money eliminates this problem, allowing for a smoother and more efficient flow of goods and services in the economy.  This is a fundamental concept in understanding the development of market economies.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Money serves as a store of value, allowing individuals to save their purchasing power for future use.  While other assets can also store value (e.g., gold, real estate), money offers greater liquidity and ease of use.  This function of money is essential for investment, savings, and the overall functioning of financial markets.  However, it's crucial to remember that the value of money can be eroded by inflation, limiting its effectiveness as a long-term store of value.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe important functions that money plays in an economy.


**10. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme aims to integrate small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.
2.  It provides loans specifically for agricultural purposes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) is a government initiative designed to provide financial assistance to micro and small businesses.  A primary objective is to bring these enterprises into the formal financial system, giving them access to credit and other financial services.  Many small businesses operate informally, lacking access to formal banking. MUDRA aims to address this gap, promoting entrepreneurship and economic growth.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While MUDRA Yojana supports micro and small businesses, its focus is not limited to agriculture. It provides loans for various non-agricultural activities as well. The scheme aims to support a broad range of micro-enterprises, fostering job creation and economic diversification.  Therefore, while MUDRA has indirect positive impacts on the agricultural sector by supporting related businesses, it does not directly provide loans specifically for agricultural purposes.


**11. With reference to the Government's Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. Both schemes aim to bring idle gold held by households into the economy.
2. A key objective is to reduce India's reliance on gold imports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are designed to mobilize the large amount of gold held as idle assets in households across India.  By encouraging people to invest in these schemes, the government aims to channel this gold into the formal financial system, increasing the availability of gold for productive uses and reducing reliance on imports.  This is a crucial policy initiative aimed at improving the efficiency of resource allocation and strengthening the domestic financial system.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A significant objective of both schemes is to reduce India's dependence on gold imports.  India is a major importer of gold, creating a drain on foreign exchange reserves.  By increasing domestic gold availability through these schemes, the government aims to lessen the need for imports, improving the country's balance of payments and strengthening its macroeconomic stability.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the primary goals and objectives of these important gold-related schemes.


**12. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1. NPCI plays a role in promoting financial inclusion in India.
2.  NPCI is solely responsible for the creation and management of RuPay, a domestic card payment network.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a crucial institution in India's financial system. It facilitates several payment systems, including IMPS (Immediate Payment Service), UPI (Unified Payments Interface), and RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement).  These systems have significantly promoted financial inclusion by providing convenient and affordable access to digital payment services, particularly in rural and underserved areas.  This has led to increased participation in the financial system, boosting economic activity and reducing dependence on cash transactions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NPCI launched RuPay, it's not solely responsible for its management.  RuPay is a domestic card payment network operated under the aegis of NPCI, but its operational management and expansion involve collaboration with various banks and financial institutions.  Therefore, although NPCI played a crucial role in the creation and initial launch of RuPay,  its management is a collaborative effort, and attributing sole responsibility to NPCI is inaccurate.


**13. With reference to the objectives of Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SFBs primarily focus on providing credit to small business units.
2.  A key objective is to encourage entrepreneurship, especially in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Small Finance Banks (SFBs) were introduced in India to address the credit needs of underserved segments of the population, particularly small businesses and micro-enterprises.  These banks are specifically designed to cater to the financial requirements of small businesses, providing them with easier access to credit and other financial services. This is a critical step in promoting entrepreneurship and economic growth at the grassroots level.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A key aim of establishing SFBs is to promote entrepreneurship and financial inclusion in rural and underserved areas.  By providing financial services to individuals and businesses in these regions, SFBs help to create jobs, stimulate local economies, and reduce economic disparities.  This is consistent with the broader government objective of inclusive growth and development.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the core objectives and functions of SFBs in the Indian financial landscape.


**14. With reference to the "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1. MDR is an incentive given by banks to merchants for accepting debit card payments.
2.  MDR is a charge levied by banks on merchants for processing debit card transactions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is not an incentive given to merchants. Instead, it is a fee or charge that banks levy on merchants for processing debit and credit card payments.  This fee covers the costs associated with the transaction, including payment processing, risk management, and network fees.  The MDR is a crucial element in the functioning of electronic payment systems, influencing the adoption of digital payments by merchants.

Statement 2 is correct.  MDR is a fee that merchants pay to banks for accepting card payments.  The rate varies depending on factors such as the type of card (debit or credit), the transaction value, and the acquiring bank's policies.  Understanding the MDR is essential for merchants to assess the costs associated with accepting electronic payments and for policymakers to design effective policies promoting digital transactions.  Therefore, while statement 1 presents a misconception, statement 2 accurately defines the MDR.


**15. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Legal tender money is money that creditors are legally obligated to accept as payment.
2.  Cheques and drafts qualify as legal tender money.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Legal tender money refers to currency or coins that a creditor is legally required to accept in settlement of a debt.  This is a fundamental aspect of a monetary system, ensuring that currency issued by the government is universally acceptable for transactions and debt repayment.  The legal tender status is usually defined by law, and refusal to accept legal tender can have legal consequences.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Cheques and drafts are not legal tender.  They are instruments of payment representing a promise to pay, but they are not legally mandated for acceptance.  A creditor can refuse a cheque or draft, unlike legal tender.  The distinction between legal tender and other forms of payment is crucial for understanding the structure and functioning of a monetary system.  Therefore, while statement 1 correctly describes legal tender, statement 2 misrepresents its nature.


**16. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) functions, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI manages both central and state government securities.
2.  State governments issue treasury bills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) primarily manages and services the securities issued by the central government (Government of India). It does not directly manage or service securities issued by state governments.  This division of responsibility reflects the federal structure of the Indian government.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued by the central government to meet its short-term borrowing needs.  State governments do not typically issue treasury bills in the same manner as the central government.  This difference in borrowing mechanisms reflects the distinct financial responsibilities and powers of the central and state governments.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect, reflecting a misunderstanding of the RBI's role and the government's borrowing practices.


**17. With reference to the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), consider the following statements:**

1. CAR is the amount banks maintain as their own funds to cover potential losses from non-repayment of loans.
2.  Each bank independently decides its CAR.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a regulatory requirement for banks to maintain a minimum level of capital relative to their risk-weighted assets. This capital acts as a buffer to absorb potential losses arising from loan defaults or other financial risks.  The CAR is a crucial element in banking regulation, aimed at ensuring the stability and soundness of the banking system.  A higher CAR generally indicates a stronger bank, better equipped to withstand financial shocks.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAR is not decided independently by each bank.  It is a regulatory requirement set by supervisory authorities, such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in India, to maintain a minimum level of capital.  While banks may have internal capital planning processes, the final CAR level must meet the regulatory standards.  Therefore, while statement 1 correctly defines CAR, statement 2 reflects a misunderstanding of its regulatory nature.


**18. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deposits are considered assets for a commercial bank.
2.  Advances (loans) are considered assets for a commercial bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Deposits are liabilities for a commercial bank, not assets.  Deposits represent money that the bank owes to its customers, forming a part of the bank's obligations.  These funds are used by the bank for lending and investments.

Statement 2 is correct. Advances, or loans, are assets for a commercial bank.  When a bank makes a loan, it acquires an asset representing the borrower's obligation to repay the principal and interest.  These loans are a major source of income and profitability for banks.  Therefore, while statement 1 reflects a common misconception, statement 2 correctly identifies a key component of a bank's assets.


**19. With reference to factors reducing the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Remittances from Indians working abroad contribute to forex reserves and reduce currency risks.
2.  Increased government expenditure generally strengthens the currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Remittances from Indians working abroad are a significant source of foreign exchange earnings for India.  These inflows increase the country's foreign exchange reserves, strengthening its balance of payments and reducing the vulnerability to currency crises.  Larger reserves provide a buffer against external shocks and speculative attacks on the currency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Increased government expenditure, especially if not financed by increased productivity or revenues, can be inflationary and weaken the currency.  Higher inflation can make the domestic currency less attractive, potentially leading to capital flight and currency depreciation, increasing the risk of a currency crisis.  Therefore, while remittances provide a stabilizing influence, increased government spending can have the opposite effect.


**20. With reference to measures taken by the government/RBI to prevent the depreciation of the Indian rupee, consider the following statements:**

1.  Curbing imports of non-essential goods and promoting exports are common measures.
2.  Following an expansionary monetary policy is typically used to support the currency.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Curbing imports of non-essential goods helps reduce the demand for foreign currency, supporting the domestic currency's value.  Simultaneously, promoting exports increases the supply of foreign currency, further strengthening the rupee.  These are common measures used by governments and central banks to manage exchange rates and maintain macroeconomic stability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy, which involves increasing money supply, typically leads to inflation and can weaken a currency.  To support the currency during a depreciation crisis, a contractionary monetary policy (reducing money supply) is more commonly employed.  This can raise interest rates, attracting foreign investment and increasing demand for the domestic currency.  Therefore, statement 1 correctly identifies a common approach, while statement 2 reflects a misunderstanding of monetary policy's impact on exchange rates.


**21. With reference to factors influencing the money multiplier, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) increases the money multiplier.
2.  Increased banking habits among the population increase the money multiplier.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The money multiplier is inversely related to the cash reserve ratio (CRR).  A higher CRR means banks have to keep a larger portion of their deposits as reserves, leaving less for lending. This reduces the money multiplier, as less money is created through the lending process.

Statement 2 is correct.  Increased banking habits among the population lead to a greater proportion of money held in bank deposits rather than as cash.  This increases the amount of money available for banks to lend, thus increasing the money multiplier.  A higher money multiplier signifies a more efficient banking system in creating credit and expanding the money supply.


**22. With reference to actions that could provide immunity to India during a global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1.  Not depending on short-term foreign borrowings is a prudent strategy.
2.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility enhances vulnerability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Reliance on short-term foreign borrowings increases vulnerability to global financial crises.  During crises, international capital flows can reverse quickly, making it difficult for countries with substantial short-term debt to repay their obligations.  Reducing reliance on short-term debt strengthens a country's resilience to external shocks.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While full capital account convertibility offers certain benefits like increased capital inflows, it also increases vulnerability to sudden reversals in capital flows during global financial crises.  Controlled capital account management can help mitigate this vulnerability. Therefore, limiting reliance on short-term debt is a crucial strategy, while the impact of capital account convertibility is more complex and context-dependent.


**23. With reference to the immediate effect of a large cash withdrawal from a demand deposit account, consider the following statements:**

1.  The aggregate money supply decreases by the amount withdrawn.
2.  The aggregate money supply remains unchanged.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. When a large sum of cash is withdrawn from a demand deposit account, the immediate effect is a reduction in the money supply by the amount withdrawn. Demand deposits are considered part of the money supply (M1), and the withdrawal translates directly into a decrease in the overall money supply.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The withdrawal of cash from a demand deposit account directly affects the money supply.  While the effects might be mitigated over time through other banking activities, the immediate impact is a reduction in the money supply equivalent to the amount withdrawn.  Therefore, statement 1 correctly describes the immediate impact, while statement 2 is an inaccurate representation.


**24. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  KCC provides short-term credit for working capital and post-harvest expenses.
2.  KCC funds are available for constructing family houses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme is a credit facility specifically designed for farmers.  It provides short-term credit for various agricultural purposes, including working capital for cultivation, purchase of inputs, and post-harvest expenses.  This credit support helps farmers manage their cash flows throughout the agricultural cycle.

Statement 2 is incorrect. KCC credit is primarily intended for agricultural activities.  It does not provide funding for non-agricultural purposes like constructing family houses or setting up village cold storage facilities.  These are typically financed through other schemes or lending channels.  Therefore, statement 1 accurately reflects the KCC's core purpose, while statement 2 misrepresents its scope.


**25. With reference to different financial instruments, consider the following statements:**

1.  Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note.
2.  Call money is a short-term borrowing instrument used in interbank transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds.  It is an important instrument in the money market, providing a source of financing for companies with good credit ratings.

Statement 2 is also correct. Call money is a short-term borrowing instrument used primarily in interbank transactions.  Banks use call money to manage their short-term liquidity needs, borrowing or lending funds for a short period (typically overnight).  It's a crucial component of the interbank money market, ensuring liquidity and efficient functioning of the banking system.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe these short-term financial instruments.


**26. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI primarily involves investment in listed companies through capital instruments.
2. FDI is largely a non-debt-creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FDI can involve investment in listed companies, it is not limited to this.  FDI encompasses a broader range of investments, including equity participation in both listed and unlisted companies, establishment of new businesses, and mergers and acquisitions.  Therefore, restricting FDI to investments in only listed companies through capital instruments is an oversimplification.

Statement 2 is correct.  FDI is primarily equity-based investment, representing a direct ownership stake in a business.  Unlike debt financing, FDI does not involve debt servicing obligations.  This makes FDI a relatively stable and long-term source of capital for recipient countries.  Therefore, while statement 1 is an oversimplification, statement 2 accurately reflects a key characteristic of FDI.


**27. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Government appoints the Governor of the RBI.
2. The RBI Governor derives authority from the RBI Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is appointed by the Central Government of India.  This reflects the government's ultimate oversight of the central bank, although the RBI operates with a significant degree of autonomy in its day-to-day operations.

Statement 2 is also correct. The RBI Governor's powers and functions are primarily derived from the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.  This Act provides the legal framework for the RBI's operations, defining its role in monetary policy, banking regulation, and other crucial functions.  Therefore, both statements correctly describe the appointment process and the legal basis of the RBI Governor's authority.


**28. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. UCBs are supervised and regulated by local boards established by state governments.
2. UCBs can issue equity and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (diverse topics across multiple sections), creating MCQs that meet all criteria and avoid repetition while remaining challenging within the token limit is difficult. Therefore, the number of questions generated may be less than expected.


**1. With reference to the functioning of Milk Cooperatives in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The success of milk cooperatives in transforming the socio-economic landscape of Gujarat and other parts of the country highlights their significant role in benefiting both farmers and consumers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states the success of milk cooperatives in Gujarat and elsewhere, benefiting both farmers and consumers (statement 1). It also directly points to inadequate farmer member coverage, insufficient marketing-processing links, and inefficient financial management as reasons for recent setbacks (statement 2).  Therefore, both statements are accurate reflections of the text's information. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the validity of both statements, which are directly supported by the provided text.


**2. With reference to alternative marketing channels for agricultural produce in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Apni Mandi (Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan), Hadaspar Mandi (Pune), Rythu Bazars (Andhra Pradesh), and Uzhavar Sandies (Tamil Nadu) are examples of systems where farmers sell directly to consumers, increasing their share of consumer prices.
2.  National and multinational fast-food chains are increasingly forming contracts with farmers, ensuring desired quality produce at pre-decided prices, thereby reducing price risks for farmers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The passage explicitly lists Apni Mandi, Hadaspar Mandi, Rythu Bazars, and Uzhavar Sandies as examples of alternative marketing channels that allow farmers to sell directly to consumers, leading to a larger share of consumer prices (statement 1). The text also describes how fast-food chains are contracting with farmers to secure high-quality produce at predetermined prices, mitigating price risks for farmers (statement 2).  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect information presented in the passage.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements as presented in the source material.


**3. With reference to the challenges in India’s agricultural marketing, consider the following statements:**

1. Private trade, dominated by moneylenders, rural elites, large merchants, and wealthy farmers, handles over 90% of agricultural products, overshadowing government agencies and consumer cooperatives.
2.  The rapid commercialization of agriculture in the era of globalization presents significant opportunities for value addition through processing, requiring farmer training and awareness to enhance their marketing capabilities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that private trade handles 90% of agricultural products, significantly exceeding the share of government and cooperative agencies (statement 1). This directly supports the statement's claim. The passage also highlights the opportunities for value addition through processing in a globalized agricultural market, emphasizing the need for farmer training and awareness (statement 2), thus validating this statement. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements as presented in the provided text.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the sources of human capital formation in India:**

1. Investment in education is a primary source, mirroring corporate investment in capital goods to increase future profits; individuals invest in education similarly to enhance future income.
2. Health expenditure, encompassing preventive and curative medicine and improved sanitation, is a crucial source, as a healthy workforce is more productive than an unhealthy one.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly draws a parallel between individual investment in education and corporate investment in capital goods, both aimed at increasing future returns (statement 1), thus supporting the statement. The text also emphasizes the importance of health expenditure – including preventive and curative care, and sanitation – in boosting workforce productivity and thus contributing to human capital formation (statement 2).  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to recognize the validity of both statements, which are clearly supported by the source material.


**5. With reference to the factors affecting rice prices in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for agricultural products directly influence rice prices.
2. Government stockpiling and trading activities significantly impact the supply and, consequently, the price of rice.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text mentions that Minimum Support Prices (MSP) are a policy instrument aimed at protecting farmers' income, implying a direct influence on rice prices (statement 1).  The text also refers to government maintenance of buffer stocks of rice, showing that government stockpiling and trading directly affect rice supply and prices (statement 2).  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the explicit connection between MSP, government stockpiling, and rice prices as described in the text.


**6. With reference to the Indian dairy sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The success of ‘Operation Flood’ is attributed to a system where farmers pool their milk produce, graded by quality, processed, and marketed to urban centers through cooperatives.
2.  The Gujarat state model of efficient milk cooperative implementation has served as a successful example for other states to emulate.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly describes ‘Operation Flood’ as a system where farmers pool and grade their milk, which is then processed and marketed through cooperatives, explaining its success (statement 1). The text also explicitly cites Gujarat as a successful example of efficient milk cooperative implementation, emulated by other states (statement 2).  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they don't recognize the validity of both statements, which are directly supported by the provided text.


**7. With reference to the Indian fishing industry, consider the following statements:**

1. Inland sources contribute approximately half of India’s total fish production, with the marine sector (sea and oceans) contributing the remaining half.
2.  Kerala, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu are among the major producers of marine products in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that inland fish production contributes about 49% to the total, with the marine sector contributing the remaining 51% (statement 1).  The passage also names Kerala, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu as major marine product producers (statement 2).  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to account for the accuracy of both statements as presented in the provided text.  The slight discrepancy in percentages (49% vs 51%)  doesn't invalidate the overall accuracy of the statement within the context of the approximation used.


**8. With reference to India's horticultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India cultivates a diverse range of horticultural crops including fruits, vegetables, tuber crops, flowers, medicinal and aromatic plants, spices, and plantation crops.
2.  These crops play a vital role in providing food and nutrition security and addressing employment concerns in rural areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly lists the wide variety of horticultural crops grown in India (statement 1).  Furthermore, the text directly states that these crops are vital for food and nutrition, and also address employment concerns (statement 2).  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements as presented in the source material.


**9. Consider the following statements concerning the state of infrastructure in India:**

1.  India’s investment in infrastructure as a percentage of its GDP is significantly lower compared to countries like China and Indonesia.
2.  Access to improved sanitation in rural areas of India was very limited even by 1996, according to a National Sample Survey Organisation study.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly states that India invests only 5% of its GDP on infrastructure, contrasting this with higher percentages in countries such as China and Indonesia (statement 1). The text also mentions a National Sample Survey Organisation study indicating that access to improved sanitation in rural areas was only at 6% by 1996 (statement 2). Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect, failing to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements, which are directly supported by the provided text.


**10. With reference to the challenges of poverty in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Although the absolute number of poor people in India has decreased, the progress in poverty reduction has been slower compared to many other countries.
2.  The benefits of economic growth have not reached all sections of the population equally, resulting in persistent poverty among certain groups and regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage acknowledges a decrease in the absolute number of poor people but also points out that the pace of poverty reduction in India lags behind many other nations (statement 1).  It further highlights the uneven distribution of development benefits, leading to continued poverty in specific groups and regions (statement 2). Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the validity of both statements, which are clearly supported by the source material.  The nuanced nature of the statements, acknowledging both progress and persistent challenges, makes them accurate representations of the text's information.


**1. With reference to the Green Revolution in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The initial phase of the Green Revolution primarily benefited wheat-growing regions in affluent states like Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.
2. The second phase witnessed the expansion of HYV technology to more states and a wider range of crops, leading to food grain self-sufficiency.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that the first phase of the Green Revolution (mid-1960s to mid-1970s) focused on affluent states and wheat production.  This directly supports statement 1.  The text further highlights that the second phase (mid-1970s to mid-1980s) led to a broader geographical reach and crop diversification, ultimately achieving food grain self-sufficiency for India. This corroborates statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the phases and impact of the Green Revolution in India.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only partially represent the historical progression and impact of the Green Revolution. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually accurate based on the provided information.


**2. With reference to the marketed surplus in Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  A significant portion of the rice and wheat produced during the Green Revolution was sold in the market, leading to a decline in food grain prices relative to other goods.
2. The decline in relative food grain prices primarily benefited high-income groups who spend a smaller percentage of their income on food.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions that a substantial amount of rice and wheat produced during the Green Revolution entered the market as a marketed surplus. This led to a decrease in food grain prices compared to other consumer goods. This directly supports statement 1. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly indicates that the low-income groups, who spend a larger proportion of their income on food, were the primary beneficiaries of this price decline.  High-income groups would have experienced a relatively smaller impact.

By reducing post-harvest losses and improving market linkages, the mission aims to enhance the overall economic viability of bamboo cultivation and processing for farmers and entrepreneurs.  The mission's focus on non-forest areas and post-harvest management reflects a holistic approach to bamboo development.


**9. With reference to Genetically Modified (GM) crops in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) has approved the commercial cultivation of several GM food crops, including GM mustard.
2.  The government's regulation of Bt cotton seed prices has been challenged by industry players on grounds of violating free market principles.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the GEAC has recommended the environmental release of GM mustard (as of October 2022), it has not yet approved the commercial cultivation of several GM food crops.  In India, commercial cultivation is largely limited to Bt cotton.  The approval process for GM crops is stringent and involves multiple stages of assessment and public consultation. Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian government's intervention to regulate the prices of Bt cotton seeds, including royalty fees, has faced significant opposition from industry players.  These companies argue that price controls violate the principles of a free market and may discourage investment in research and development of new seed technologies.  The conflict between government regulation and industry interests highlights the complexities of managing intellectual property rights and ensuring fair prices for farmers in the context of GM technology.  The debate reflects broader concerns about the balance between innovation, market dynamics, and farmer welfare.


**10. With reference to vertical and horizontal integration in business, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tata Power acquiring a coal mine would be an example of forward integration, as it expands its control over the supply chain.
2.  Tata Power acquiring another power generation company would be an example of horizontal integration, aimed at increasing market share.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Acquiring a coal mine by Tata Power would be an example of *backward* integration, not forward integration.  Backward integration involves gaining control over the supply of inputs or raw materials.  In this case, Tata Power is securing a source of coal, a key input in its power generation process. Forward integration, on the other hand, would involve expanding control over distribution or downstream activities. Statement 2 is correct.  Acquiring another power generation company represents horizontal integration.  Horizontal integration involves merging or acquiring companies operating in the same industry or at the same stage of the production process.  The goal is usually to increase market share, expand product offerings, or achieve economies of scale by consolidating operations.  Therefore, Tata Power's acquisition of a similar power generation company is a classic example of horizontal integration strategy.  Understanding the difference between vertical and horizontal integration is crucial for analyzing business strategies and their implications.

**1. With reference to India's environmental challenges, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's high population and livestock density, relative to its geographical area, exert immense pressure on land resources, leading to competing uses for forestry, agriculture, and human settlements.
2.  The per capita forestland in India significantly exceeds the required amount to meet basic needs, resulting in a sustainable extraction of forest resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India faces a significant challenge due to its high population and livestock density concentrated on a relatively small land area. This creates intense competition for land use, impacting forestry, agriculture, and human settlements.  The text explicitly mentions this pressure on finite land resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the per capita forestland in India is *less* than the required amount to meet basic needs, leading to excessive felling of forests.  This directly contradicts statement 2. The claim of sustainable extraction is factually inaccurate based on the provided information.  The text highlights the unsustainable nature of forest resource usage.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India's environmental resource management:**

1.  The demand for environmental resources has historically outpaced their regeneration rate, leading to increased pressure on the environment's absorptive capacity.  This trend continues today.
2.  The supply of environmental resources is currently abundant, exceeding the demand due to effective conservation measures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the text's description of India's environmental situation. The text emphasizes a historical imbalance where the demand for resources consistently surpasses the rate of their natural replenishment. This leads to strain on the environment's ability to absorb waste and pollution.  The continuation of this trend is explicitly stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage directly contradicts this statement.  It highlights that the supply of environmental resources is *limited* due to overuse and misuse, not abundant.  Effective conservation is mentioned as a *needed* improvement, not as a current reality.


**3. With reference to land degradation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Unsustainable fuelwood and fodder extraction is a significant contributor to land degradation, alongside deforestation and improper irrigation management.
2.  The primary cause of land degradation in India stems from the abundance of fertile land and the over-application of agro-chemicals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies several key factors contributing to land degradation in India. The text lists unsustainable fuelwood and fodder extraction, along with deforestation and improper irrigation management, as major causes of land degradation. These are explicitly mentioned as contributing factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the over-application of agro-chemicals is a problem, the text does not identify it as the *primary* cause.  The text emphasizes unsustainable practices, deforestation, and improper management as the main drivers of land degradation.  The statement presents a misleading and overly simplistic view of a complex problem. The abundance of fertile land is not presented as a cause of degradation.


**4. With reference to India’s environmental policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), established in 1974, primarily focuses on addressing water pollution issues, leaving air pollution to state-level agencies.
2. Pollution control boards in India conduct research, collect data on pollution levels, and implement standards for emissions and effluents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CPCB was established to address major environmental concerns, including both water and air pollution,  the text describes its role as encompassing both areas. The statement wrongly restricts its function to only water pollution. State-level boards also play a role but CPCB has an overarching role.

Statement 2 accurately describes a key function of pollution control boards in India. The passage explicitly mentions their involvement in investigation, data collection, standard setting for emissions and effluents, research, and technical assistance.

However, it also emphasizes a recent revival of interest in these systems, particularly for chronic health problems. The statement presents an oversimplified and outdated view.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the growing popularity of herbal products in various industries, highlighting the return to environmentally friendly traditional practices. This clearly supports the statement.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning sustainable development in India:**

1.  The concept of sustainable development prioritizes economic growth above environmental considerations.
2.  Sustainable development aims to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly presents sustainable development as a paradigm shift that aims to *minimize* environmental problems while promoting economic development. It's not a prioritization of one over the other. The statement misrepresents the core principle.

Statement 2 correctly defines a central tenet of sustainable development.  The text directly quotes the definition of sustainable development as meeting present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their own.


**7. With reference to India's agricultural sector and the goal of doubling farmers' income, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agriculture Export Policy 2018 aims to increase agricultural exports to $60 billion by 2022 and $100 billion subsequently, primarily focusing on high-value crops.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states the Agriculture Export Policy 2018's objectives, including the export targets and emphasis on high-value and value-added products.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text identifies improving livestock productivity, increasing cropping intensity, resource use efficiency, diversification, and better terms of trade as crucial strategies for achieving the goal of doubling farmers' income.  These are all presented as key components of the strategy.


**8. With reference to agricultural marketing in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The private sector dominates agricultural markets in India, handling the vast majority of agricultural products.
2.  The establishment of alternative marketing channels like Apni Mandi and Rythu Bazars aims to reduce farmers' reliance on government agencies for marketing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that private trade dominates agricultural markets in India, with government agencies and cooperatives handling only a small percentage of agricultural products.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text mentions alternative marketing channels like Apni Mandi and Rythu Bazars as mechanisms designed to allow farmers to sell directly to consumers, thereby reducing dependence on intermediaries and government agencies.  This aligns directly with the statement.


**9.  With reference to India's infrastructure and development, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP is significantly higher than that of most developed nations, driving rapid economic growth.
2.  Adequate infrastructure, including irrigation, transportation, and communication, is crucial for the efficient functioning of both modern agriculture and industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text indicates that India's infrastructure investment as a percentage of GDP is *lower* than that of many other countries, including China and Indonesia.  The statement misrepresents the data.  The claim of rapid economic growth solely due to this is unsupported.

Statement 2 is correct. The text strongly emphasizes the vital role of infrastructure in supporting both agricultural and industrial productivity.  It highlights the dependence of various sectors on infrastructure components like irrigation, transportation, and communication.


**10. With reference to employment in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The primary sector (agriculture and mining) remains the dominant source of employment in India, employing a large majority of the workforce.
2.  The trend of casualization of the workforce in India has led to a decrease in the proportion of casual laborers and an increase in the number of regular salaried employees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text consistently highlights the dominance of the primary sector (agriculture and related activities) as the largest employer in India, providing jobs to a significant majority of the workforce.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly describes an *increase* in the proportion of casual laborers in India, a process referred to as casualization.  This directly contradicts the statement's assertion of a decrease.  The text highlights the vulnerability created by this increasing casualization.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions may focus more on economic development and related policy than strictly polity and governance. However, the questions are framed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter, aligning with UPSC expectations.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Green Revolution in India significantly increased food grain production but also exacerbated regional disparities.
2.  The construction of the Indira Gandhi Canal, initiated in 1958, originated from the Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Green Revolution did lead to a substantial increase in food grain production, primarily through the adoption of high-yielding variety seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation. However, this progress was not evenly distributed, leading to a widening gap between different regions.  Some areas benefited disproportionately, while others lagged behind, exacerbating existing inequalities.  This uneven distribution of benefits is a well-documented aspect of the Green Revolution's impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indira Gandhi Canal originates from the Harike Barrage on the Sutlej River, not the Bhakra Dam. While both are significant irrigation projects in the same region,  confusing the origin point demonstrates a lack of precise knowledge about the canal's infrastructure. The Harike Barrage, located at the confluence of the Sutlej and Beas rivers in Punjab, is the actual starting point of the Indira Gandhi Canal.


**2. With reference to agricultural subsidies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Subsidies are provided to farmers on both inputs (fertilizers, seeds, etc.) and outputs (MSP, logistics).
2.  Small and marginal farmers typically receive a large proportion of these agricultural subsidies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The Indian government offers a range of subsidies to the agricultural sector.  Input subsidies aim to reduce the cost of essential farming inputs, while output subsidies like the Minimum Support Price (MSP) are intended to guarantee minimum prices for certain crops.  Logistics subsidies also play a part in supporting agricultural marketing and transportation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the intention of subsidies is often to benefit small and marginal farmers, in practice, a disproportionate share often reaches larger farmers due to various factors including access to information, resources, and efficient bureaucratic processes.  The delivery mechanisms for subsidies have been criticized for their inefficiencies and leakages, leading to a less-than-ideal reach for the intended beneficiaries.


**3. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MSP is legally binding on private players, mandating procurement at the announced price.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) is a statutory body responsible for setting the MSP.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MSP, while a crucial policy instrument, lacks legal backing.  It's an administrative decision by the government, not a legally enforceable obligation on private players.  Private traders are free to negotiate prices in the market, irrespective of the announced MSP. The government's procurement operations, while significant, do not cover the entire production.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The CACP, while recommending MSPs, is not a statutory body. It's an advisory body attached to the Ministry of Agriculture.  The final decision on MSP fixation and implementation rests with the government.  The lack of statutory status for the CACP highlights the policy's flexible nature and its susceptibility to political and economic considerations.


**4. Consider the following statements about human capital formation in India:**

1.  Investment in education is the sole primary source of human capital formation.
2.  Migration, though involving costs, contributes to human capital formation due to enhanced earnings.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While education is a crucial element, human capital formation encompasses a broader range of investments.  It includes health, on-the-job training, and even migration (as people move to areas with better job prospects).  The multifaceted nature of human capital necessitates a holistic approach to its development.

Statement 2 is correct.  Migration, although involving costs like relocation and adjustment, can contribute to human capital formation if the individual's enhanced earnings in the new location outweigh these costs.  This increase in earning potential represents a tangible return on the investment made in migration.  The enhanced productivity resulting from better opportunities contributes to the overall human capital stock.


**5. With reference to India's environmental concerns, consider the following statements:**

1.  India possesses abundant natural resources, but developmental activities have created significant environmental pressures.
2.  Land degradation in India is primarily caused by factors unrelated to unsustainable agricultural practices.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India is rich in natural resources like fertile soil, rivers, forests, and mineral deposits. However, rapid industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural intensification have placed immense pressure on these resources, leading to various environmental challenges.  The tension between economic development and environmental protection is a recurring theme in India's policy debates.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Unsustainable agricultural practices are a major contributor to land degradation in India.  Factors like deforestation, unsustainable fuelwood and fodder extraction, shifting cultivation, and improper irrigation management significantly contribute to soil erosion and loss of fertility.  Ignoring these agricultural factors in assessing land degradation would present an incomplete and inaccurate picture.


**6. With reference to the Indian dairy cooperative movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement has achieved widespread success, transforming the socio-economic landscape in many regions.
2.  The movement has consistently shown resilience, with no setbacks encountered in recent years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian dairy cooperative movement, notably exemplified by Amul in Gujarat, has been remarkably successful in improving milk production, farmer incomes, and consumer access to quality dairy products.  This success is often cited as a model for rural development and cooperative enterprise.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the movement has achieved significant success, it has also faced challenges in recent years. Issues like inadequate coverage of farmer members, weak links between marketing and processing cooperatives, and inefficient financial management have created setbacks for the movement.  The challenges highlight the need for continuous improvement and adaptation in cooperative structures and governance.


**7. With reference to India's foreign trade during the colonial period, consider the following statements:**

1.  India primarily exported finished manufactured goods and imported raw materials.
2.  A large export surplus was generated, resulting in a significant inflow of gold and silver into India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. During the colonial era, India's foreign trade was characterized by the export of raw materials (like cotton, jute, indigo) and the import of finished manufactured goods from Britain. This pattern reflected the colonial economic policy that aimed to exploit India's resources for the benefit of the British industries.  The imbalance in trade, favoring Britain, is a key feature of the colonial economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While a large export surplus was indeed generated, this did not translate into a significant inflow of gold or silver. Instead, the surplus was used to offset the "drain of wealth" from India, covering expenses incurred by the British government in India and Britain, as well as the cost of invisible imports (services, etc.).  The export surplus masked the underlying economic exploitation.


**8.  Consider the following statements about the Indian economy during the reform period:**

1.  The growth of the agricultural sector has consistently increased during the reform period.
2.  Foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign exchange reserves have significantly increased during the reform period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indian economy experienced overall growth during the reform period, the agricultural sector's growth rate has been inconsistent and faced challenges, including reduced public investment and increased international competition.  The sector's performance hasn't shown consistent upward trends.

Statement 2 is correct.  The liberalization policies of the 1990s led to a significant increase in both FDI inflows and foreign exchange reserves. This influx of foreign capital played a role in supporting economic growth and boosting India's global economic standing.  The increase in reserves also contributed to greater macroeconomic stability.


**9. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme aims to provide loans to poor farmers for cultivating specific crops.
2.  The scheme's primary goal is to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) focuses on providing financial assistance to micro and small entrepreneurs, not specifically to farmers for crop cultivation.  The scheme aims to address the credit needs of a broader segment of the economy.

Statement 2 is correct.  A core objective of MUDRA is to facilitate access to formal credit for small entrepreneurs who often rely on informal and expensive sources of finance.  By bringing them into the formal financial system, the scheme aims to foster growth and development of the MSME sector.  Improved access to credit enhances their business prospects.


**10. With reference to  India's financial sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is involved in promoting financial inclusion.
2.  RuPay is a card payment scheme launched by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  NPCI plays a significant role in promoting financial inclusion through its various initiatives, including the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and other digital payment systems.  These technologies have broadened access to financial services, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. RuPay is a card payment scheme launched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), not the RBI.  While the RBI regulates the financial system, NPCI is the implementing agency for RuPay. This distinction highlights the different roles of regulatory bodies and operational entities in the financial sector.


**11. With reference to Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SFBs primarily aim to supply credit to large corporations and industrial houses.
2.  SFBs are specifically designed to encourage young entrepreneurs, particularly in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  SFBs are designed to cater to the credit needs of small businesses, small and marginal farmers, and underserved segments of the population. Their focus is explicitly on providing financial services to those typically excluded from or inadequately served by mainstream banks.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  While SFBs aim to serve rural areas and promote financial inclusion, their focus is not exclusively on young entrepreneurs. They encompass a broader range of clients within the small business and agricultural sectors.  The encouragement of entrepreneurship is an indirect benefit of improved financial access.


**12. Consider the following statements about the "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR):**

1. The MDR is an incentive given by the government to merchants for promoting digital payments.
2. The MDR is a charge levied by banks on merchants for accepting payments through debit cards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MDR is not a government incentive; it is a fee. The government may offer incentives to *promote* digital payments, but the MDR itself is a transaction fee.  Confusing the two concepts displays a misunderstanding of the economic mechanism.

Statement 2 is correct. The MDR is a fee charged by banks to merchants for processing debit card payments. This fee covers the costs associated with the transaction processing, including network fees and other related expenses. The MDR is a significant factor impacting the adoption of digital payment systems by merchants.


**13. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1. Legal tender money refers to metallic money in circulation within a country.
2. A creditor is legally obligated to accept legal tender money in settlement of claims.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Legal tender money is not limited to metallic currency. It encompasses any form of currency that a creditor is legally compelled to accept in payment of debts.  This definition includes both physical currency and digital forms of money issued by the central bank.

Statement 2 is correct. The defining characteristic of legal tender is that a creditor must accept it as payment. This legal compulsion ensures that the currency functions smoothly as a medium of exchange.  The enforceability of legal tender is crucial for maintaining the stability of the monetary system.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The RBI manages and services both central and state government securities.
2. The RBI's power and authority are solely derived from the RBI Act, not the Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI manages and services Central Government Securities but not State Government Securities. This division of responsibilities reflects the federal structure of the Indian government. The management of state government securities falls under the purview of state-level entities.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The RBI's primary source of power and authority is the RBI Act. However, the Constitution of India also plays a role, granting the central government the power to issue directions to the RBI in the public interest.  This constitutional provision provides an oversight mechanism for the government.


**15. Consider the following statements about Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):**

1.  CAR is the amount banks maintain to offset losses from non-repayment of dues by account holders.
2.  The CAR is determined by each individual bank, based on its internal risk assessment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  CAR is a crucial regulatory requirement for banks, representing the minimum amount of capital they must hold as a percentage of their risk-weighted assets.  This capital acts as a buffer to absorb potential losses, including those arising from non-performing assets (NPAs) where borrowers fail to repay their loans.  Maintaining an adequate CAR is essential for the stability of the banking system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAR is not decided by individual banks. It's a regulatory requirement set by the RBI, based on international standards (Basel norms).  While banks must undertake their own internal risk assessments, the minimum CAR is dictated by the regulator to ensure uniform standards across the banking sector.


**16. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deposits are considered assets of a commercial bank.
2.  Advances (loans) are not considered assets of a commercial bank.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Deposits are liabilities, not assets, for a commercial bank.  They represent obligations to depositors, not resources owned by the bank.  This fundamental accounting principle is crucial for understanding a bank's balance sheet.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Advances (loans) are a significant component of a commercial bank's assets. They represent funds lent out by the bank, generating interest income.  The advances reflect the bank's lending activities and are a key element of its profitability.


**17. With reference to factors contributing to reducing the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Increasing government expenditure is a significant factor in mitigating currency crisis risk.
2. Remittances from Indians abroad contribute to reducing the risk of a currency crisis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Increasing government expenditure, particularly if it's not matched by corresponding revenue increases, can actually *increase* the risk of a currency crisis.  Excessive government spending can lead to higher inflation and a widening current account deficit, making the currency vulnerable to speculative attacks.

Statement 2 is correct.  Remittances from Indians working abroad provide a significant inflow of foreign currency, bolstering the country's foreign exchange reserves and improving its balance of payments.  This enhanced supply of foreign currency helps to stabilize the exchange rate and reduces the vulnerability to currency crises.


**18. Consider the following statements about measures taken to stop the slide of the Indian rupee:**

1. Easing conditions relating to external commercial borrowing can help prevent a rupee slide.
2. Following an expansionary monetary policy is an effective measure to stop a rupee slide.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Easing conditions for external commercial borrowing (ECB) can actually *exacerbate* a rupee slide. Increased inflow of foreign currency through ECBs might initially support the rupee but, if not managed carefully, could lead to increased demand for imports and potentially worsen the current account deficit, ultimately destabilizing the currency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Expansionary monetary policy, which involves increasing the money supply, can fuel inflation and weaken the currency. In a scenario of rupee depreciation, contractionary monetary policy (reducing the money supply) is more likely to be employed to control inflation and support the currency value.  The choice of monetary policy depends on the specific economic conditions.


**19. With reference to the money multiplier, consider the following statements:**

1.  The money multiplier decreases with an increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR).
2.  An increase in the population of a country automatically increases the money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The money multiplier is inversely related to the CRR. A higher CRR means banks are required to keep a larger proportion of their deposits as reserves, reducing the amount available for lending, thus lowering the money multiplier.  The CRR is a key tool used by central banks to control money supply.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Population growth alone doesn't directly affect the money multiplier. The multiplier depends on factors like the CRR, the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), and the public's preference for holding cash versus bank deposits.  Population growth might indirectly influence these factors but doesn't have a direct relationship with the money multiplier.


**20. Consider the following statements about actions that could provide immunity to India during a global financial crisis:**

1.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility is essential for immunity during a global financial crisis.
2.  Reducing dependence on short-term foreign borrowings is a crucial measure to mitigate the impact of a global financial crisis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While capital account convertibility offers certain benefits, full convertibility can also increase vulnerability during a global financial crisis.  Unfettered capital flows can lead to rapid capital flight if investor confidence diminishes.  Controlled capital account management can provide a buffer during times of crisis.

Statement 2 is correct.  A high reliance on short-term foreign borrowings increases a country's vulnerability to a global financial crisis.  Short-term debt needs to be rolled over frequently, and if global liquidity dries up, it becomes difficult to refinance these debts, exposing the country to a potential crisis.  Reducing dependence on short-term debt enhances resilience.


**21. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  KCC provides credit support for the construction of family houses.
2.  KCC provides credit support for post-harvest expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  KCC primarily focuses on providing credit for agricultural activities and related expenses.  While the scheme aims to improve the financial well-being of farmers, it doesn't typically cover non-agricultural expenses like house construction.

Statement 2 is correct.  KCC credit support extends to post-harvest expenses, which are an integral part of the farming cycle.  These expenses include storage, processing, and transportation of agricultural produce.  Access to credit for this phase is crucial for farmers to maximize their returns.


**22. Consider the following statements regarding financial instruments:**

1.  A Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a long-term instrument issued by the RBI to corporations.
2.  Call money is a short-term financial instrument used for interbank transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CDs are short-term borrowings issued by banks (and other financial institutions), not the RBI, to corporations.  The statement incorrectly identifies both the issuer and the term of the instrument.

Statement 2 is correct. Call money is a very short-term borrowing instrument used mainly by banks for managing their short-term liquidity.  It's a crucial part of the interbank money market, facilitating the transfer of funds between banks.  The short-term nature is essential for its function in liquidity management.


**23. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FDI is primarily characterized as investment involving debt servicing.
2.  FDI is considered a largely non-debt-creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FDI is typically equity investment, not debt.  While FDI might lead to subsequent debt financing by the recipient company, the initial investment itself doesn't represent a debt obligation.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the nature of capital flows.

Statement 2 is correct.  FDI is fundamentally an equity investment, not a debt instrument.  This means it doesn't create a debt servicing obligation for the recipient country.  The non-debt nature of FDI makes it a relatively stable source of long-term capital.


**24. Consider the following statements about the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The Central Government appoints the Governor of the RBI.
2. The RBI Governor's authority is derived solely from the RBI Act, without any constitutional basis.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Central Government of India appoints the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. This reflects the government's ultimate authority over the central bank, although the RBI operates with a degree of operational independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI Act is the primary legal basis for the RBI's functioning, the Constitution of India also grants the Central Government certain powers to issue directions to the RBI in the public interest. This constitutional provision ensures governmental oversight and accountability.


**25. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  UCBs are supervised and regulated by local boards set up by the State Governments.
2.  UCBs are permitted to issue both equity shares and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While state governments have a role in overseeing the cooperative sector, the regulation and supervision of UCBs are primarily carried out by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not local boards set up by state governments.  The RBI's role reflects the importance of maintaining consistent standards across the banking sector.

Statement 2 is correct.  UCBs are permitted to raise capital through the issuance of both equity shares and preference shares. This capital structure allows them to diversify their funding sources and strengthen their financial position.  The ability to issue different share types is a common feature of cooperative banks.


**26. Consider the following statements about factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields:**

1. Actions of the United States Federal Reserve have no impact on Indian Government Bond Yields.
2. Inflation and short-term interest rates significantly influence Indian Government Bond Yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Global factors, including the actions of the US Federal Reserve (the Fed), can significantly influence Indian Government Bond Yields.  Changes in US monetary policy affect global liquidity and interest rates, which, in turn, can impact investor demand for Indian government bonds.  The interconnectedness of global financial markets means that events in one country can have ripple effects elsewhere.

Statement 2 is correct.  Inflation and short-term interest rates are major determinants of government bond yields.  Higher inflation generally leads to higher yields as investors demand a higher return to compensate for the erosion of purchasing power.  Similarly, rising short-term interest rates put upward pressure on bond yields as investors seek higher returns in the short-term market.


**27. With reference to foreign direct investment (FDI), consider the following:**

1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds are a form of FDI.
2.  Non-resident external deposits are considered a form of FDI.

Which of the above can be included in Foreign Direct Investments?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) are a form of external commercial borrowing (ECB), not FDI.  FCCBs are debt instruments that can be converted into equity under certain conditions.  This debt-based nature distinguishes them from FDI, which primarily involves equity investment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Non-resident external (NRE) deposits are simply deposits held by non-resident Indians in Indian banks.  These deposits are not considered FDI as they do not represent direct investment in productive assets within the country.  NRE deposits are essentially short-term investments, not long-term capital inflows.


**28. Consider the following statements regarding the effects of currency devaluation:**

1.  Currency devaluation necessarily improves the trade balance.
2.  Currency devaluation necessarily increases the foreign value of domestic currency.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While devaluation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, its effect on the trade balance is not guaranteed.  The response of exports and imports to price changes is complex and depends on various factors like price elasticity of demand, and the availability of substitutes.  Devaluation might not lead to an immediate improvement in the trade balance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Devaluation, by definition, *decreases* the value of the domestic currency in terms of foreign currencies.  The statement incorrectly suggests an increase in the foreign value.  The very purpose of devaluation is to make the domestic currency cheaper relative to other currencies.


**29. With reference to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following:**

1. Rising interest rates contribute to demand-pull inflation.
2. Expansionary fiscal policies can increase demand-pull inflation.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rising interest rates are typically used to *combat* demand-pull inflation, not cause it.  Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, reducing aggregate demand and thus cooling down inflationary pressures.  The use of interest rates as a monetary policy tool is a core element of macroeconomic management.

Statement 2 is correct. Expansionary fiscal policies, which involve increased government spending or tax cuts, can fuel demand-pull inflation.  The increased spending power in the economy boosts aggregate demand, which, if it exceeds the productive capacity of the economy, leads to rising prices.  The relationship between fiscal policy and inflation is a central concept in macroeconomics.



Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided text, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects implied within the economic and agricultural data.

This signifies a failure in achieving equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, a crucial component of economic development.  Even if the overall economy is growing (as reflected in GNP), the persistence of widespread poverty and unemployment demonstrates a lack of inclusive growth and thus, limited economic development.  The presence of these social ills undermines the quality of life and overall progress, despite numerical growth in GNP.


**2. With reference to capital formation and economic output, consider the following statements:**

1.  High savings rates in an economy guarantee significant increases in output.
2.  A high capital-output ratio can limit the impact of capital formation on output growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. High savings rates are a necessary but not sufficient condition for significant output increases.  The efficiency of capital utilization and allocation plays a crucial role.  Even with high savings, if the capital is not invested productively (due to factors like poor infrastructure, lack of technology, or inefficient institutions), the resulting increase in output might be minimal.  Furthermore, the composition of savings and investment matters; savings channeled into unproductive ventures will not translate into significant output growth.

Statement 2 is correct. The capital-output ratio (COR) measures the amount of capital required to produce one unit of output. A high COR indicates that a large amount of capital investment is needed to generate a small increase in output. This can be due to various factors, including technological inefficiencies, lack of skilled labor, or inadequate infrastructure.  In such cases, even substantial capital formation might not lead to a proportionally large increase in output, limiting the impact on economic growth.


**3. With reference to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1.  PPP exchange rates are determined by comparing the prices of a standardized basket of goods and services across different countries.
2.  In terms of PPP, India consistently ranks among the top five largest economies globally.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of an identical basket of goods and services in different countries. The aim is to adjust for differences in the price levels of goods and services across countries, allowing for a more accurate comparison of national incomes and economic sizes.  This helps to overcome the limitations of using nominal exchange rates, which can be significantly influenced by short-term market fluctuations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's economy is substantial,  its ranking in terms of PPP is not consistently among the top five largest economies globally.  The ranking fluctuates depending on the methodology and data used. While India's PPP-adjusted GDP is significantly higher than its nominal GDP,  it still typically falls outside the top five largest economies when considering PPP-adjusted figures.  The actual ranking varies across different organizations' estimations.


**4. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPI gives greater weight to food items compared to the WPI.
2.  The WPI captures changes in service sector prices, unlike the CPI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CPI (Consumer Price Index) typically assigns a higher weight to food items than the WPI (Wholesale Price Index). This is because a larger proportion of household expenditure in many developing economies, including India, is allocated to food.  The CPI aims to reflect the cost of living for consumers, so it reflects the relative importance of different goods and services in household budgets. Food items constitute a major component of the consumer basket.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WPI primarily focuses on the price changes of goods at the wholesale level, and it generally does not capture the price changes in the services sector. The CPI, on the other hand, includes services along with goods, giving a broader picture of inflation affecting consumers.  Therefore, the statement accurately describes the difference in the scope of these two indices.


**5. With reference to market demand for a good, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the price of a substitute good will increase the demand for the good in question.
2.  An increase in the price of a complementary good will increase the demand for the good in question.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of each other to satisfy the same consumer need. If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will likely switch to the relatively cheaper alternative (the good in question), leading to an increase in its demand.  This is a fundamental principle of consumer behavior in response to price changes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Complementary goods are those that are consumed together. If the price of a complementary good increases, the demand for the other good (the good in question) will typically decrease.  This is because the increased price of the complement reduces the overall desirability and affordability of the combined consumption.  The two goods are jointly demanded, so a price increase in one negatively impacts the demand for the other.


**6. With reference to exchange rates in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) signifies an appreciation of the Rupee.
2.  An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates improved trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates a *depreciation* of the Rupee, not an appreciation. NEER is an index that measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies. An increase means the Rupee has weakened relative to the basket of currencies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates a *reduction* in trade competitiveness. REER is adjusted for inflation, providing a more accurate reflection of a currency's purchasing power and competitiveness. An increase in REER suggests that domestic goods and services have become relatively more expensive compared to those of other countries, making them less competitive in international markets.


**7. With reference to the impact of government spending on the economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Increased government expenditure always leads to a proportionate increase in employment.
2.  Government employment generation programs can indirectly boost employment in other sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Increased government expenditure does not guarantee a proportionate increase in employment. The impact on employment depends on several factors, including the nature of the expenditure (e.g., infrastructure projects vs. social welfare programs), the efficiency of implementation, and the overall economic climate.  Government spending can be inefficient or leak out of the economy, resulting in minimal employment creation.

Statement 2 is correct. Government employment generation programs often have a multiplier effect on the economy.  For instance, a government project creating jobs in a particular sector (e.g., construction) will also generate demand for inputs from other sectors, leading to increased employment in those sectors. This indirect employment generation is a significant aspect of the economic impact of government spending.


**8. With reference to the Indian workforce, consider the following statements:**

1.  The service sector is the primary source of newly emerging jobs in India.
2.  Outsourcing has universally benefited individual workers in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The service sector has emerged as the dominant driver of job creation in India, especially in recent decades.  This is due to factors like the growth of IT, business process outsourcing (BPO), and other service-based industries.  While other sectors contribute to employment, the service sector's expansion has been particularly significant in generating new employment opportunities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Outsourcing, while contributing to economic growth, has not universally benefited individual workers in India. While it has created some jobs, many of these are in the informal sector with limited job security, social security benefits, and often lower wages compared to formal sector employment. The impact of outsourcing on individual workers is complex and varied, with both positive and negative consequences.


**9. With reference to the characteristics of money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money must be easily and freely available in large quantities to facilitate transactions.
2.  The evolution of paper currency eliminated the need for assets backing the currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  For money to function effectively as a medium of exchange, its supply should be relatively scarce and controlled.  If money were easily and freely available in large quantities, it would lose its value, leading to hyperinflation and rendering it useless as a store of value and unit of account.  The limited supply of money maintains its purchasing power.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the introduction of paper currency reduced the reliance on precious metals,  it did not eliminate the need for assets backing the currency altogether.  Central banks typically hold reserves of assets (e.g., government securities, foreign exchange) to support the value of the paper currency and maintain monetary stability.  The value of paper money is ultimately linked to the underlying assets and the credibility of the issuing authority.


**10. With reference to the functions of money in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1. Money serves primarily as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions.
2. Money's role as a store of value is absolute and unchanging over time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The primary function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange, simplifying transactions and eliminating the need for barter.  It allows for specialization and efficient allocation of resources by facilitating trade and commerce.  This is a fundamental characteristic of money in any economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While money serves as a store of value, its effectiveness in this role is not absolute and can change over time.  Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, reducing its value over time.  The stability of a currency's value as a store of value depends on factors like the government's monetary policy and overall economic stability.  Other assets may also serve as stores of value, sometimes offering better returns or protection against inflation.


**11. With reference to Seigniorage, consider the following statements:**

1. Seigniorage is a revenue stream for governments without direct taxation.
2. Seigniorage includes only the profit from the physical printing of currency notes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Seigniorage refers to the profit a government or central bank earns from issuing currency.  It's a way to generate revenue without imposing explicit taxes. This profit comes from the difference between the face value of the currency issued and the cost of producing it.  It's a form of implicit taxation, as the increased money supply can contribute to inflation, reducing the real value of existing currency held by the public.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Seigniorage encompasses more than just the profit from the physical printing of currency. It also includes the interest income earned on the reserves held by the central bank, the interest from bank balances held with the central bank to meet reserve requirements, and the revenue generated from the inflation tax (the loss in value of currency due to inflation).  The profit arises from multiple avenues related to money creation and management, not solely from printing costs.


**12. With reference to Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMMY primarily aims at providing loans to farmers for specific crop cultivation.
2. PMMY aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMMY indirectly benefits farmers through supporting small businesses involved in agriculture, its primary focus is not on providing loans directly to farmers for crop cultivation.  Other schemes specifically target agricultural credit needs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) is a government initiative aimed at providing funding to micro and small enterprises (MSEs). A key objective is to facilitate their access to formal financial services, enabling them to grow and contribute more effectively to the economy. By providing credit to these businesses, PMMY aims to promote entrepreneurship and financial inclusion.


**13. With reference to the Government’s Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  These schemes primarily aim to promote Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector.
2.  These schemes aim to reduce India's dependence on gold imports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While these schemes might indirectly attract some foreign investment, their primary goal is not to promote FDI in the gold and jewelry sector.  The focus is on mobilizing domestic gold resources.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme are designed to bring idle gold held by households and institutions into the financial system. By reducing reliance on imported gold, these schemes aim to lower India's dependence on gold imports, improving the country's balance of payments and reducing pressure on foreign exchange reserves.


**14. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NPCI's primary function is to regulate the banking sector in India.
2.  The NPCI has launched the RuPay card payment scheme.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is not responsible for regulating the banking sector. That function is primarily undertaken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The NPCI's role is to operate retail payment systems in India, promoting efficiency and innovation in payment infrastructure.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NPCI is the entity that launched the RuPay card payment scheme, offering an indigenous alternative to international card networks.  This initiative is aimed at promoting financial inclusion and reducing reliance on foreign payment systems.


**15. With reference to the purpose of Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SFBs primarily focus on providing credit to large corporations.
2.  SFBs aim to encourage young entrepreneurs to start businesses, particularly in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Small Finance Banks (SFBs) are designed to cater to the financial needs of underserved segments of the population, including micro and small businesses, farmers, and low-income households.  They do not primarily focus on providing credit to large corporations, which is handled by other types of banks.

Statement 2 is correct.  One of the objectives of establishing SFBs is to promote financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, particularly in rural areas.  By providing easier access to credit and financial services, SFBs aim to encourage young entrepreneurs to start and expand their businesses, contributing to economic growth and employment generation in rural regions.


**16. With reference to the term "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1. MDR is an incentive given by the government to merchants for promoting digital payments.
2. MDR is a charge levied on merchants by banks for accepting payments through debit cards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is not an incentive provided by the government.  It is a fee charged by banks to merchants for processing card payments.  While the government might incentivize digital payments through other schemes, MDR itself is a cost borne by merchants.

Statement 2 is correct.  The MDR is the fee that a merchant pays to the bank (and the acquiring network) for accepting card payments from customers.  This fee covers the costs associated with processing the transaction, including the bank's fees, network fees, and other related charges.


**17. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1. Legal tender money refers to the money used to pay legal fees in court.
2. Legal tender money is the currency that creditors are legally obligated to accept for settling debts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Legal tender money is not specifically defined as money used for paying legal fees.  While it can be used for this purpose, the definition is broader.

Statement 2 is correct. Legal tender money is the currency that a creditor is legally compelled to accept as payment for a debt.  This is a crucial aspect of a country's monetary system, ensuring that the designated currency is universally accepted for transactions and debt settlement.  This legal backing is essential for maintaining the currency's value and facilitating smooth economic functioning.


**18. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) functions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI manages and services only Central Government Securities.
2.  Treasury bills are issued only by the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) manages and services both Central and State Government Securities.  It plays a crucial role in the government borrowing process, acting as an intermediary between the government and the market for government securities.

Statement 2 is correct.  While the Central Government is the primary issuer of treasury bills, State Governments do not typically issue treasury bills.  Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments used for financing government expenditure.


**19. With reference to the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), consider the following statements:**

1. CAR is the amount banks maintain to offset losses if borrowers default on loans.
2. Each individual bank determines its own CAR.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a regulatory requirement for banks to maintain a certain level of capital relative to their risk-weighted assets. This capital acts as a buffer to absorb potential losses arising from loan defaults or other financial risks.  It ensures the financial stability of banks and protects depositors' interests.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAR is not decided by each individual bank.  It's a regulatory minimum set by the central bank (in India, the RBI) based on international standards (like Basel norms) and domestic considerations.  Banks must meet or exceed this minimum CAR to maintain their operational licenses.


**20. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Deposits are considered an asset for a commercial bank.
2. Investments in government securities are not considered assets for a commercial bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Deposits are considered a *liability*, not an asset, for a commercial bank.  Deposits represent the money the bank owes to its depositors.  Assets are what the bank owns, such as loans, investments, and cash.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Investments in government securities are considered *assets* for a commercial bank.  These investments provide a return and form part of the bank's portfolio.


**21. With reference to factors reducing the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Increasing government expenditure reduces the risk of a currency crisis.
2. Remittances from Indians abroad contribute to reducing the risk of a currency crisis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Increasing government expenditure, particularly if it's not financed prudently, can actually increase the risk of a currency crisis.  Large fiscal deficits can put pressure on the currency and lead to a loss of confidence in the economy.

Statement 2 is correct. Remittances from Indians working abroad constitute a significant inflow of foreign exchange into India.  This strengthens the country's foreign exchange reserves, making the currency more stable and reducing the vulnerability to currency crises.  These inflows help to maintain the balance of payments and provide a buffer against external shocks.


**22. With reference to measures taken by the government/RBI to stop the slide of the Indian Rupee, consider the following statements:**

1. Following an expansionary monetary policy helps stabilize the Rupee.
2. Curbing imports of non-essential goods promotes exports and helps stabilize the Rupee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy, which involves increasing the money supply, generally weakens a currency, not strengthens it.  Such a policy can lead to inflation and reduce the attractiveness of the currency in the foreign exchange market.

Statement 2 is correct. Curbing imports of non-essential goods reduces the demand for foreign currency, while promoting exports increases the supply of foreign currency.  This helps to improve the balance of payments and strengthen the Rupee's value.


**23. With reference to the money multiplier in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) increases the money multiplier.
2. An increase in the banking habit of the population increases the money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) actually *decreases* the money multiplier.  CRR is the percentage of deposits that banks are required to keep with the central bank.  A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thus lowering the money multiplier.

Statement 2 is correct.  An increase in the banking habit of the population means more people deposit their money in banks. This increases the amount of money banks can lend, leading to a higher money multiplier.  A higher proportion of money held in bank deposits increases the potential for money creation through the banking system.


**24. With reference to actions that could provide immunity to India during another global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1. Maintaining full capital account convertibility enhances resilience during a global financial crisis.
2. Not depending on short-term foreign borrowings reduces vulnerability during a global financial crisis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While capital account convertibility can offer certain benefits, maintaining full convertibility can also increase vulnerability during a global financial crisis.  A fully convertible capital account makes a country more susceptible to sudden capital outflows, leading to currency depreciation and other economic instability.  Controlled capital account management can provide a buffer against external shocks.

Statement 2 is correct.  Relying heavily on short-term foreign borrowings makes a country highly vulnerable to global financial crises.  When global liquidity dries up, it becomes difficult to refinance these short-term debts, leading to potential defaults and economic turmoil.  Reducing reliance on short-term debt enhances a country's resilience during such crises.


**25. With reference to the immediate effect of a large cash withdrawal from a demand deposit account, consider the following statements:**

1.  A large cash withdrawal reduces aggregate money supply proportionately.
2.  A large cash withdrawal increases the currency component of the money supply.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  When a large sum of money is withdrawn in cash from a demand deposit account, it directly reduces the money supply in the economy by the amount withdrawn.  This is because demand deposits are part of the M1 money supply (the most liquid form of money).

Statement 2 is correct.  The cash withdrawn from the demand deposit account increases the currency component of the money supply.  The money moves from a bank deposit (part of M1) to physical cash (also part of M1), changing its form but not necessarily its overall amount within M1.


**26. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. KCC provides credit for construction of family houses and village cold storage facilities.
2. KCC provides short-term credit for post-harvest expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme is primarily designed to provide short-term credit for agricultural purposes.  Long-term investments like house construction or setting up cold storage facilities are typically funded through other schemes.

Statement 2 is correct.  The KCC provides short-term credit to farmers for various agricultural purposes, including post-harvest expenses.  This credit helps farmers manage their finances throughout the agricultural cycle, from planting to selling their produce.


**27. With reference to financial instruments in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. Commercial Paper is a long-term unsecured promissory note.
2. Call money is a short-term finance used in interbank transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Commercial Paper (CP) is a *short-term*, unsecured promissory note issued by large corporations to raise short-term funds from the market.  It's a money market instrument used for bridging short-term funding gaps.

Statement 2 is correct. Call money is a short-term interbank lending instrument used for managing liquidity in the banking system.  Banks borrow and lend call money for very short periods (typically overnight or for a few days) to meet their immediate funding requirements.


**28. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI primarily involves investment through capital instruments in listed companies.
2. FDI is characterized as a largely non-debt-creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FDI can involve investments in listed companies, it's not limited to them. FDI can also take the form of equity investments in unlisted companies, joint ventures, or the establishment of wholly-owned subsidiaries.  The investment can be in various forms depending on the investor's strategy and the nature of the investment project.

Statement 2 is correct. FDI is primarily equity investment, not debt financing.  It represents a long-term commitment by the investor to the enterprise, unlike debt which requires repayment of principal and interest.  Therefore, FDI is usually characterized as a non-debt-creating capital flow.


**29. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the President of India.
2. The RBI Act grants the RBI Governor his/her powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Although the appointment is technically done by the President of India, it is done on the advice of the Central Government. This highlights the government's influence on the appointment process.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI Governor's powers and responsibilities are primarily derived from the RBI Act, 1934.  This Act outlines the RBI's functions, its autonomy, and the powers vested in the Governor.


**30. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. UCBs are regulated and supervised by local boards set up by State Governments.
2. UCBs can issue both equity and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While State Governments play a role in overseeing UCBs, the primary regulatory authority for UCBs is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  The RBI sets the guidelines and conducts inspections to ensure the sound financial health and regulatory compliance of UCBs.

Statement 2 is correct. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) have the power to issue both equity shares and preference shares to raise capital.  This is a common feature of their corporate structure, allowing them to diversify their funding sources.


**31. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following statements:**

1.  Actions of the United States Federal Reserve have no impact on Indian Government Bond Yields.
2. Inflation significantly influences Indian Government Bond Yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Actions of the United States Federal Reserve (the US central bank) can indirectly impact Indian Government Bond Yields.  Global financial conditions, including interest rate decisions by major central banks like the Fed, affect investor sentiment and capital flows, which in turn influence bond yields in various countries, including India.

Statement 2 is correct. Inflation is a major determinant of government bond yields.  Higher inflation expectations lead to higher bond yields as investors demand a higher return to compensate for the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation.  The relationship between inflation and bond yields is an important aspect of macroeconomic analysis.


**32. With reference to what can be included in Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), consider the following:**

1. Foreign currency convertible bonds are included in FDI.
2. Global depository receipts are included in FDI.

Which of the above can be included in Foreign Direct Investments?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Foreign currency convertible bonds are considered a form of foreign portfolio investment, not foreign direct investment (FDI).  While they involve foreign capital, they do not represent a direct ownership stake or control in a domestic enterprise.

Statement 2 is correct. Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) represent a form of FDI.  They allow foreign investors to purchase shares of a domestic company listed on a foreign stock exchange, giving them indirect ownership and, potentially, influence over the company's operations.


**33. With reference to the effects of currency devaluation, consider the following statements:**

1. Currency devaluation necessarily improves the trade balance.
2. Currency devaluation necessarily improves the competitiveness of domestic exports.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While currency devaluation can make exports cheaper and imports more expensive, it doesn't guarantee an improvement in the trade balance.  The impact on the trade balance depends on several factors, including the elasticity of demand for exports and imports, the response of other countries, and the overall global economic conditions.

Statement 2 is correct. Currency devaluation makes domestic goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers, thus improving the price competitiveness of exports in international markets.  This is a direct consequence of the change in the exchange rate.


**34. With reference to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following:**

1. Expansionary fiscal policies contribute to demand-

**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  It primarily aims to provide collateral-free loans to small entrepreneurs.
2.  The scheme is exclusively designed for women entrepreneurs in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a government initiative aimed at promoting entrepreneurship among small and micro-businesses.  Statement 1 is correct because a core tenet of PMMY is providing collateral-free loans to enable access to finance for individuals who might otherwise struggle to secure funding through traditional banking channels. This fosters financial inclusion and supports the growth of small businesses.  Statement 2 is incorrect because PMMY is not exclusively for women entrepreneurs in rural areas. While women and rural entrepreneurs are significant beneficiaries, the scheme is open to all eligible individuals regardless of gender or location.  The scheme's broad reach underscores its goal of fostering a more inclusive and vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem across India.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the scheme's target beneficiaries and objectives.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the "Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme" and "Gold Monetization Scheme":**

1.  These schemes aim to reduce India's reliance on gold imports by mobilizing domestic gold reserves.
2.  Both schemes primarily focus on attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are government initiatives designed to address India's significant gold import dependency and to better utilize the large amount of gold held within the country. Statement 1 correctly identifies a key objective: to reduce reliance on gold imports.  By encouraging individuals and institutions to invest in gold bonds or monetize their existing gold holdings, the schemes aim to bring idle gold into the formal financial system, thereby lessening the need for imports. Statement 2 is incorrect. While FDI might indirectly benefit from a more structured gold market created by these schemes, the primary focus is not on attracting FDI. Instead, the schemes aim to improve domestic resource management and enhance financial stability.  Option (a) accurately reflects the primary goal of these schemes, while the other options present a distorted or incomplete understanding of their purpose.


**3. With reference to Bitcoins, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transactions using Bitcoins are anonymous and untraceable by any authority.
2.  Bitcoins are regulated and monitored by central banks globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Bitcoins are a decentralized digital currency, operating independently of central banks and governments.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bitcoin transactions offer a degree of pseudonimity (using Bitcoin addresses instead of names), they are not entirely anonymous. Blockchain technology records all transactions publicly, allowing for tracing of Bitcoin movements though the identity of individuals involved might not always be immediately apparent. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Central banks do not regulate or monitor Bitcoins directly. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes it difficult for any single entity to control or oversee its transactions.  The inherent characteristics of Bitcoin as a decentralized cryptocurrency render both statements inaccurate.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d).


**4. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  NPCI's primary function is to facilitate the transfer of funds between banks.
2.  RuPay, a domestic card payment network, is a product of NPCI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a crucial player in India's financial infrastructure. Statement 1 is correct. NPCI plays a vital role in facilitating interbank fund transfers, significantly streamlining financial transactions across the country.  It operates various payment systems like IMPS, NEFT, and RTGS, which are critical for efficient money movement. Statement 2 is also correct.  RuPay is a domestic card payment network developed and managed by NPCI. RuPay aims to provide an alternative to international card networks, enhancing India's payment system independence.  Both statements accurately capture NPCI's role and contribution to the Indian financial system, making (c) the correct option.


**5. With reference to the Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SFBs are primarily focused on serving the financial needs of small and marginal farmers.
2.  SFBs are prohibited from offering services such as credit cards or debit cards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India have a specific mandate to cater to underserved segments of the population. Statement 1 is incorrect. While SFBs are expected to provide credit and financial services to rural populations, including farmers, their focus is not exclusively on small and marginal farmers. They serve a broader range of customers, including small businesses and individuals. Statement 2 is also incorrect. SFBs are allowed to offer a range of financial products and services, including credit cards and debit cards, subject to regulatory compliance.  The aim is to provide a comprehensive set of banking services to their target customer base. Thus, both statements are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer.


**6. With reference to the "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1.  MDR is a fee charged to merchants by banks for accepting digital payments.
2.  MDR is a subsidy provided by the government to encourage digital transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a crucial component of the digital payments ecosystem. Statement 1 is correct. MDR is a fee charged by banks to merchants for processing digital payments made through credit or debit cards. This fee covers the transaction processing costs and other related expenses. Statement 2 is incorrect. MDR is not a government subsidy.  While the government may implement policies to incentivize digital transactions, MDR itself is a fee borne by the merchant and is not a form of government financial assistance.  The correct answer is (a) as it accurately reflects the nature and function of MDR within the digital payments system.


**7. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Legal tender money refers to banknotes and coins issued by the central bank.
2.  A creditor is legally obligated to accept all forms of payment, including cheques, as legal tender.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Legal tender money holds a specific legal standing within an economy. Statement 1 is correct. Legal tender money typically refers to banknotes and coins issued by the central bank or monetary authority of a country. These are the forms of currency that are legally acceptable for settling debts. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While cheques are commonly used for transactions, they are not considered legal tender. A creditor is not legally compelled to accept a cheque as payment.  The legal obligation to accept payment applies only to the designated legal tender currency issued by the central bank. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate choice.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1.  The RBI manages and services both Central and State Government securities.
2.  Treasury bills are issued only by the Central Government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has a multifaceted role in managing India's financial system. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI manages and services Central Government securities, its role in managing State Government securities is limited.  The management and servicing of State Government securities are primarily handled by other agencies. Statement 2 is correct. Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued by the Central Government to finance its short-term borrowing needs. State Governments typically issue their own short-term debt instruments, but these are not technically referred to as treasury bills. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer.


**9. With reference to the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), consider the following statements:**

1.  CAR is a measure of a bank's ability to absorb losses without becoming insolvent.
2.  Each individual bank decides its own CAR based on its risk assessment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a crucial regulatory requirement for banks globally. Statement 1 is correct. CAR is a measure of a bank's capital in relation to its risk-weighted assets.  A higher CAR indicates a bank's greater ability to absorb potential losses from bad loans or other financial setbacks without becoming insolvent.  This is a critical element of financial stability. Statement 2 is incorrect. CAR is not decided by individual banks.  It is set by regulatory authorities, such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in India, based on international standards (Basel norms) and domestic considerations of financial stability.  These regulations ensure a minimum level of capital for all banks to maintain financial soundness within the banking system. Thus, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option.


**10. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deposits held by customers are considered assets of the bank.
2.  Advances (loans) given to customers are considered liabilities of the bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Understanding the balance sheet of a commercial bank is essential for comprehending its financial health. Statement 1 is incorrect. Deposits are liabilities for the bank, not assets.  The bank owes these funds to its customers.  The bank uses these deposited funds to provide loans and investments. Statement 2 is correct. Advances (loans) given to customers are assets of the bank.  These represent the bank's lending activities, and the repayment of these loans constitutes a future inflow of funds.  The correct option is (b) because it accurately reflects the fundamental accounting principle of classifying deposits as liabilities and advances as assets on a bank's balance sheet.


**11. With reference to factors contributing to reducing the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Increased government expenditure always strengthens a nation's currency.
2.  Remittances from Indians working abroad contribute to foreign exchange reserves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Currency crises are complex events influenced by various macroeconomic factors. Statement 1 is incorrect. Increased government expenditure can, under certain circumstances, weaken a nation's currency.  If the increased spending leads to higher inflation or a widening current account deficit, it could put downward pressure on the exchange rate.  Fiscal discipline is crucial for maintaining currency stability. Statement 2 is correct. Remittances from Indians working abroad represent a significant inflow of foreign currency into India.  This inflow directly boosts foreign exchange reserves, enhancing the country's ability to withstand external shocks and reduce the risk of a currency crisis.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.


**12. With reference to measures taken by the Government/RBI to stop the slide of the Indian rupee, consider the following statements:**

1.  Easing conditions for external commercial borrowing (ECB) strengthens the rupee.
2.  Following an expansionary monetary policy typically supports the rupee's value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Managing exchange rate fluctuations requires careful policy interventions. Statement 1 is incorrect. Easing conditions for external commercial borrowing (ECB) can actually weaken the rupee.  Increased inflow of foreign currency through ECBs can increase the supply of rupees in the foreign exchange market, potentially putting downward pressure on the rupee's value. Statement 2 is also incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy, which involves increasing the money supply, typically weakens the currency.  This is because increased money supply can lead to higher inflation, making the currency less attractive to foreign investors.  Contractionary monetary policies are usually employed to support a weakening currency.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect, resulting in (d) being the correct answer.


**13. With reference to the money multiplier in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) increases the money multiplier.
2.  An increase in the banking habit of the population increases the money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The money multiplier is a crucial concept in monetary economics. Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) actually decreases the money multiplier.  CRR is the percentage of deposits that banks are required to keep with the central bank.  A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thereby lowering the money multiplier. Statement 2 is correct.  Increased banking habits lead to a higher money multiplier.  When more people deposit their money in banks, banks have more funds available to lend, increasing the money supply and thus the money multiplier.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.


**14.  With reference to actions/policies that might give India some immunity from another global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility enhances resilience against global shocks.
2.  Reducing dependence on short-term foreign borrowings minimizes vulnerability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Protecting an economy from global financial crises requires strategic policy choices. Statement 1 is incorrect. While capital account convertibility allows for free flow of capital, it can also increase vulnerability to global shocks.  Sudden capital outflows during a crisis can destabilize the economy.  Managed capital account convertibility is often preferred to mitigate such risks. Statement 2 is correct.  Reducing reliance on short-term foreign borrowings is crucial.  Short-term debt is more susceptible to sudden reversals during a crisis, potentially triggering a balance of payments problem.  Long-term borrowing offers greater stability. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.


**15. With reference to the immediate effect on aggregate money supply when cash is withdrawn from a demand deposit account, consider the following statements:**

1.  The money supply decreases by the exact amount withdrawn.
2.  The money supply remains unchanged as it is simply a transfer of money.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Understanding the impact of cash withdrawals on money supply requires a nuanced approach. Statement 1 is largely correct.  When cash is withdrawn from a demand deposit account, the immediate effect is a reduction in the money supply by the amount withdrawn.  This is because demand deposits are part of the money supply (M1), and the withdrawal converts a deposit into physical currency. However, the effect might not be exactly equal to the amount withdrawn due to the complexities of the money multiplier. Statement 2 is incorrect. It is not a simple transfer. The withdrawal reduces the money supply available for lending and transactions within the banking system.  The correct answer is (a) because it captures the primary, immediate impact on the money supply.


**16. With reference to the purposes of short-term credit support under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  KCC provides funds for the consumption requirements of farm households.
2.  KCC covers expenses related to the construction of a family house.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme is designed to provide timely credit to farmers for various agricultural needs. Statement 1 is largely correct. KCC credit can be used to meet some consumption needs of farm households, particularly those directly linked to agricultural activities, like purchasing seeds, fertilizers, or other inputs. However, it's not primarily meant for general consumption. Statement 2 is incorrect. KCC is not intended for financing non-agricultural expenses such as house construction.  The scheme focuses on supporting agricultural production and related activities. Therefore, only statement 1 is partially correct, making (a) the most appropriate answer.


**17. With reference to financial instruments in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Commercial Paper is a long-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations.
2.  Call money is a short-term finance instrument used primarily for interbank transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Understanding the characteristics of various financial instruments is essential for analyzing the Indian financial market. Statement 1 is incorrect. Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term unsecured promissory note, typically issued by large corporations to raise short-term funds. It is not a long-term instrument. Statement 2 is correct. Call money is indeed a short-term interbank lending instrument used for managing liquidity and meeting short-term fund requirements.  The correct answer is (b) as it correctly identifies the nature of call money.


**18. With reference to the major characteristics of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FDI primarily involves investment through capital instruments in listed companies.
2.  FDI is a largely non-debt-creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plays a significant role in India's economic development. Statement 1 is incorrect. While FDI can involve investment in listed companies, it is not limited to this. FDI can take various forms, including setting up new ventures, joint ventures, or acquiring existing businesses, both listed and unlisted. Statement 2 is largely correct. FDI is generally considered a non-debt-creating capital flow. It represents equity investment rather than borrowing from external sources. However, there might be exceptions where debt financing is involved alongside equity investment.  Therefore, statement 2 is more accurate than statement 1, making (b) the correct option.


**19. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI Governor's appointment is subject to the approval of the Parliament.
2.  The RBI Act empowers the RBI Governor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) operates under a specific legal framework. Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI Governor is appointed by the Central Government, not through parliamentary approval.  The government's executive power allows for this appointment. Statement 2 is correct. The RBI Governor's powers and responsibilities are primarily derived from the RBI Act, which outlines the central bank's functions and regulatory authority.  The RBI Act provides a legal basis for the Governor's actions.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer.


**20. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  UCBs are directly supervised and regulated by the RBI.
2.  UCBs are permitted to issue both equity and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) operate under a specific regulatory framework. Statement 1 is correct. Although they are cooperative institutions, UCBs are now under the direct supervision and regulation of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) following amendments to the Banking Regulation Act. This ensures greater oversight and stability within the cooperative banking sector. Statement 2 is also correct. UCBs are allowed to issue both equity and preference shares to raise capital. This is a common feature of cooperative financial institutions and allows them to diversify their funding sources.  Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer.


**21. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following statements:**

1.  Actions of the United States Federal Reserve have minimal impact on Indian bond yields.
2.  Inflation and short-term interest rates significantly influence bond yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Government bond yields are influenced by a complex interplay of macroeconomic factors. Statement 1 is incorrect. Actions of the US Federal Reserve (the US central bank) can significantly influence Indian government bond yields.  Changes in US interest rates, monetary policy, and economic conditions often affect global capital flows, including those into and out of India's bond market. This impacts the demand for Indian bonds and, consequently, their yields. Statement 2 is correct. Inflation and short-term interest rates are key determinants of bond yields.  Higher inflation expectations generally lead to higher bond yields as investors demand a higher return to compensate for the erosion of purchasing power. Similarly, rising short-term interest rates make bonds less attractive, potentially pushing up their yields. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.


**22. With reference to instruments that can be included in Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds are a form of FDI.
2.  Non-resident external (NRE) deposits are considered FDI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has a specific definition in international finance. Statement 1 is incorrect. Foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) are debt instruments, not equity investments.  While they can be issued by companies to raise capital, they do not represent direct ownership or control, which is a defining characteristic of FDI.  They are a form of external commercial borrowing. Statement 2 is also incorrect. NRE deposits are simply deposits made by non-resident Indians in Indian banks.  These are not considered FDI because they do not represent direct investment in productive assets within the country.  They are a form of foreign currency inflow, but not FDI.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer.


**23. With reference to the effect of currency devaluation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Devaluation necessarily improves a country's trade balance.
2.  Devaluation makes domestic exports more competitive in foreign markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Currency devaluation is a complex policy tool with varying effects. Statement 1 is incorrect. While devaluation aims to improve the trade balance by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive, it does not guarantee an improvement.  The actual impact depends on several factors, including the price elasticity of demand for exports and imports, as well as the reactions of other countries.  It's possible that devaluation could worsen the trade balance under certain circumstances. Statement 2 is correct. Devaluation makes domestic goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers, thus boosting their competitiveness in the global market.  This is a direct consequence of the exchange rate adjustment. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.


**24. With reference to factors that can cause or increase demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Expansionary fiscal policies contribute to demand-pull inflation.
2.  Rising interest rates typically exacerbate demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand outpaces aggregate supply. Statement 1 is correct. Expansionary fiscal policies, such as increased government spending or tax cuts, can boost aggregate demand. If this increase in demand is not matched by a corresponding increase in supply, it can lead to demand-pull inflation.  This is because higher demand pushes up prices. Statement 2 is incorrect. Rising interest rates typically curb demand-pull inflation.  Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, reducing investment and consumer spending, thereby lowering aggregate demand.  This helps to cool down inflationary pressures.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option.



**1. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Investment in health, including preventive and curative medicine, significantly contributes to human capital formation by increasing the supply of a healthy workforce.
2. Migration, while involving costs, can be a source of human capital formation if enhanced earnings in the new location outweigh the migration costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Investment in health is a crucial component of human capital formation.  A healthy workforce is more productive, leading to higher economic output.  Preventive measures like vaccination reduce healthcare costs and lost productivity due to illness, while curative medicine addresses existing health issues, improving worker efficiency.  The text explicitly mentions health expenditure as a source of human capital formation, highlighting its impact on the supply of healthy labor.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Internal and international migration often involves significant costs, including transportation, relocation, and adapting to a new environment. However, if the potential for higher earnings in the destination surpasses these costs, migration contributes positively to human capital formation. Individuals gain skills and experience in new settings, increasing their overall productivity and earning potential. The text clearly indicates that migration, despite its costs, can be a source of human capital if the return on investment (higher earnings) outweighs the expenses.  This aligns with the economic understanding of human capital as an investment with potential returns.


**2. Consider the following statements about the Indian economy:**

1.  An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) signifies a weakening of the Indian Rupee against a basket of currencies.
2.  A rise in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates a deterioration in India's trade competitiveness.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in NEER indicates an appreciation (strengthening) of the domestic currency, not a weakening.  NEER is calculated by weighting the exchange rates of the domestic currency against a basket of other currencies. An increase means the domestic currency is appreciating relative to that basket.

Statement 2 is correct. An increase in REER suggests a loss of trade competitiveness. REER adjusts NEER for inflation differentials between the domestic economy and its trading partners. If REER increases, it implies that the domestic currency has become relatively more expensive, making exports less competitive and imports more attractive, thereby hurting the trade balance.


**3. With reference to the measurement of poverty in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Tendulkar Committee recommended a poverty line based solely on nutritional requirements.
2.  The Rangarajan Committee's poverty line incorporated a broader range of factors beyond just nutritional needs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Tendulkar Committee's poverty line considered nutritional requirements as a significant factor, it also included other essential needs like clothing and shelter. It wasn't exclusively based on nutritional needs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rangarajan Committee's poverty line broadened the scope of factors considered compared to its predecessors. It incorporated a wider range of consumption needs, reflecting a more comprehensive approach to poverty measurement.  This acknowledges the multidimensional nature of poverty, recognizing that it goes beyond mere calorie intake.  The committee aimed for a more realistic and inclusive estimation of poverty levels.


**4. With reference to India's infrastructure, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP is significantly higher than that of China.
2.  The composition of infrastructure needs shifts from basic services like irrigation and transport in low-income countries to more service-oriented infrastructure in high-income countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that India invests only 5% of its GDP on infrastructure, which is considerably lower than China's investment.  This highlights a significant gap in infrastructure development between the two countries.

Statement 2 is correct. The nature of infrastructure requirements evolves with economic development.  Low-income countries prioritize basic infrastructure to support agriculture and industry. As incomes rise and economies mature, the demand for service-oriented infrastructure (telecommunications, advanced transportation) increases. This reflects the changing economic structure and consumption patterns in high-income countries.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding subsidies in India:**

1.  Price subsidies are always progressive, benefiting low-income households more than high-income households.
2.  Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) aims to reduce leakages and improve the efficiency of subsidy delivery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Price subsidies are often regressive, meaning wealthier households tend to benefit more due to higher consumption. For instance, subsidies on electricity disproportionately favor wealthier households who consume more electricity.  This contradicts the intended purpose of subsidies to aid the poor.

Statement 2 is correct. DBT, by transferring subsidies directly into beneficiaries' accounts, aims to minimize leakages and improve targeting efficiency.  Traditional methods of subsidy distribution often suffer from inefficiencies and corruption, leading to resources not reaching the intended recipients. DBT seeks to address these issues by streamlining the process and enhancing transparency.


**6. With reference to macroeconomic indicators, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nominal GDP reflects the value of goods and services at current market prices, while real GDP adjusts for inflation.
2.  The GDP deflator is a measure of the overall price level, calculated as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nominal GDP uses current prices, making it susceptible to inflation's influence. Real GDP, on the other hand, employs a base year's prices, removing the effect of inflation and providing a clearer picture of actual economic growth.

Statement 2 is also correct. The GDP deflator is a key macroeconomic indicator used to measure inflation. It's computed by dividing nominal GDP by real GDP.  An increase in the GDP deflator signifies inflation, indicating a rise in the overall price level.  It provides insights into price changes across the entire economy.


**7.  With reference to the concept of poverty, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dadabhai Naoroji's poverty line calculation was based on the cost of living for an adult in jail, adjusted for the presence of children in a typical household.
2.  The identification of the poor relies solely on occupation and asset ownership, providing a complete picture of poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji’s pioneering work on poverty estimation utilized the cost of living for a prisoner as a starting point, recognizing that this was a basic subsistence level.  He then adjusted this figure to account for the different needs of a household with children, making his approach more relevant to the broader population.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While occupation and asset ownership are important indicators, they don't fully capture the multifaceted nature of poverty.  Poverty is a complex phenomenon encompassing various dimensions, including health, education, access to basic amenities, and vulnerability to risks. Relying solely on occupation and asset ownership would provide an incomplete and potentially misleading picture.


**8. With reference to rural development in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Improving infrastructure in rural areas, including banking and communication facilities, is crucial for realizing the true potential of rural development.
2.  Diversification away from agriculture towards non-agricultural activities is unnecessary, as agriculture alone can ensure sustainable rural livelihoods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Adequate infrastructure is essential for rural development.  Improved banking facilities provide access to credit, while better communication networks facilitate market access and information dissemination.  These are crucial for enhancing productivity and economic opportunities in rural areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Relying solely on agriculture for rural livelihoods is risky and unsustainable.  Diversification into non-agricultural activities creates alternative income streams, reduces dependence on a single sector, and provides resilience to economic shocks.  This is important for ensuring sustainable rural livelihoods and reducing poverty.


**9. Consider the following statements about employment in India:**

1.  All individuals engaged in economic activities, regardless of their employment status (paid or self-employed), are considered workers.
2.  Estimating the number of workers includes only those who are paid by an employer, excluding self-employed individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The definition of a worker encompasses all individuals participating in economic activities, whether employed by others or self-employed.  This broad definition captures the full extent of labor contribution to the economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The estimation of the workforce includes both those employed by others and the self-employed.  Excluding self-employed individuals would significantly underrepresent the actual size of the workforce and its contribution to the national economy.  Self-employment is a significant part of the Indian economy, especially in rural areas.


**10. With reference to Public Goods, consider the following statements:**

1. Public goods are both non-rivalrous and non-excludable.
2.  Examples of public goods include police services and border security services.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The defining characteristics of public goods are non-rivalry (one person's consumption doesn't diminish another's) and non-excludability (it's difficult to prevent anyone from consuming the good).  These characteristics differentiate public goods from private goods.

Statement 2 is also correct. Police services and border security are classic examples of public goods. Their benefits are enjoyed by society as a whole, and it's impractical to exclude individuals from these services.  These are provided by the government, reflecting their public nature and the challenges of private provision.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to poverty, development, and human capital formation in India.  Remember that the questions are designed to be challenging and may contain distractors.

**1. With reference to the evolution of poverty alleviation strategies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The initial growth-oriented approach, prevalent in the 1950s and early 1960s, primarily focused on trickle-down effects of rapid industrial and agricultural growth to benefit the poor.
2.  The subsequent shift towards targeted poverty alleviation programs, starting from the Third Five-Year Plan, emphasized asset creation and work generation through schemes like Food for Work.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The initial approach to poverty reduction in post-independent India was indeed growth-oriented, relying on the belief that overall economic expansion would automatically uplift the poor.  This is reflected in the early Five-Year Plans' emphasis on industrialization and the Green Revolution. However, this strategy proved insufficient, leading to a shift towards more targeted programs aimed at directly addressing poverty through asset creation and employment generation. Programs like Food for Work, initiated in the 1970s and expanded upon in subsequent plans, exemplify this transition.  Therefore, both statements accurately capture the evolution of poverty alleviation strategies in India.


**2. With reference to the measurement of poverty in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji's early estimation of the poverty line utilized the "jail cost of living" as a baseline, adjusting for the inclusion of children in the broader population.
2.  The Planning Commission consistently relied solely on the headcount ratio to determine poverty levels, disregarding other indicators like consumption expenditure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji's pioneering work on poverty estimation did indeed use a "jail cost of living" approach as a starting point, recognizing the need to account for the age structure of the general population, unlike the relatively homogenous age group within prisons.  However, the Planning Commission's methodology for poverty estimation was more nuanced and involved multiple indicators, including consumption expenditure data gathered by the NSSO. The headcount ratio was one element, but not the sole determinant, used to determine poverty levels. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**3. With reference to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act guarantees a minimum of 150 days of unskilled manual work per year to every rural household volunteer.
2. The Act ensures that all those who are ready to work at the minimum wage will be provided employment in areas where the program is implemented.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NREGA 2005, now MGNREGA, aims to provide a minimum of 100 days of guaranteed wage employment per year to every rural household that volunteers to do unskilled manual work.  The act's core principle is to provide employment at the minimum wage to those who are willing to work, within the areas where the program is operational.  Statement 1 incorrectly states the number of guaranteed days, while statement 2 correctly reflects the program's fundamental goal.


**4. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Investment in education is the sole significant source of human capital formation, overshadowing the impact of health investments and on-the-job training.
2. Migration, though involving costs, contributes to human capital formation by enabling individuals to access higher-paying jobs and enhance their skills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While investment in education is crucial, human capital formation is a multi-faceted process encompassing various factors.  Health investments, on-the-job training, and even migration play significant roles in enhancing human capabilities and productivity.  Statement 1 is incorrect as it oversimplifies the sources of human capital. Statement 2 is correct; migration, despite its associated costs, contributes to human capital formation by allowing individuals to acquire better employment opportunities and potentially develop new skills.


**5. With reference to inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth solely focuses on accelerating the pace of economic growth without considering its distributional effects.
2.  Addressing the issue of poverty is a secondary objective, subordinate to achieving high rates of GDP growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Inclusive growth is not simply about maximizing GDP growth; it fundamentally emphasizes equitable distribution of the benefits of growth.  It aims to ensure that all segments of the population, especially marginalized groups, participate in and benefit from economic progress.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect. Inclusive growth explicitly addresses poverty reduction as a primary objective, recognizing that high GDP growth alone is insufficient for overall societal well-being.


**6.  With reference to the challenges to inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The persistence of a large agricultural workforce with low productivity and wages is a major obstacle to inclusive growth.
2.  Regional disparities in income and development levels pose minimal challenges to achieving inclusive growth across the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The over-reliance on agriculture, characterized by low productivity and wages for a significant portion of the Indian workforce, is a major impediment to inclusive growth. This limits income opportunities and contributes to persistent poverty and inequality.  Statement 2 is incorrect; significant regional disparities in development levels are a substantial challenge to achieving inclusive growth across India. The vast differences in per capita income and access to resources between states like Punjab and Bihar exemplify this challenge.


**7. With reference to the role of the government in promoting inclusive growth, consider the following statements:**

1. The government's role is primarily limited to direct income redistribution through transfer schemes.
2.  Investment in rural infrastructure, agriculture, and human capital development are key components of a successful inclusive growth strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While income redistribution can be a short-term measure, the government's role in promoting inclusive growth extends far beyond this. Investment in rural infrastructure, agricultural improvements, and education and healthcare are vital for creating long-term opportunities and reducing inequality.  Statement 1 is incorrect because it underestimates the government's role.  Statement 2 accurately identifies crucial aspects of a holistic inclusive growth strategy.


**8. With reference to the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), consider the following statements:**

1. AIM is solely focused on promoting innovation within the Information Technology sector.
2.  One of AIM's objectives is to create a supportive ecosystem for innovation across various sectors of the Indian economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Atal Innovation Mission is not limited to the IT sector; it has a broader mandate to foster innovation across diverse sectors of the Indian economy.  Statement 1 is incorrect due to its narrow focus. Statement 2 accurately describes AIM's goal of creating a comprehensive innovation ecosystem, encompassing various programs and initiatives to support entrepreneurship and technological advancements across different fields.


**9. With reference to the National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy primarily focuses on short-term skill development programs, neglecting the need for lifelong learning.
2.  The policy aims to create a demand-driven skilling ecosystem that aligns with the needs of various sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015 emphasizes lifelong learning as a crucial element for individual empowerment and national development.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  The policy's core objective is to establish a skilling framework that responds to the evolving demands of various sectors, ensuring that the skills acquired are relevant to the job market.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this demand-driven approach.


**10. With reference to the  National Single Window System (NSWS), consider the following statements:**

1. NSWS is designed to increase bureaucratic hurdles and delays in obtaining business approvals.
2. The system aims to enhance transparency and accountability in the process of obtaining government approvals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Single Window System is designed to streamline the process of obtaining various government approvals and registrations for businesses and investors.  It aims to reduce bureaucratic delays and enhance transparency and accountability.  Statement 1 is entirely incorrect as it contradicts the system's fundamental purpose. Statement 2 correctly reflects the system's objectives to provide a more efficient and transparent investment environment.


**1. With reference to the sources of human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Investment in health, encompassing preventive medicine, curative medicine, and social medicine, significantly contributes to human capital formation by increasing the supply of a healthy workforce.
2.  Expenditure on migration, including transportation costs and adjustment costs in new environments, is considered a source of human capital formation only when the enhanced earnings in the new location outweigh the migration costs.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Investment in health is a crucial component of human capital formation.  A healthy population is more productive, leading to higher economic output.  Preventive measures (vaccinations), curative treatments (medical interventions), and social medicine (health literacy) all contribute to a healthier, more productive workforce.  The statement accurately reflects the economic understanding of health expenditure as an investment in human capital.

Statement 2 is also correct. Migration, while often associated with social and personal costs, can also be viewed through the lens of human capital formation.  Individuals migrate to seek better employment opportunities and higher wages.  If the increased earnings resulting from migration exceed the costs involved (transportation, relocation, adjustment to a new environment), then the migration itself becomes an investment in human capital, enhancing the individual's earning potential and overall contribution to the economy.  The statement correctly emphasizes the conditional nature of migration's contribution to human capital formation.


**2. With reference to the challenges and issues related to poverty alleviation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The growth-oriented approach to poverty reduction, which focused on the trickle-down effect of economic growth, has been largely ineffective in significantly reducing poverty and income inequality in India.
2.  While self-employment and wage employment programs aim to address poverty directly, their effectiveness is often hampered by issues such as unequal distribution of assets, leading to the appropriation of benefits by the non-poor.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The initial approach to poverty alleviation in India relied heavily on the assumption that overall economic growth would automatically lift the poor out of poverty.  However, experience has shown that this "trickle-down" effect is often limited and uneven.  While overall GDP growth might occur, the benefits are not always equitably distributed, leading to persistent poverty and widening income disparities.  The statement accurately reflects the shortcomings of this growth-oriented strategy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Various poverty alleviation programs focusing on self-employment and wage employment have been implemented in India.  However, their effectiveness is often undermined by unequal asset distribution.  The unequal distribution of land, capital, and other resources means that the benefits of these programs are often captured by wealthier individuals or groups, leaving the poorest sections of society largely unaffected.  This highlights a critical structural barrier to successful poverty reduction efforts.


**3. With reference to the implementation of subsidies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Price subsidies, while intended to help the poor, often lead to regressive outcomes where wealthier households benefit disproportionately due to higher consumption levels of subsidized goods and services.
2. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mechanisms, by transferring cash directly to beneficiaries, aim to enhance the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs by reducing leakages and distortions in the market caused by price subsidies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Price subsidies, while seemingly beneficial, often suffer from regressive effects.  Because wealthier households typically consume more of subsidized goods (electricity, water, LPG), they receive a larger share of the subsidy, thus exacerbating income inequality.  This highlights the unintended consequences of poorly designed subsidy programs.

Statement 2 is also correct.  DBT aims to address the shortcomings of traditional price subsidies. By directly transferring cash to eligible beneficiaries, DBT minimizes leakages and market distortions.  Beneficiaries can then purchase goods and services at market prices, allowing market mechanisms to operate more efficiently and reducing the potential for corruption and misallocation of resources.  The statement accurately captures the rationale behind the shift towards DBT.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy's infrastructure, consider the following statements:**

1.  The development of infrastructure, encompassing both economic and social components, plays a crucial role in boosting agricultural productivity by facilitating the efficient transportation of inputs and outputs.
2.  While India has made progress in certain areas of infrastructure development, its overall investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP remains significantly lower compared to several other countries, hindering its economic growth potential.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Infrastructure is a fundamental driver of economic productivity, and this is particularly true in agriculture.  Efficient transportation networks (roads, railways) are crucial for the timely movement of inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides) and outputs (harvested crops).  Inadequate infrastructure leads to increased transportation costs, spoilage of goods, and reduced market access, directly affecting agricultural productivity.  The statement correctly highlights the critical link between infrastructure and agricultural efficiency.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While India has undertaken significant infrastructure development initiatives, its investment levels remain comparatively low compared to many other nations.  This underinvestment acts as a constraint on economic growth.  Lower investment translates to inadequate infrastructure in various sectors, impeding industrial expansion, hindering access to essential services (healthcare, education), and affecting overall economic competitiveness. The statement correctly points out this significant challenge to India's economic development.


**5. With reference to the impact of economic reforms in India, consider the following statements:**

1. While the economic reforms led to increased GDP growth, they did not generate sufficient employment opportunities, leading to a persistent unemployment problem.
2.  The reforms in the agricultural sector, including reduced subsidies and increased exposure to international competition, have negatively impacted small and marginal farmers, resulting in agricultural stagnation in certain regions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's economic reforms, while boosting GDP growth, have not led to commensurate job creation.  This has resulted in high unemployment rates, particularly among the unskilled and semi-skilled workforce.  The reforms focused heavily on liberalization and privatization, which, while increasing efficiency in some sectors, did not adequately address the need for inclusive growth and employment generation.  The statement accurately reflects this crucial aspect of the reform's impact.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The agricultural sector in India has faced significant challenges due to economic reforms.  Reduced government subsidies, coupled with increased competition from cheaper agricultural imports, have disproportionately affected small and marginal farmers who lack the resources to compete effectively in a globalized market.  This has resulted in agricultural stagnation, income loss for farmers, and rural distress in many areas.  The statement accurately captures the adverse consequences of reform policies on this vital sector.


**6. With reference to the concept of trade deficits and their implications for an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  In an open economy, a trade deficit can be financed by net capital inflows from other countries, representing a capital account surplus.
2.  A trade deficit is always a cause for concern, indicating a country's unsustainable economic path and potential long-term financial instability.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A trade deficit, where a country imports more goods and services than it exports, is not inherently unsustainable.  It can be financed by net capital inflows from other countries.  This means that foreign investors are investing in the deficit country, providing the funds needed to cover the difference between imports and exports.  This inflow of capital can take various forms, such as foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and loans.  The statement accurately describes the mechanism by which trade deficits are financed in an open economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While a persistent and large trade deficit can be a cause for concern, it is not always an indicator of unsustainable economic practices.  The causes of trade deficits must be analyzed to determine their implications.  A trade deficit can arise from high investment levels (a positive sign), increased consumption (a potential negative), or government borrowing (a potential negative).  Simply having a trade deficit does not automatically mean an economy is on an unsustainable path. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate view of trade deficits.  A nuanced analysis is required to assess their implications.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  It aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing collateral-free microloans.
2.  The scheme primarily targets farmers by offering loans for specific crop cultivation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a flagship scheme of the Indian government aimed at promoting entrepreneurship among micro and small businesses.  Its core objective is to provide funding to individuals and small businesses who typically lack access to formal credit channels.  The scheme emphasizes collateral-free loans, making it accessible to those who might not meet traditional banking requirements. Therefore, statement 1 accurately reflects the scheme's primary goal. Statement 2 is incorrect; while PMMY might indirectly benefit farmers involved in small businesses, it's not primarily designed to provide agricultural loans. The scheme's focus is broader, encompassing various micro and small enterprises across diverse sectors.  The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the scheme's target beneficiaries or its core function.


**2. With reference to the Government’s Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  These schemes aim to reduce India's reliance on gold imports by mobilizing domestic gold holdings.
2.  A major objective is to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are initiatives designed to bring idle gold reserves held by households into the formal financial system. By encouraging individuals to invest in bonds or monetize their gold, these schemes aim to reduce India's heavy reliance on gold imports, thus improving the country's current account balance and strengthening its foreign exchange reserves.  This directly addresses statement 1. Statement 2 is incorrect; while these schemes might indirectly stimulate the gold and jewelry sector, their primary focus isn't attracting FDI.  The schemes primarily target domestic gold holdings and aim to improve domestic financial management.  The other options incorrectly link the schemes to FDI attraction or misrepresent their core objectives.


**3. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  NPCI's RuPay card payment scheme plays a significant role in promoting digital transactions and financial inclusion.
2.  NPCI primarily focuses on international transactions and facilitates cross-border payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is an entity that plays a crucial role in the Indian payment system.  NPCI's RuPay is a domestic card network that has significantly contributed to the growth of digital payments and financial inclusion in India. By providing an alternative to international card networks, RuPay has expanded access to financial services, particularly in rural and underserved areas, thus directly supporting statement 1. Statement 2 is incorrect; NPCI primarily operates within the Indian financial system, focusing on domestic transactions and payments. While NPCI might have some international collaborations, its core mandate remains domestic. The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent RuPay's function or mischaracterize NPCI's primary operational area.


**4. With reference to the purpose of setting up Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SFBs are primarily designed to cater to the credit needs of small and marginal farmers.
2.  A key objective of SFBs is to provide financial services to underserved populations, including small businesses and low-income households.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Small Finance Banks (SFBs) were established in India to address the credit needs of underserved sectors of the population.  While SFBs do extend credit to small and marginal farmers, their reach extends beyond agriculture.  They play a vital role in providing financial services to small businesses, low-income households, and other segments that are often overlooked by traditional commercial banks.  Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 reflect the objectives of SFBs, albeit with statement 2 offering a more comprehensive view of their target market. The other options fail to capture the broad mandate of SFBs in promoting financial inclusion.


**5. With reference to the term "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1.  MDR refers to the incentive a bank provides to a merchant for accepting payments through debit cards.
2.  MDR represents the charge levied on merchants by banks for processing payments made through their debit cards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a fee that banks charge merchants for processing payments made using debit or credit cards. It's a cost merchants incur for accepting card payments from customers.  Statement 2 accurately describes this aspect. Statement 1 is incorrect; MDR is not an incentive; it's a fee. While accepting card payments might indirectly benefit merchants by attracting more customers, the MDR itself is a cost, not a reward. The other options incorrectly portray MDR as an incentive or misrepresent its nature as a fee charged to merchants.


**6. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Legal tender money refers to the metallic currency in circulation within a country.
2.  Legal tender money is the currency that creditors are legally obligated to accept as payment for debts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Legal tender money refers to currency that a creditor is legally required to accept as payment for a debt.  This definition directly supports statement 2. Statement 1 is incorrect because legal tender encompasses more than just metallic currency; it includes banknotes and coins issued by the central bank. The other options are incorrect because they either limit the definition to metallic currency or misrepresent the legal obligation aspect of legal tender.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and its functions:**

1.  The RBI manages and services both Central and State Government securities.
2.  Treasury bills are exclusively issued by the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) acts as the central bank of India and manages the government's debt. While the RBI manages and services Central Government securities, its role in managing State Government securities is limited. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; treasury bills are primarily issued by the Central Government.  State governments might issue similar short-term debt instruments, but they are not technically called treasury bills.  The other options incorrectly represent the RBI's role in managing government securities or the issuer of treasury bills.


**8. With reference to the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), consider the following statements:**

1.  CAR is the amount banks must maintain as their own funds to cover potential losses from non-performing assets (NPAs).
2.  Each individual bank independently determines its CAR based on its risk assessment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a regulatory requirement for banks to maintain a minimum level of capital relative to their risk-weighted assets.  This capital acts as a buffer to absorb potential losses from bad loans or other risks.  Statement 1 correctly reflects this function. Statement 2 is incorrect; CAR is not determined by individual banks but is set by regulatory authorities (like the RBI in India) to ensure a minimum level of capital adequacy across the banking system.  The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the purpose of CAR or the process by which it is determined.


**9. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deposits held by customers are considered an asset of the bank.
2.  Advances (loans) given by the bank are considered an asset.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

For a commercial bank, advances (loans given to customers) represent assets because they are expected to generate future income through interest payments. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; deposits are liabilities for a bank, not assets.  Deposits represent money the bank owes to its customers.  The other options incorrectly classify deposits as assets or fail to correctly identify advances as assets.


**10.  With reference to factors contributing to reducing the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Remittances from Indians working abroad significantly contribute to foreign exchange reserves.
2.  Increasing government expenditure is a crucial measure for strengthening the rupee's value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) form a substantial part of India's foreign exchange earnings, bolstering the country's reserves and providing a cushion against currency fluctuations. This directly supports statement 1. Statement 2 is incorrect; increasing government expenditure can be inflationary and may actually weaken the currency if not managed carefully.  Fiscal prudence and responsible spending are more likely to help maintain currency stability.  The other options incorrectly link increased government expenditure to currency stability or misrepresent the role of remittances.


**11. With reference to measures the Government/RBI might take to prevent the slide of the Indian rupee, consider the following statements:**

1.  Implementing an expansionary monetary policy is a common tool used to strengthen the rupee.
2.  Curbing imports and promoting exports helps to improve the current account balance and support the rupee's value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

An expansionary monetary policy, while sometimes used to stimulate economic growth, can weaken a currency by increasing the money supply.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; managing trade balances is a key aspect of currency management. By reducing imports and boosting exports, a country can improve its current account, leading to increased demand for its currency and greater stability.  The other options incorrectly link expansionary monetary policies to currency strengthening or misrepresent the impact of trade policies.


**12. With reference to factors affecting the money multiplier in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) leads to a higher money multiplier.
2.  Increased banking habits among the population tend to increase the money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The money multiplier represents the extent to which an initial deposit can expand the overall money supply.  A higher CRR means banks hold a larger proportion of deposits as reserves, reducing the amount available for lending and thus lowering the money multiplier. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; as more people use banking services, more deposits are made available for banks to lend, thereby increasing the money multiplier.  The other options incorrectly link CRR to a higher multiplier or misrepresent the effect of increased banking habits.


**13.  With reference to actions that might provide immunity to India during another global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility is a crucial step in mitigating the impact of a global crisis.
2.  Reducing reliance on short-term foreign borrowings helps to reduce vulnerability to external shocks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Full capital account convertibility, while potentially beneficial in the long run, can increase vulnerability to sudden capital outflows during a global crisis.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; short-term foreign borrowings are particularly risky during global crises as they can be quickly withdrawn, creating financial instability.  Reducing reliance on such borrowings enhances resilience.  The other options incorrectly link full capital account convertibility to crisis immunity or misrepresent the role of short-term debt.


**14. With reference to the immediate effect of a large cash withdrawal from a demand deposit account, consider the following statements:**

1.  The aggregate money supply in the economy decreases by the amount withdrawn.
2.  The aggregate money supply increases by more than the amount withdrawn due to the money multiplier effect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

When a large sum is withdrawn in cash, the money leaves the banking system, directly reducing the money supply by the exact amount withdrawn.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the money multiplier effect is a real phenomenon, it operates when new deposits are made into the banking system, not when cash is withdrawn.  The withdrawal reduces the money supply directly without any immediate multiplier effect.  The other options incorrectly describe the multiplier effect or misrepresent the direct impact of cash withdrawals.


**15. With reference to the purposes for which short-term credit support is given to farmers under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  KCC provides funds for the construction of family houses and setting up village cold storage facilities.
2.  KCC covers working capital needs for farm asset maintenance and post-harvest expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme primarily focuses on providing short-term credit for agricultural activities. While KCC might indirectly benefit farmers who invest in infrastructure, its core function is to support working capital needs directly related to farming.  This includes funds for farm asset maintenance, purchasing inputs, and managing post-harvest expenses.  Statement 2 accurately reflects these aspects. Statement 1 is incorrect; KCC does not typically cover long-term investments like house construction or large-scale infrastructure projects. These would be addressed through other government schemes. The other options incorrectly include long-term investments or fail to capture the core short-term nature of KCC support.


**16. With reference to Commercial Paper, Certificates of Deposit, and Call Money in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations.
2.  Certificates of Deposit are long-term instruments issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to corporations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term debt instrument issued by large, creditworthy corporations to raise short-term funds from the market.  It is typically unsecured.  Statement 1 correctly describes this. Statement 2 is incorrect; Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term debt instruments issued by banks, not the RBI, to raise funds.  The RBI does not directly issue CDs to corporations. The other options incorrectly describe the issuers or maturities of CP and CDs.


**17. With reference to the characteristics of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FDI primarily involves investments made by foreign institutional investors in government securities.
2.  FDI is characterized by a largely non-debt-creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) involves long-term investments made by foreign entities in domestic businesses to acquire ownership or control.  It is different from portfolio investment in securities.  Statement 1 is incorrect; FDI does not primarily involve government securities; it involves direct ownership in businesses. Statement 2 is correct; FDI typically represents equity investments or direct capital infusions, which are not debt-based.  The other options incorrectly link FDI to government securities or misrepresent its non-debt nature.


**18. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Central Government, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Central Government.
2.  The Constitution of India grants the Central Government the power to issue directions to the RBI in matters of public interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the President of India based on the advice of the Central Government.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. The Constitution allows the Central Government to issue directions to the RBI in the public interest.  This is a provision to ensure that the RBI's actions align with the overall economic policies of the government.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The other options incorrectly represent the appointment process or the constitutional relationship between the government and the RBI.


**19. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  UCBs are supervised and regulated by local boards established by the State Governments.
2.  UCBs are now brought under the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While UCBs were previously under the purview of state-level cooperative societies acts,  an amendment to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, brought them under its ambit. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is largely incorrect; although state governments play a role in their oversight, the RBI also has regulatory authority over UCBs.  The regulatory framework is not exclusively at the state level. The other options incorrectly depict the regulatory framework for UCBs.


**20. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following statements:**

1.  Actions of the United States Federal Reserve (US Fed) have a significant impact on Indian bond yields.
2.  Inflation and short-term interest rates within India are major determinants of bond yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Global factors, such as actions by the US Federal Reserve, influence global interest rates and capital flows, which in turn impact Indian bond yields.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Domestic factors such as inflation and short-term interest rates are also crucial determinants of bond yields in India.  Higher inflation usually leads to higher bond yields as investors demand a higher return to compensate for inflation erosion.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct. The other options incorrectly isolate one factor or fail to recognize the influence of both global and domestic factors.


**21. With reference to what constitutes Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds are considered a form of FDI.
2.  Non-resident external deposits are a form of FDI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency convertible bonds are a form of foreign portfolio investment, not FDI.  They represent debt instruments that can be converted into equity, but they don't necessarily involve direct ownership or control. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Non-resident external deposits are simply deposits held by non-residents in Indian banks; they do not represent direct investment in Indian businesses.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The other options incorrectly classify either convertible bonds or external deposits as FDI.


**22. With reference to the effects of currency devaluation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Devaluation necessarily improves a country's trade balance.
2.  Devaluation makes domestic exports more competitive in foreign markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While devaluation can make exports cheaper and more attractive, it doesn't guarantee an improved trade balance. Other factors, such as import demand elasticity, can influence the outcome.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; devaluation makes domestic goods relatively cheaper for foreign buyers, thereby boosting export competitiveness.  The other options incorrectly link devaluation to a guaranteed trade balance improvement or fail to acknowledge the impact on export competitiveness.


**23. With reference to factors that can cause or increase demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rising interest rates are a primary cause of demand-pull inflation.
2.  Expansionary fiscal policies can fuel demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Rising interest rates tend to curb inflation by reducing borrowing and investment, thus dampening aggregate demand.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Expansionary fiscal policies, involving increased government spending or tax cuts, can boost aggregate demand, leading to demand-pull inflation if the economy is operating near its full capacity.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. The other options incorrectly link rising interest rates to demand-pull inflation or fail to recognize the inflationary impact of expansionary fiscal policies.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the target content (primarily focused on economic development and poverty),  questions related to polity and governance are limited and require some interpretation to fit the format.  The focus is on creating challenging questions that test factual recall, analysis, and understanding of economic concepts.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding human capital formation in India:**

1. Investment in health, including preventive and curative medicine, significantly contributes to human capital formation by increasing the supply of a healthy workforce.
2. Migration, while involving costs, can be a source of human capital formation if the enhanced earnings in the new location outweigh the costs of relocation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Investment in health directly impacts human capital. A healthy workforce is more productive, leading to higher economic output.  Preventive measures (like vaccination) and curative care (medical interventions) both contribute to a healthier, more productive population, thus enhancing human capital.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Migration, though involving costs (transport, living expenses, adjustment to a new environment), can lead to human capital formation if the increased income in the new location surpasses these costs.  This is especially true for skilled workers seeking better opportunities.  The increased earning potential contributes to national productivity and overall human capital development.  The costs are considered an investment, similar to education or training.


**2. With reference to the challenges of inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The persistent reliance on agriculture, despite its declining contribution to GDP, and the prevalence of disguised unemployment in the sector, hinder inclusive growth.
2.  Inadequate investment in rural infrastructure, including access to credit and markets, limits the potential for growth in the unorganized non-farm sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a major challenge.  A large portion of the Indian population depends on agriculture, but its contribution to GDP is relatively small.  Disguised unemployment (where more people work than are needed for optimal output) reduces overall productivity and wages, hindering inclusive growth.  This surplus labor isn't effectively utilized in other sectors, perpetuating economic inequality.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Lack of investment in rural infrastructure creates a bottleneck for inclusive growth.  The unorganized non-farm sector, which employs a large workforce, needs better access to credit, markets, and technology to expand and create more productive and higher-paying jobs. This underdevelopment prevents this sector from becoming a significant engine of economic growth and opportunity.


**3. With reference to poverty estimation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tendulkar Committee's poverty line, based on daily per capita expenditure, faced criticism for being unrealistically low, leading to the subsequent Rangarajan Committee's revision.
2.  The estimation of poverty using consumption expenditure as a proxy for income has been consistently praised for its accuracy and ability to capture the nuanced realities of poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Tendulkar Committee's poverty line was indeed criticized for underestimating the extent of poverty in India due to its low daily expenditure thresholds. This led to the government appointing the Rangarajan Committee to revise the methodology and raise the poverty line.  The low figures generated controversy and were seen as not reflecting the lived experiences of the poor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While consumption expenditure is used as a proxy for income in poverty estimation, it is far from perfect and has faced significant criticism. It doesn't fully capture the multidimensional aspects of poverty, such as access to healthcare, education, and other essential services.  It also struggles to account for non-monetary deprivations and the complexities of household income dynamics.  The methodology is subject to ongoing debate and refinement.


**4. With reference to government initiatives for skill development and entrepreneurship in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) aims to create an ecosystem that fosters innovation across various sectors by providing platforms for collaboration and awareness-building.
2.  The "Chunauti" contest specifically targets startups in Tier-I cities to provide seed funding and other support, aiming to boost the urban economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) is a flagship initiative designed to cultivate a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in India.  It works to create a supportive environment by providing resources, connecting stakeholders, and raising awareness about innovation opportunities across various economic sectors.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The "Chunauti" (challenge) contest, while designed to support startups, specifically focuses on Tier-II cities in India.  The aim is to promote entrepreneurship and economic development in areas beyond major metropolitan centers.  The focus on Tier-II cities is a key component of the initiative's strategy to achieve more inclusive growth.


**5. Consider the following statements about the state of infrastructure in India compared to other countries:**

1.  India's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP is significantly lower than that of countries like China and Indonesia, hindering its economic development.
2.  India has achieved near-universal access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation, indicating significant progress in its social infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Data consistently shows that India's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP is considerably lower than many other developing nations, including China and Indonesia. This underinvestment acts as a major constraint on economic growth and development, limiting productivity and competitiveness.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India has made progress, access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation, particularly in rural areas, remains far from universal.  A significant portion of the population lacks access to these basic necessities, highlighting the need for continued investment in social infrastructure.  The data presented in the text clearly refutes this statement.


**6. With reference to rural development in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Green Revolution, while increasing agricultural production, exacerbated regional disparities and inequalities between large and small farmers.
2.  The multi-agency approach to rural credit, involving commercial banks, regional rural banks, and cooperatives, has consistently proven highly effective in reaching all segments of the rural population with affordable credit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Green Revolution significantly increased agricultural output in certain regions, but it also led to greater disparities between regions and between large and small farmers.  Those with access to resources and technology benefited disproportionately, while many small farmers were left behind.  This uneven distribution of benefits contributed to increased inequality and social unrest in certain areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the multi-agency approach to rural credit aimed to provide more accessible and affordable credit, it has faced significant challenges.  High rates of loan defaults, inadequate reach to certain populations, and the persistence of informal credit sources illustrate the limitations of this system in effectively serving all segments of the rural population.  The system is not fully integrated and efficient.


**7. With reference to the impact of economic reforms in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms led to a significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign exchange reserves, indicating increased integration into the global economy.
2. The reform-led growth has consistently generated sufficient employment opportunities to absorb the growing workforce and reduce unemployment rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Economic reforms in India did result in a substantial increase in FDI and foreign exchange reserves.  This inflow of foreign capital reflects a greater integration into the global economy and increased confidence in the Indian market.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While economic reforms led to higher GDP growth, they haven't consistently generated sufficient employment opportunities to keep pace with the expanding workforce.  The increase in employment hasn't matched the rate of economic growth, leading to concerns about job creation and unemployment, particularly among the less skilled.  The quality of jobs created has also been a major concern.


**1. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Investment in health, including preventive and curative medicine, significantly contributes to human capital formation by increasing the supply of a healthy labor force.
2.  Migration, while involving costs, can be a source of human capital formation if the increased earnings in the new location outweigh the migration costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of human capital formation in India.  Statement 1 correctly identifies investment in health as a crucial component.  A healthy workforce is more productive, leading to higher economic output.  Preventive measures (like vaccination) and curative care (medical intervention) directly impact labor supply and productivity.  The text explicitly mentions this link between health expenditure and human capital formation.

Statement 2 also holds true.  While migration involves costs (transportation, higher living expenses, adjusting to a new environment), the potential for higher salaries in a new location can outweigh these costs.  This increased earning potential contributes to human capital formation by improving the individual's economic well-being and potentially leading to greater investment in education and skills development. The passage directly supports this by mentioning migration as a source, highlighting the trade-off between costs and enhanced earnings.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**2. With reference to government initiatives in poverty alleviation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Growth-oriented approaches, focusing solely on increasing GDP and per capita income, have historically proven effective in significantly reducing poverty in India.
2.  Specific poverty alleviation programs, aimed at generating incremental assets and employment for the poor, have been implemented since the Third Five-Year Plan, with varying degrees of success.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While economic growth is a necessary condition for poverty reduction, relying solely on growth-oriented approaches without addressing income inequality and access to resources has not proven consistently effective in India. The passage explicitly states that the benefits of economic growth have not always trickled down to the poor, and that the gap between rich and poor has widened.  The Green Revolution, while boosting agricultural output, also exacerbated regional and socioeconomic disparities.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage details the shift towards specific poverty alleviation programs starting from the Third Five-Year Plan.  These programs focused on asset creation and employment generation, representing a move beyond relying solely on generalized economic growth.  While the text notes challenges and varying degrees of success in their implementation, the existence and evolution of such programs are clearly documented.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMFBY provides full insurance cover for crops, with no capping on the sum insured, regardless of the type of crop or the specific risk.
2. PMFBY utilizes technology such as drones and low-cost satellites for efficient crop damage assessment and claim settlement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While PMFBY aims to provide comprehensive insurance,  it doesn't offer unlimited coverage for all risks. There are specific perils covered, and post-harvest losses are covered only under certain conditions (up to two weeks post-harvest for specific crops and events). The text explicitly mentions limitations on post-harvest loss coverage.  The statement oversimplifies the scheme's coverage.

Statement 2 is correct. The scheme explicitly utilizes and promotes the use of technology like drones and low-cost satellites for efficient assessment of crop damage, enabling faster and more cost-effective claim settlements.  The passage directly mentions the use of these technologies to improve the accuracy and speed of claims processing.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding subsidies in India:**

1.  Price subsidies, while intending to benefit the poor, often lead to regressive outcomes where wealthier households receive a disproportionately larger share of the subsidy.
2.  Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) aims to improve the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs by reducing leakages and administrative costs associated with traditional price subsidies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage clearly explains that price subsidies can be regressive.  Wealthier households often consume more of the subsidized goods or services (electricity, water, LPG) than poorer households, thus receiving a greater benefit from the subsidy.  This is a well-documented criticism of price subsidy schemes.

Statement 2 is also correct. DBT is presented as a mechanism to address the inefficiencies and leakages associated with traditional price subsidies. By directly transferring cash to beneficiaries, it reduces the involvement of intermediaries and the potential for diversion of funds, leading to increased efficiency and reduced administrative costs.  The passage highlights the cost savings achieved through DBT in the LPG subsidy program.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy's fiscal policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Review Committee recommended a specific debt-to-GDP ratio target for the combined central and state governments by a certain year.
2.  The Constitution of India mandates that a state government must obtain the central government's consent for raising any loan if it has outstanding liabilities to the latter.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FRBM Review Committee did indeed recommend a debt-to-GDP ratio target for the combined central and state governments. The passage mentions this recommendation, including a specific percentage and target year.  The exact figures and timeframe are mentioned in the source material.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While there are constitutional provisions regarding state borrowing, the statement is too strong. The passage doesn't state that it's mandatory for a state to get central government consent *in all cases* if it has outstanding liabilities.  The constitutional provisions related to state borrowing are more nuanced and not fully described in the provided text.


**6. With reference to the challenges faced by the Indian government in public expenditure management, consider the following statements:**

1.  Inadequate allocation of funds for social protection and social inclusion schemes often hinders effective poverty reduction.
2.  The implementation of central sector schemes, which are 100% funded by the central government, is always free from inefficiencies and leakages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage highlights the challenge of insufficient funding for core social protection and inclusion schemes.  This inadequate funding directly impacts the government's ability to effectively address poverty and social inequality. The text emphasizes the need for prioritizing these schemes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While central sector schemes are fully funded by the central government, they are not immune to inefficiencies and leakages. The passage does not make such a claim, and in fact, the overall context suggests that inefficiencies can occur in various government schemes regardless of funding source.  The statement presents an overly optimistic and unrealistic view of government implementation.


**7.  With reference to the features of Value Added Tax (VAT), consider the following statements:**

1.  VAT is a multi-point destination-based tax system, levied on the value added at each stage of a transaction in the production-distribution chain.
2.  The implementation of VAT is solely the responsibility of the central government; state governments play only a facilitating role.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. VAT is indeed a multi-point destination-based tax system. The tax is levied on the value added at each stage of the production and distribution chain, with the final consumer bearing the burden.  The passage accurately describes this aspect of VAT.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage does not support the claim that the implementation of VAT rests solely with the central government. The actual implementation and administration of VAT involve both central and state governments, reflecting the federal structure of India's tax system.  The statement misrepresents the division of responsibilities.


**8. With reference to the characteristics of Public Goods, consider the following statements:**

1. Public goods are non-rivalrous, meaning that one person's consumption of the good does not diminish the availability of the good for others.
2. Public goods are non-excludable, making it impossible to prevent individuals from consuming the good, even if they do not pay for it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately define key characteristics of public goods.  Non-rivalry means that multiple individuals can consume the good simultaneously without diminishing its availability for others (e.g., national defense, clean air).  Non-excludability means that it's difficult or impossible to prevent anyone from benefiting from the good, regardless of whether they paid for it (e.g., street lighting, public parks). The passage clearly defines these two characteristics as defining features of public goods.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**9. With reference to the sources of growth in farmers' income, consider the following statements:**

1.  Improvement in crop productivity is a major source of growth within the agricultural sector, as the productivity of many crops in India remains low.
2.  Growth in agricultural output always translates into a proportionate growth in farmers’ income, making increased agricultural production a sufficient condition for doubling farmers’ income.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that improving crop productivity is a key strategy for boosting farmers' incomes, highlighting the low productivity levels of many crops in India.  This is a widely acknowledged challenge in Indian agriculture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage directly contradicts this.  It points out that growth in agricultural output doesn't automatically lead to proportionate growth in farmers' income due to factors like price fluctuations.  Therefore, increased agricultural production alone is not sufficient to guarantee a doubling of farmers' income; other factors like market prices and access to markets are crucial.


**10. With reference to the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF), consider the following statements:**

1. AHIDF provides 100% funding for the establishment of dairy and meat processing infrastructure and animal feed plants in the private sector.
2. Eligible beneficiaries under AHIDF include FPOs, MSMEs, and individual entrepreneurs, with a mandatory minimum contribution of margin money from the beneficiary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  AHIDF does *not* provide 100% funding. The passage clearly states that beneficiaries are required to contribute a minimum of 10% margin money, with the remaining 90% provided as a loan from scheduled banks. The statement misrepresents the funding mechanism.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage lists FPOs, MSMEs, and individual entrepreneurs as eligible beneficiaries, and it explicitly mentions the requirement for a minimum 10% margin money contribution from the beneficiary.  The statement accurately reflects the eligibility criteria and funding requirements of AHIDF.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on polity and governance aspects related to economic development and poverty alleviation in India.  The questions are designed to be challenging, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring in-depth knowledge.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's approach to poverty reduction:**

1. The initial growth-oriented approach, prevalent in the 1950s and early 1960s, primarily focused on trickle-down economics, anticipating that rapid GDP growth would automatically benefit the poor.
2. Subsequent approaches shifted towards targeted poverty alleviation programs, aiming to directly improve the income and employment prospects of the poor through asset creation and work generation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the initial strategy of focusing on overall economic growth to alleviate poverty. The belief was that the benefits of industrialization and agricultural advancements (like the Green Revolution) would eventually reach the poorest segments of society.  However, this approach proved inadequate, failing to address the persistent income inequality and regional disparities.

Statement 2 correctly describes the evolution of poverty alleviation strategies. Recognizing the limitations of the trickle-down approach, subsequent five-year plans and government initiatives emphasized targeted interventions. These included programs aimed at creating employment opportunities (like the Food for Work program), generating self-employment (like PMRY and SGSY), and providing minimum basic amenities (like the Public Distribution System).  These programs aimed at directly addressing the needs of the poor, rather than relying solely on overall economic growth.


**2. With reference to the challenges of inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The persistent dependence of a significant portion of the population on agriculture, despite its relatively low contribution to GDP, points to issues of low productivity and disguised unemployment in the sector.
2.  Regional disparities, exemplified by significant differences in per capita income between states like Punjab and Bihar, highlight the uneven distribution of the benefits of economic growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately highlights a key challenge to inclusive growth.  While agriculture employs a large section of India's population (around 43% according to the text), its contribution to GDP is significantly lower (16%). This disparity indicates low productivity and the presence of disguised unemployment, where more people are employed in the sector than are economically necessary. This prevents the sector from acting as a significant engine of economic growth and income generation for a large portion of the population.

Statement 2 correctly points to regional disparities as a significant obstacle to inclusive growth.  The vast differences in per capita income between different states illustrate the uneven distribution of economic opportunities and benefits.  Such disparities can lead to social unrest and hinder overall national development.  Addressing these regional imbalances is crucial for achieving inclusive growth.


**3. With reference to poverty estimation methodologies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Tendulkar Committee's poverty line, based on consumption expenditure data, faced criticism for underestimating the extent of poverty due to its relatively low thresholds.
2. The Rangarajan Committee revised the poverty line upwards, resulting in a higher percentage of the population being classified as below the poverty line (BPL) compared to the Tendulkar Committee's estimates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tendulkar Committee's poverty line, while using consumption expenditure data, was criticized for employing thresholds that many believed were too low to accurately reflect the minimum needs for a decent standard of living.  This led to significant underestimation of the extent of poverty in India, sparking considerable debate and criticism.

Statement 2 is also correct. In response to the criticism levelled against the Tendulkar Committee's estimates, the Rangarajan Committee revised the poverty line upwards. This resulted in a higher percentage of the Indian population being classified as living below the poverty line compared to the previous estimates.  The Rangarajan Committee's higher thresholds reflected a more comprehensive understanding of the cost of living and minimum needs.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding infrastructure's role in economic development:**

1.  Adequate infrastructure, encompassing transportation, communication, and energy, is crucial for efficient agricultural production, facilitating the timely movement of inputs (seeds, fertilizers) and outputs (produce).
2.  Inadequate infrastructure can negatively impact health outcomes, limiting access to healthcare facilities and contributing to higher morbidity rates from waterborne diseases due to poor sanitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the critical role of infrastructure in modern agriculture. Efficient transportation networks are essential for the timely delivery of inputs and the quick movement of produce to markets, minimizing losses and maximizing productivity.  Poor infrastructure in these areas directly impacts agricultural output and the income of farmers.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the link between infrastructure and health.  Access to healthcare services is directly affected by the quality of transportation infrastructure.  Furthermore, the lack of adequate water supply and sanitation systems, a critical component of infrastructure, leads to higher rates of waterborne diseases, increasing morbidity and impacting overall public health.


**5. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Investments in education and health, though generating both private and social benefits, necessitate government intervention due to the long-term nature of their impact and information asymmetry in the market.
2. The significant variations in per capita education expenditure across Indian states result in disparities in educational attainment and opportunities, emphasizing the need for more equitable resource allocation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the rationale for government intervention in education and healthcare.  These sectors are characterized by long-term investments whose effects are not immediately apparent, making private sector involvement alone insufficient.  Moreover, information asymmetry—where consumers lack complete information about the quality and cost of services—can lead to market failures.  Government regulation and funding are therefore necessary to ensure quality and equitable access.

Statement 2 accurately points to the issue of inter-state disparities in education expenditure and its impact on educational outcomes.  The wide variation in per capita expenditure reflects unequal access to educational resources, leading to differences in literacy rates and overall educational attainment across states. This highlights the need for policies aimed at ensuring more equitable distribution of educational resources across the country.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding employment in India:**

1. The growth of the service sector, while creating new jobs, has predominantly resulted in informal employment with limited social security benefits.
2. Disguised unemployment, a characteristic of rural areas, refers to a situation where the marginal productivity of labor is zero or near zero.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a significant trend in India's employment landscape.  The expansion of the service sector has indeed generated employment, but a large proportion of these jobs are in the informal sector, lacking formal contracts, social security benefits, and often characterized by low wages and poor working conditions.  This contrasts with the formal sector, which offers better employment security and benefits.

Statement 2 correctly defines disguised unemployment.  This type of unemployment is prevalent in sectors like agriculture where more people are employed than are actually needed for optimal production.  The marginal productivity of additional labor is essentially zero, meaning that removing some workers would not affect the total output.


**7. With reference to India's economic policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deficit financing, involving the creation of new money to finance government spending, can be inflationary in its effect, increasing the money supply without a corresponding increase in output.
2.  Reducing the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) can potentially lead commercial banks to cut their lending rates, stimulating investment and economic activity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the potential inflationary consequences of deficit financing. When the government finances its budget deficit by creating new money (rather than borrowing), it increases the money supply in the economy. If this increase in money supply is not matched by a corresponding increase in the production of goods and services, it can lead to inflation as more money chases the same amount of goods.

Statement 2 is also correct. The SLR is the percentage of deposits that commercial banks are required to maintain as liquid assets with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  A reduction in the SLR frees up funds for commercial banks, enabling them to lend more. This increased lending capacity can lead to lower interest rates, making borrowing cheaper for businesses and individuals, thereby stimulating investment and economic activity.  However, this also carries the risk of increased inflation if not managed carefully.


**8. Consider the following statements related to the Indian economy:**

1. An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates a depreciation of the Indian Rupee.
2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates a deterioration in India's trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  An increase in NEER actually indicates an *appreciation* of the domestic currency (Rupee) against a basket of other currencies.  NEER measures the value of the Rupee relative to other currencies, considering the weights of each currency in international trade.  A higher NEER suggests that the Rupee has strengthened.

Statement 2 is correct. An increase in REER implies a *worsening* of a country's trade competitiveness.  REER adjusts NEER for inflation differentials between the domestic economy and other economies.  A higher REER suggests that the country's goods and services have become relatively more expensive compared to those of its trading partners, making them less competitive in the international market.


**9. With reference to the concept of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of a standardized basket of goods and services in different countries, adjusting for differences in purchasing power.
2.  India's ranking as the sixth-largest economy in the world, when measured in terms of PPP dollars, reflects a higher purchasing power for the Rupee compared to its nominal exchange rate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PPP exchange rates provide a more accurate comparison of economic size across countries by accounting for differences in the cost of living.  They are calculated by comparing the prices of a common basket of goods and services in different countries, adjusting for purchasing power.  This contrasts with nominal exchange rates, which only reflect the market exchange rates between currencies.

Statement 2 is also correct.  When measured using nominal exchange rates, India's economy appears smaller than when measured using PPP exchange rates. This is because the PPP approach takes into account the lower cost of goods and services in India compared to many other countries, thus reflecting a higher purchasing power for the Rupee.  This results in a higher ranking for India's economy when measured in PPP terms.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding factors affecting market demand:**

1. An increase in the price of a substitute good will lead to an increase in the demand for the original good, *ceteris paribus*.
2.  A decrease in the price of a complementary good will lead to an increase in the demand for the original good, *ceteris paribus*.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of one another.  If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper original good, leading to an increase in its demand.

Statement 2 is also correct. Complementary goods are those that are consumed together. If the price of a complementary good decreases, it becomes more affordable to consume both goods together, resulting in an increased demand for the original good as well.  The lower price of the complementary good increases the overall desirability and consumption of the original good.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a higher difficulty level by incorporating subtle inaccuracies and plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Investment in health, encompassing preventive, curative, and social medicine, significantly contributes to human capital formation by increasing the supply of a healthy workforce.
2.  Migration, while involving costs like transportation and adjustment to new environments, ultimately enhances human capital formation due to increased earnings outweighing migration costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of human capital formation in India. Statement 1 correctly identifies investments in various aspects of healthcare as crucial for a productive workforce.  A healthy population translates directly into higher labor productivity and economic output. The inclusion of preventive, curative, and social medicine demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of healthcare's role in human capital development.

Statement 2 accurately describes the role of migration. While migration involves costs (financial, social, and psychological), the potential for higher earnings in new locations makes it a net positive contributor to human capital.  Individuals often migrate to access better job opportunities and higher wages, leading to an overall increase in their human capital and contribution to the economy.  The statement acknowledges the costs but correctly highlights the overall positive impact on human capital.



**2. With reference to subsidies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Price subsidies, while offering short-term relief from inflation, often prove regressive as wealthier households disproportionately benefit due to higher consumption levels of subsidized goods.
2.  Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mechanisms, although efficient in reducing leakages and enhancing program effectiveness, can still be regressive if not carefully targeted towards the most vulnerable sections of the population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly highlight crucial aspects of subsidy programs in India.  Statement 1 accurately points out the regressive nature of many price subsidies.  Because wealthier households consume more of the subsidized goods (electricity, water, LPG), they receive a larger share of the subsidy, exacerbating income inequality.  This is a well-documented issue in the economics of development and public policy.

Statement 2 correctly notes that while DBT mechanisms are superior to price subsidies in terms of efficiency and reducing leakages, they can still be regressive if not carefully targeted.  If the criteria for DBT eligibility are not stringent enough, wealthier individuals may still receive the benefits, undermining the intended goal of poverty alleviation.  The statement correctly balances the advantages of DBT with the potential for regressive outcomes if not properly implemented.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMFBY offers a fixed premium rate for each season across all food grains, oilseeds, and pulses, irrespective of crop type or location, thereby promoting equitable access to insurance.
2.  PMFBY's coverage encompasses pre-sowing risks, standing crop risks, and post-harvest losses due to specified perils, showcasing a comprehensive approach to crop insurance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements reflect key features of the PMFBY. Statement 1 is largely correct in that it aims for a simplified, uniform premium structure across major crops within a season.  While there might be some minor variations in practice, the core principle is to standardize premiums for better accessibility and equity.

Statement 2 is also correct. PMFBY's coverage explicitly includes risks at various stages of crop production, from pre-sowing to post-harvest, covering a wide range of perils. This comprehensive approach is a significant improvement over previous crop insurance schemes and is a key element of the scheme's design.


**4. With reference to the challenges in Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The historical focus on agricultural output (tonnage) rather than farmer income has often resulted in policies that increase production without necessarily improving farmers’ welfare.
2.  The Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, while intending to protect farmers from price fluctuations, can lead to market distortions and under-cultivation of non-MSP crops, affecting food price stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe significant challenges in Indian agriculture. Statement 1 highlights the critical issue of prioritizing output over farmer income.  Policies focused solely on increasing agricultural production without considering market prices or farmer profitability have often failed to improve the economic conditions of farmers, leading to distress.

Statement 2 correctly points out the unintended consequences of the MSP system.  By guaranteeing procurement prices for certain crops, the MSP system can incentivize farmers to focus on those crops while neglecting the cultivation of other essential crops, creating supply-demand imbalances and contributing to price volatility in the non-MSP sector.


**5. With reference to the role of the government in rural development, consider the following statements:**

1.  The establishment of Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs), subsidized by the government, aims to address the issue of unequal access to modern agricultural machinery among small and marginal farmers.
2.  The National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology (NMAET) integrates extension services with technology dissemination to improve agricultural productivity and practices, linking four sub-missions for comprehensive impact.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe the government's role in rural development. Statement 1 accurately describes the purpose of CHCs.  By providing subsidies for the establishment of these centers, the government aims to make modern agricultural equipment accessible to small and marginal farmers who cannot afford to purchase such machinery individually.  This promotes greater efficiency and productivity in agriculture.

Statement 2 correctly explains the integrated approach of NMAET. The four sub-missions (Agricultural Extension, Seed and Planting Material, Agricultural Mechanization, and Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine) are designed to work together to improve various aspects of agricultural technology and productivity. The integrated nature of the mission ensures a comprehensive and coordinated approach to rural development.


**6.  With reference to poverty alleviation programs in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) aims to provide guaranteed wage employment for a minimum of 100 days in a year to every household willing to undertake unskilled manual work, thereby addressing both unemployment and poverty.
2.  While various self-employment schemes have evolved over time, incorporating the formation of self-help groups (SHGs), their effectiveness in poverty alleviation is often hampered by issues like unequal asset distribution and resource appropriation by non-poor groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe aspects of poverty alleviation programs. Statement 1 accurately describes the core objective of NREGA – providing guaranteed wage employment to rural households, thereby addressing both unemployment and poverty. The 100-day employment guarantee is a key feature of the act.

Statement 2 correctly points out the limitations of self-employment schemes. Despite the positive intent and the incorporation of SHGs to improve access to credit and resources, challenges such as unequal asset distribution and resource capture by non-poor groups often limit their effectiveness in actually alleviating poverty among the most vulnerable.  This highlights the complex socio-economic factors that influence the success of such programs.


**7. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The share of agriculture in India's GDP has consistently decreased over the past few decades, reflecting a structural shift towards a more service-oriented economy.
2.  While economic growth has historically benefited the poor, the extent of this benefit is often debated, with concerns remaining about unequal distribution of income and assets leading to persistent poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate reflections of the Indian economy's trajectory.  Statement 1 correctly points out the declining share of agriculture in GDP.  This is a well-established trend, indicating a structural transformation of the Indian economy away from an agrarian base towards a greater reliance on services and industry.

Statement 2 correctly states that economic growth does not automatically translate into poverty reduction. While growth can improve overall living standards, the benefits are not always evenly distributed.  Inequality in income and asset distribution often means that the poorest segments of society do not benefit proportionally from economic expansion, leading to persistent poverty.  This is a key concern in development economics.



**8. With reference to infrastructure development in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The significant investment in infrastructure, especially in sectors like irrigation, transportation, and power, has been a major driver of agricultural and industrial progress in states like Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Gujarat.
2.  Despite progress in certain sectors and regions, challenges remain in providing access to basic infrastructure like electricity, safe drinking water, and sanitation in rural areas, especially when compared to other developing nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the state of infrastructure development in India. Statement 1 correctly identifies the correlation between infrastructure development and economic progress in specific states.  The availability of irrigation, transportation, and power facilities has played a crucial role in the agricultural and industrial success of these states.

Statement 2 is also correct in pointing out the persistent challenges in rural infrastructure.  Despite considerable efforts, many rural areas lack access to basic amenities like electricity, safe drinking water, and sanitation.  This disparity is often highlighted in comparison with other developing nations that have made more significant progress in providing these essential services.  The statement accurately reflects the continued need for investment and improvement in rural infrastructure.


**1. With reference to the methodologies employed in poverty estimation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dandekar-Rath Committee's approach focused primarily on monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) using a mixed reference period.
2. The Tendulkar Committee's poverty line calculations were revised by the Rangarajan Committee, leading to a higher poverty estimate.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Dandekar-Rath Committee did contribute significantly to the study of poverty in India, their methodology didn't solely rely on MPCE with a mixed reference period.  Their work involved a more comprehensive approach to understanding poverty, including considerations beyond just consumption expenditure. The computation of poverty in terms of MPCE based on the Mixed Reference Period was recommended by the Tendulkar Committee.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Tendulkar Committee's poverty line estimations, based on consumption expenditure data, were indeed subsequently revised by the Rangarajan Committee. The Rangarajan Committee adjusted the poverty line upwards, resulting in a higher percentage of the population being classified as below the poverty line (BPL) compared to the Tendulkar Committee's figures. This revision reflected changes in consumption patterns and cost of living.  The differing methodologies and resulting poverty estimates highlight the complexities and ongoing debates surrounding poverty measurement in India.  The choice of methodology significantly impacts the outcome, making it a crucial area of discussion in policy formulation.


**2. With reference to the National Skill Development Mission (NSDM), consider the following statements:**

1. Overseas employment is a primary submission of the NSDM, aiming to facilitate the placement of skilled Indian workers abroad.
2.  The NSDM's submissions include leveraging public infrastructure for skill development initiatives, utilizing existing facilities to enhance training capabilities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NSDM indirectly contributes to overseas employment by improving the skills of Indian workers, it is not a primary or explicit focus of the mission. The NSDM's emphasis is on domestic skill development and workforce enhancement within India.  Other government programs specifically target international employment opportunities.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NSDM explicitly aims to utilize and leverage existing public infrastructure to support its skill development programs. This efficient utilization of resources is a key element of the NSDM's strategy. This includes utilizing existing government-owned facilities and training centers to expand the reach and effectiveness of skill development initiatives.  This approach reflects a pragmatic approach to optimizing resource allocation and maximizing impact.


**3. With reference to the POSHAN Abhiyaan, consider the following statements:**

1. The POSHAN Abhiyaan focuses solely on direct nutritional interventions, providing supplementary foods and micronutrients to malnourished children.
2.  Inter-sectoral convergence is a key strategy of the POSHAN Abhiyaan, coordinating efforts across various government ministries and departments to ensure comprehensive service delivery.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The POSHAN Abhiyaan is a comprehensive program addressing malnutrition, but it does not limit itself to direct nutritional supplements.  Its approach is holistic, involving various strategies to improve nutrition and health outcomes.  The program recognizes that malnutrition is a complex issue influenced by multiple factors beyond just food availability.

Statement 2 is correct.  Inter-sectoral convergence is a central pillar of the POSHAN Abhiyaan's strategy.  The program recognizes that addressing malnutrition requires coordinated efforts across various government departments and ministries. This collaborative approach facilitates efficient resource allocation, improved service delivery, and a more comprehensive impact on nutritional status. The integrated approach ensures that various related services, such as healthcare, sanitation, and education, work in synergy towards a common goal.


**4. With reference to the National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The MPI solely relies on income-based measures to assess poverty, reflecting the traditional economic definition of poverty.
2.  The MPI incorporates indicators related to health and education, providing a multidimensional perspective on poverty that goes beyond income.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MPI fundamentally departs from a purely income-based approach to poverty measurement. It recognizes that poverty is a complex phenomenon encompassing various dimensions beyond just income.  The MPI uses a multidimensional approach to capture the multifaceted nature of poverty.

Statement 2 is correct.  The MPI explicitly incorporates indicators related to health and education, reflecting its multidimensional approach.  These indicators provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of poverty, capturing deprivations in essential aspects of human well-being that are not fully reflected in income alone.  The inclusion of health and education indicators aligns with the broader concept of human development, which emphasizes capabilities and opportunities.


**5. With reference to types of unemployment, consider the following statements:**

1. Frictional unemployment is a short-term type of unemployment that arises due to the time taken to match workers with suitable jobs.
2.  Structural unemployment is a long-term type of unemployment that occurs due to a mismatch between the skills possessed by workers and the skills demanded by employers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Frictional unemployment is a natural and short-term form of unemployment that occurs even in a healthy economy. It represents the time lag between workers leaving one job and finding another. This type of unemployment is often considered unavoidable and is generally of short duration.

Statement 2 is correct. Structural unemployment is a more persistent and severe form of unemployment. It arises from a fundamental mismatch between the skills and qualifications of the workforce and the available job opportunities.  This mismatch can be due to technological advancements, changes in industry structure, or geographical imbalances in job creation.  Addressing structural unemployment often requires long-term strategies, such as retraining programs and investments in education and skills development.


**6. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY), consider the following statements:**

1. The PMSSY aims to establish new medical colleges and upgrade existing ones to enhance the quality of medical education in the country.
2.  The PMSSY's objective is to provide universal access to free healthcare services across India, eliminating out-of-pocket expenses for all citizens.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

The provision of healthcare services remains a complex issue involving various public and private initiatives.


**7. With reference to the formulation of the concept of poverty as a measurable development indicator, consider the following statements:**

1. Dadabhai Naoroji's work on poverty in India focused primarily on the use of quantitative data and statistical analysis.
2.  V.K.R.V. Rao's contributions to poverty measurement involved developing sophisticated econometric models to analyze income distribution.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dadabhai Naoroji's pioneering work on poverty in India is recognized for its early attempts at quantifying poverty, albeit with limitations in data availability at that time. His analysis, while not utilizing sophisticated econometric models, laid the groundwork for future quantitative studies on poverty in India.  His work highlighted the drain of wealth from India under British rule, contributing to the understanding of the economic dimensions of poverty.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While V.K.R.V. Rao made significant contributions to Indian economics and development, his work on poverty measurement did not primarily involve developing sophisticated econometric models in the same way that later studies have. His contributions were more focused on broader policy implications and social aspects of poverty.  His emphasis was on the multi-faceted nature of poverty, going beyond income-based metrics.


**8. With reference to the challenges of inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The agricultural sector's low contribution to GDP, despite a large proportion of the population being dependent on it, indicates a need for structural reforms.
2. Regional disparities in income and development levels across states in India are insignificant and have minimal impact on overall growth.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The significant disparity between the agricultural sector's contribution to GDP and its workforce highlights a major challenge for inclusive growth. This suggests a need for reforms to improve productivity and incomes within the agricultural sector, making it a more effective contributor to national economic growth and reducing the dependence on it.  This low productivity contributes to rural poverty and limits the overall economic potential of the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Regional disparities in income and development levels are a significant concern for inclusive growth in India.  These disparities create imbalances in opportunities and resources across different states, hindering the equitable distribution of the benefits of growth.  Addressing these regional disparities is crucial for fostering inclusive growth and ensuring that the benefits of economic progress reach all parts of the country.  Significant differences in per capita income between states like Punjab and Bihar highlight this issue.


**9. With reference to government initiatives aimed at promoting inclusive growth, consider the following statements:**

1.  MGNREGA primarily focuses on providing skilled employment opportunities in urban areas, enhancing the skillsets of the urban poor.
2. Aadhaar's primary objective is to create a unique digital identity for each citizen, facilitating access to government services and welfare programs.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is primarily focused on providing guaranteed unskilled manual wage employment in rural areas.  It aims to address rural unemployment and poverty by offering work to those who need it, particularly in the agricultural sector.  It does not directly focus on urban areas or skilled employment.

Statement 2 is correct. The Aadhaar program's core objective is to create a unique biometric digital identity for every Indian citizen. This digital identity serves as a crucial tool for efficient delivery of government services and welfare programs, ensuring that benefits reach the intended beneficiaries without duplication or leakage.  It plays a significant role in enhancing transparency and reducing corruption in welfare schemes.


**10. With reference to the concept of human capital formation, consider the following statements:**

1. Investment in health is a significant source of human capital formation, contributing to increased productivity and reduced healthcare costs.
2. On-the-job training provided by firms is not considered a form of investment in human capital because it primarily benefits the firms, not the workers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Investment in health is a crucial component of human capital formation.  A healthy workforce is more productive, leading to higher economic output.  Improved health also reduces healthcare costs associated with lost productivity due to illness.  This investment in health translates into long-term benefits for both individuals and the economy as a whole.

Statement 2 is incorrect. On-the-job training is definitely considered a form of investment in human capital. While firms benefit from increased worker productivity, the workers themselves also gain valuable skills and increased earning potential. This enhanced skillset increases their employability and market value.  Therefore, on-the-job training represents a mutually beneficial investment in human capital, improving both individual and firm outcomes.


**11. With reference to the state of infrastructure in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP is significantly higher than that of many other developing countries, indicating a strong commitment to infrastructure development.
2.  Inadequate infrastructure in areas such as transportation and communication can hinder economic growth and development by increasing transaction costs and limiting market access.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP is comparatively lower than many other developing countries, highlighting a significant gap in infrastructure development. This underinvestment acts as a constraint on economic growth and development.  The lower investment compared to countries like China and Indonesia reflects a need for increased public and private investment in infrastructure.

Statement 2 is correct.  Inadequate infrastructure significantly hampers economic growth.  Poor transportation and communication networks increase transaction costs, making it more expensive to move goods and services.  This limited market access restricts economic opportunities, particularly for businesses in rural areas or remote regions.  Improving infrastructure is crucial for enhancing connectivity, reducing costs, and fostering greater economic participation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Swaniyojan Yojana is designed to promote entrepreneurship and self-employment specifically in rural areas.  It is not focused on urban areas or urban youth.  The program aims to provide support to rural entrepreneurs to establish and grow their businesses.

Statement 2 is correct. This scheme directly targets rural entrepreneurs, aiming to provide them with the necessary resources to start and manage their own businesses.  The program offers financial assistance, training, and other support mechanisms to facilitate self-employment opportunities in rural communities and contribute to rural development.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Startups are indeed included under the Priority Sector Lending (PSL) rules of the RBI. This inclusion makes it easier for startups to access credit from banks, which is crucial for their growth and development.  The PSL classification provides favorable terms and conditions for loans to startups, thereby supporting their financial needs.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian government offers tax holidays to eligible startups for a specific period, usually three years out of the first ten years of operation.  This tax incentive aims to encourage entrepreneurship and reduce the financial burden on new businesses, promoting growth in the startup ecosystem.  This tax benefit is a significant incentive for entrepreneurs.

1. NSWS is designed to streamline the process of obtaining approvals and licenses from various government agencies, reducing bureaucratic hurdles for investors.
2. NSWS is a physical, centralized office where investors can submit all their applications and receive approvals, eliminating the need for online interactions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NSWS is a digital platform designed to simplify the process of obtaining various approvals and licenses from different government agencies.  It aims to reduce bureaucratic delays, improve transparency, and make it easier for investors to start and operate businesses in India.  This simplification is intended to improve the ease of doing business in India.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While large corporations have benefited from e-commerce, it has also had a significant positive impact on MSMEs.  E-commerce platforms provide MSMEs with opportunities to reach a wider customer base, overcoming geographical limitations and reducing reliance on traditional distribution channels.  This increased market access has empowered many MSMEs to grow their businesses.

Statement 2 is correct. E-commerce has created a level playing field for MSMEs, allowing them to compete with larger businesses on a national and even international scale.  The reduced cost of marketing and advertising through online platforms has also made it easier for MSMEs to promote their products and services.  This access to wider markets has been a significant catalyst for the growth of the MSME sector in India.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  In India during 1999-2000, the primary sector was the leading source of employment for a significant majority of the workforce.
2.  The service sector's contribution to employment in urban India during 1999-2000 significantly exceeded its contribution in rural India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Table 7.2 in the provided text clearly shows that in 1999-2000, the primary sector (Agriculture and Mining and Quarrying) employed 60.4% of the total workforce, while the secondary (15.8%) and tertiary (23.8%) sectors had considerably lower shares.  This indicates the primary sector's dominance in employment.

Statement 2 is also correct. Table 7.2 reveals that the service sector contributed 23.8% to the total workforce, but in urban areas, this contribution was significantly higher at 23.8%. The rural workforce employed in the service sector during 1999-2000 constituted only 13.1%, a substantial difference from urban employment in the service sector. This highlights the disproportionate concentration of service-sector jobs in urban areas compared to rural areas. The data supports the assertion that the service sector's employment contribution was much larger in urban areas.


**2. With reference to the distribution of workforce in India (1999-2000), consider the following statements:**

1.  More than three-fourths of the female workforce was employed in the primary sector.
2.  The secondary and service sectors offered more employment opportunities to men than to women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that "More than three-fourth of the female workforce is employed in the primary sector." This indicates a significant concentration of women in primary sector jobs.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage notes that while both men and women were concentrated in the primary sector, men had greater opportunities in the secondary and service sectors.  This implies a gender disparity in employment across the sectors, with men having a greater share of jobs in secondary and tertiary sectors.  The disproportionate access to secondary and service sector jobs for men compared to women is evident.


**3. With reference to the growth of employment and GDP in India (1960-2000), consider the following statements:**

1.  Employment growth exhibited consistent stability, maintaining an average rate of approximately 2%.
2.  The growth rate of GDP consistently outpaced the growth rate of employment throughout the period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that during the period 1960-2000, "employment grew at a stable rate of about 2 percent". This signifies a consistent growth pattern in employment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the text states that GDP growth was higher than employment growth, it also points out fluctuations in GDP growth. The statement implies a consistent superiority of GDP growth over employment growth, which is not entirely accurate based on the provided information. The passage does not conclusively support the idea of *consistent* outpacing of employment growth by GDP growth;  fluctuations in GDP growth are acknowledged.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the casualisation of the workforce in India (1972-2000):**

1.  The proportion of casual wage laborers increased significantly over the three decades.
2.  This casualisation resulted in improved quality of employment for a large segment of the workforce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text highlights the increase in the proportion of casual wage laborers from 23.2% in 1972-73 to 32.8% in 1999-2000 (Table 7.3). This clearly demonstrates a substantial rise in casual labor over the period.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that the process of moving from self-employment and regular salaried employment to casual wage work is referred to as "casualisation of workforce," and that this process "makes the workers highly vulnerable."  This directly contradicts the assertion of improved employment quality.  The increased casualization is linked to worker vulnerability, not improved employment quality.



**5. With reference to the Indian workforce in 1999-2000, consider the following statements:**

1.  The worker-population ratio was higher in rural areas than in urban areas.
2.  The participation rate of women in economic activities was significantly lower than that of men, particularly in urban areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Table 7.1 shows that the worker-population ratio was 41.7 for rural areas and 33.7 for urban areas.  This indicates a higher proportion of the population actively participating in economic activities in rural areas.

Statement 2 is also correct. Table 7.1 and the accompanying text clearly show that the worker-population ratio for men was substantially higher than that for women, especially in urban areas (51.8 for men versus 13.9 for women). This points to a significant gender gap in workforce participation, particularly in urban settings.  The text further elaborates on reasons for lower female participation, including societal factors.


**6. With reference to the composition of the Indian workforce, consider the following statements:**

1. Self-employed workers constituted the largest segment of the workforce in India during 1999-2000.
2. Casual wage labourers formed a smaller proportion of the workforce in urban areas compared to rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Chart 7.1 shows that self-employed workers constituted the largest segment of the workforce, exceeding 50% for both men and women. This makes it the dominant category of employment in India.

Statement 2 is also correct. Chart 7.2 reveals that the proportion of casual wage laborers was higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Although both are significant contributors to the workforce, casual labor forms a larger portion of the rural workforce than the urban workforce.


**7.  Consider the following statements about employment in firms, factories, and offices in India:**

1.  The eight industrial divisions include agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and services.
2.  The shift from agriculture to the service sector occurred gradually, with a significant intermediary phase dominated by manufacturing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly lists the eight industrial divisions, confirming the inclusion of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and services.  These are clearly identified as major sectors of economic activity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text describes a shift from agriculture to services, it does not depict a significant intermediary phase of manufacturing dominance.  Instead, the text suggests a more direct shift from agriculture to the service sector, particularly in India and Pakistan,  where the service sector emerged as a major player of development directly after agriculture.  The statement misrepresents the described pattern of sectoral shifts.


**8. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) consistently outpaced the growth of employment from 1960 to 2000.
2.  The phenomenon of "jobless growth" refers to economic expansion without a corresponding increase in employment opportunities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the text indicates that GDP growth exceeded employment growth during the specified period, it also notes fluctuations in GDP growth.  The statement presents an oversimplification of the complex relationship between GDP and employment growth, omitting the acknowledgement of GDP's fluctuating growth. The text does not support the claim of consistent outpacing.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly defines "jobless growth" as the phenomenon where an economy produces more goods and services without generating corresponding employment. This accurately captures the concept's meaning.


**9. With reference to  the distribution of workforce by industrial category in rural India (1999-2000), consider the following statements:**

1.  The primary sector accounted for approximately three-quarters of the rural workforce.
2. The service sector provided employment to a larger proportion of the rural workforce than the secondary sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Table 7.2 shows that in rural India during 1999-2000, the primary sector (Agriculture and Mining) employed 76.7% of the workforce. This clearly supports the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Table 7.2 indicates that the secondary sector (10.8%) employed a larger share of the rural workforce than the service sector (12.5%). While the service sector's share is not insignificant, it was smaller than the secondary sector's contribution to rural employment during the year 1999-2000.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding employment and economic activities:**

1.  All activities that contribute to a nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are considered economic activities.
2.  Only those who receive payment for their work are classified as workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text defines economic activities as those that contribute to a nation's GDP. This is a standard macroeconomic definition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clarifies that self-employed individuals are also considered workers, even if they do not receive direct payment from an employer. This broadens the definition of "worker" beyond those receiving explicit wages or salaries.  The definition includes those engaged in economic activity, regardless of payment structure.


**11. With reference to the characteristics of the Indian workforce in 1999-2000, consider the following statements:**

1. Men constituted approximately 70% of the total workforce.
2. Women comprised one-third of the rural workforce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text states that about 70% of the workers were men. This directly supports the statement.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explicitly mentions that women accounted for one-third of the rural workforce.  This accurately reflects the provided data on gender composition within the rural workforce.


**12. Consider the following statements concerning employment patterns in India:**

1.  The growth of employment in the formal sector has significantly outpaced that of the informal sector in recent decades.
2.  Outsourcing has led to a shift in the nature of employment, with a growing number of jobs becoming informal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage indicates that the growth of employment has decelerated and that newly emerging jobs are mostly in the informal sector, implying that formal sector growth has not significantly surpassed informal sector growth. The text does not support the idea of significantly faster formal sector growth.

Statement 2 is correct. The text directly mentions the increasing trend of outsourcing, leading to the creation of more informal jobs. The shift toward informal work is linked to outsourcing practices, accurately reflecting the described changes in the nature of employment.


**13. With reference to government initiatives to address unemployment in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Government employment generation programs focus exclusively on creating jobs in the formal sector.
2.  These programs aim to provide employment while simultaneously delivering services in various sectors like health and education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the government aims to generate employment, the text indicates that these initiatives are aimed at providing employment and services across sectors, including primary health, education, and rural infrastructure development.  This suggests a broader focus than solely on the formal sector.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that government programs aim to provide employment along with services in areas like primary health, education, and rural infrastructure.  This dual objective is clearly stated.


**14. Consider the following statements concerning the informalization of the Indian workforce:**

1. The proportion of casual wage laborers has been steadily increasing in recent decades.
2. Workers in the informal sector generally enjoy the same social security benefits as those in the formal sector.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text shows a clear trend of increasing casualization of the workforce, indicating a rise in the proportion of casual wage laborers.  Data from tables supports this trend.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly contrasts the formal and informal sectors, highlighting that workers in the formal sector enjoy social security benefits, unlike those in the informal sector. This difference in social security provisions is a key feature of the distinction between formal and informal employment.


**15. With reference to the sectoral distribution of workforce in India, consider the following statements:**

1. In 1999-2000, the service sector contributed more to GDP than the agricultural sector.
2.  The shift from agriculture to industry and then to services followed a consistent pattern across all three countries (India, China, and Pakistan).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the text doesn't directly state this for 1999-2000, Table 10.3 shows that in 2003, the service sector contributed 51% to India’s GDP, while agriculture contributed 23%. This suggests a similar pattern would have likely existed in 1999-2000. The service sector's substantial contribution to GDP is in contrast to the agricultural sector's comparatively smaller contribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text highlights that in India and Pakistan, the shift occurred directly to the service sector, deviating from the typical pattern of a gradual transition from agriculture to manufacturing and then to services observed in China. The statement incorrectly assumes a uniform sectoral shift pattern across the three countries.


**16. With reference to employment in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The growth of GDP always correlates directly with the growth of employment.
2.  The worker-population ratio indicates the proportion of the population actively involved in economic activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly discusses the phenomenon of "jobless growth," illustrating that GDP growth does not always directly correlate with employment growth.  This disproves the statement's assertion of a direct correlation.

Statement 2 is correct. The text defines the worker-population ratio as an indicator of the proportion of the population actively engaged in producing goods and services. This definition aligns with the standard use of this economic indicator.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian economy:**

1.  The majority of workers in India are employed in the formal sector, enjoying social security benefits.
2.  The informal sector plays a significant role in India's economy but often lacks social security measures for its workers.

1.  In the 1980s, Pakistan's GDP growth rate surpassed that of India, while China maintained double-digit growth.
2.  By 2003, the service sector contributed the most to GDP in both India and Pakistan, while manufacturing dominated in China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The provided data indicates that Pakistan briefly outperformed India in GDP growth during the 1980s, a period when China experienced sustained double-digit expansion. This reflects the varying economic trajectories and policy approaches of these nations during that era.  This highlights the complexities of comparing economic development across different countries and time periods, influenced by factors like internal policies and global economic trends.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The data shows that by 2003, the service sector had become the largest contributor to GDP in both India and Pakistan. This contrasts with China's economy, where manufacturing held the dominant position in terms of GDP contribution.

The passage explicitly states that China consistently outperforms both India and Pakistan across various HDI indicators, including income, poverty rates, and health outcomes.  This underscores the significant differences in human development achievements among these nations, highlighting the diverse factors that contribute to a nation’s overall progress.  It also reflects the importance of considering multiple indicators when assessing development, rather than relying on a single metric.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text notes that while Pakistan shows better performance than India in some areas like poverty reduction and access to basic amenities (sanitation and water), both countries significantly lag behind China in reducing maternal mortality. This illustrates the complex and multifaceted nature of human development, where progress in one area doesn't always translate to advancement in others. Maternal mortality rates, in particular, serve as a critical indicator of healthcare access and quality, particularly for women. The disparity here highlights the need for targeted interventions to improve healthcare, particularly for women and children.

**3. With reference to the employment and output growth in India, China, and Pakistan, consider the following statements:**

1.  China's economic growth in the period 1980-2003 was primarily driven by the manufacturing sector, while India's growth was mainly fueled by the service sector.

This highlights the different development paths taken by these nations, influenced by various factors including policy choices, resource endowments, and global economic conditions. The contrast emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific drivers of economic growth in different contexts.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text indicates that all three nations experienced a slowdown in agricultural growth during the 1990s.  However, it also highlights China's continued double-digit growth in its industrial sector. This showcases the varying capacity of different economies to adapt and diversify their productive sectors.  The contrasting performance in agriculture versus industry underscores the importance of structural transformation for sustained economic growth.

**4. Consider the following statements regarding the challenges faced by India in achieving inclusive growth:**

1.  A significant portion of India's population remains below the poverty line, lacking the education and skills necessary for formal employment.
2.  Despite the high proportion of India's population engaged in agriculture, this sector contributes only a small fraction of the GDP, characterized by low productivity and wages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage clearly points out that a substantial percentage of India's population (around 30%, according to the Rangarajan committee report) lives below the poverty line.  A key aspect of this poverty is the lack of education and skills among the poor, limiting their access to formal employment and higher-paying jobs. This underscores the vicious cycle of poverty and its link to human capital development.  Addressing this requires significant investment in education and skill development programs.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text highlights that a large segment of India's population depends on agriculture (43%), but this sector contributes only a small percentage to the nation's GDP (16%). This discrepancy is a direct result of low productivity and wages within the agricultural sector.  Several factors contribute to this, including fragmented landholdings, dependence on monsoons, and a lack of access to modern technology and credit.  Resolving this requires comprehensive agricultural reforms, focusing on improving productivity, providing better access to credit and technology, and creating alternative livelihood options.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage directly mentions the decline in India's child sex ratio as evidence of rising female foeticide, a serious social issue reflecting gender inequality and societal biases. This highlights the need for stronger legal frameworks and social awareness campaigns to combat this practice.  The declining sex ratio also has long-term implications for the country's demographic structure and social fabric.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explicitly states that a substantial percentage (more than 50%) of married women in India suffer from anaemia, a significant contributor to maternal mortality.  Anaemia is often linked to malnutrition and poor healthcare access, highlighting the need for improved nutrition programs and accessible healthcare services, especially for women.  Maternal mortality is a crucial indicator of a country's overall healthcare system's effectiveness, and its high rate in India points to serious challenges that need to be addressed.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly points to regional disparities in India's development as a factor contributing to social problems such as crime and unrest.  This uneven development creates pockets of exclusion and inequality, leading to frustration and conflict.  Addressing this requires targeted policies to promote balanced regional development.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage clearly warns that if India fails to address the aspirations of its large marginalized population, its demographic dividend (the potential economic benefit of a young and growing population) could become a demographic nightmare. This highlights the importance of inclusive growth in harnessing the demographic dividend effectively.  Failure to do so could lead to social instability and hinder economic progress.


**9. With reference to poverty estimation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Planning Commission, using data from the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO), has historically estimated poverty based on consumption expenditure.
2.  The Tendulkar and Rangarajan committees, appointed by the Planning Commission, used different poverty lines, leading to varying estimates of the poverty rate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the Planning Commission historically relied on consumption expenditure data from the NSSO to estimate poverty rates. This method assesses poverty based on a household's ability to meet a minimum level of consumption.  However, the definition of this minimum level and the methodology used have been subject to debate and revision over time.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The passage mentions both the Tendulkar and Rangarajan committees, highlighting that they employed different poverty lines and methodologies, leading to different estimates of the poverty rate. This reflects the complexities and challenges in accurately measuring poverty, with various factors influencing the results.  The discrepancies between these estimates highlight the need for continuous refinement of methodologies and a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted nature of poverty.


**10. With reference to infrastructure development in India, consider the following statements:**

2.  The government's reform policies aim to attract private and foreign investment in infrastructure by offering various incentives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage acknowledges India's progress in infrastructure development but emphasizes the uneven distribution, with significant gaps between urban and rural areas.  Many rural areas still lack access to essential facilities like roads, telecommunications, electricity, schools, and hospitals.  This disparity underscores the need for targeted policies to bridge the infrastructure gap between urban and rural India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage clearly mentions that the government's reform policies aim to attract private and foreign investment in infrastructure by offering various concessions and incentives.

**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  It primarily aims to provide financial assistance to farmers for specific crop cultivation.
2.  It seeks to integrate small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) is a scheme designed to provide funding to micro and small enterprises. Its core objective is to bring these small businesses into the formal financial system, thereby providing them access to credit and boosting economic activity.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this primary goal. Statement 1 is incorrect; while MUDRA might indirectly benefit farmers who run micro-enterprises, its primary focus is not on agricultural loans.  Providing loans to farmers for specific crops falls under different government schemes. The scheme doesn't directly address pension provision (option C) or funding voluntary organizations (option D).


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Government's Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme:**

1.  These schemes aim to increase Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Both the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are initiatives designed to mobilize the large quantities of gold held as idle assets within Indian households. By offering attractive investment options, these schemes aim to channel this gold into the formal financial system, boosting economic activity and reducing reliance on gold imports. Statement 2 accurately captures this core objective. Statement 1 is incorrect; while these schemes might indirectly influence FDI, their primary focus is not on attracting foreign investment into the gold and jewelry sector.  The schemes are not primarily concerned with FDI (option A) or reducing India’s dependence on gold imports (option C).

Legal tender is not limited to metallic money (option A).


**7. With reference to Treasury bills, consider the following statements:**

1.  Treasury bills are issued by both the Government of India and State Governments.
2.  Treasury bills are typically issued at a discount to their face value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued by governments to raise funds.  A key characteristic is that they are sold at a discount to their face value (the amount repaid at maturity). Statement 2 correctly describes this feature. Statement 1 is incorrect; while the Government of India issues treasury bills, State Governments generally do not issue them directly.  State governments do not issue treasury bills (option A).


**8.  Consider the following statements regarding the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):**

1.  CAR is determined by each individual bank based on its risk assessment.
2.  CAR represents the amount banks must maintain as their own funds to offset potential losses from loan defaults.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

This capital acts as a buffer to absorb potential losses from loan defaults or other financial shocks. Statement 2 accurately describes the purpose of CAR. Statement 1 is incorrect; while banks assess their risks, the minimum CAR requirement is set by regulatory authorities (like the Reserve Bank of India in India), not determined individually by each bank. CAR is not set by individual banks (option A).


**9. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deposits held by customers are considered an asset of the bank.
2.  Advances (loans) given by the bank are considered an asset of the bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

For a commercial bank, loans given to customers (advances) are assets, representing the bank's claims on borrowers.  Deposits, on the other hand, are liabilities, representing the bank's obligations to depositors. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; deposits are liabilities, not assets, of the bank.  Deposits are liabilities (option A).


**10. With reference to factors contributing to reducing the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following:**

1.  Increasing government expenditure significantly reduces the risk of a currency crisis.
2.  Remittances from Indians working abroad contribute to strengthening the currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A stable currency is influenced by various factors. Remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) represent a significant inflow of foreign exchange, bolstering the country's foreign exchange reserves and strengthening the currency. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; increasing government expenditure, particularly if financed through borrowing, can put pressure on the currency and increase the risk of a crisis.  Increased government expenditure can increase currency crisis risk (option A).


**11. Consider the following statements regarding measures taken by the Government/RBI to curb a decline in the value of the Indian Rupee:**

1.  Easing conditions for external commercial borrowing is a common measure to support the Rupee.
2.  Curbing imports of non-essential goods and promoting exports are measures to support the Rupee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

When the Rupee depreciates, the government and RBI often take steps to stabilize it.  Restricting imports (especially non-essential items) reduces demand for foreign currency and promoting exports increases supply, thus supporting the Rupee. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; easing conditions for external commercial borrowing can actually lead to increased demand for foreign currency and put downward pressure on the Rupee. Easing external commercial borrowing can weaken the Rupee (option A).


**12. With reference to the money multiplier in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) leads to an increase in the money multiplier.
2.  An increase in the banking habit of the population leads to an increase in the money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The money multiplier reflects the potential of the banking system to create credit.  Increased banking penetration (more people using banks) allows banks to lend more, thus increasing the money multiplier. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; a higher CRR reduces the amount banks can lend, thereby decreasing the money multiplier.  Higher CRR decreases the money multiplier (option A).


**13. Consider the following statements about actions/policies that could provide immunity to India in another global financial crisis:**

1.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility is a crucial step for immunity.
2.  Reducing dependence on short-term foreign borrowings enhances resilience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Vulnerability to global financial crises can be mitigated through sound economic policies.  Reducing reliance on short-term foreign debt minimizes the risk of sudden capital flight during a crisis, enhancing a country's resilience. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; while capital account convertibility offers certain benefits, it can also increase vulnerability to external shocks during a crisis, making it a double-edged sword.  Full capital account convertibility can increase crisis vulnerability (option A).


**14. With reference to the immediate effect on aggregate money supply when Rs. 1,00,000 is withdrawn in cash from a demand deposit account, consider the following statements:**

1.  The aggregate money supply will reduce by exactly Rs. 1,00,000.
2.  The aggregate money supply will decrease, but by a potentially larger amount than Rs. 1,00,000 due to the money multiplier effect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Withdrawing cash from a demand deposit account directly reduces the money supply by the amount withdrawn. However, the effect is amplified by the money multiplier.  Banks use deposits to make loans, and this lending process creates money. When cash is withdrawn, the lending capacity of the bank reduces, leading to a contraction of the money supply greater than the initial withdrawal. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect because it ignores the money multiplier effect. The reduction is more than the initial amount (option A).


**15.  With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, consider the following purposes for which short-term credit support is provided:**

1.  Construction of a family house and setting up of a village cold storage facility are included.
2.  Working capital for farm maintenance, post-harvest expenses, and consumption needs of farm households are included.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme offers credit to farmers for various agricultural activities.  It primarily focuses on providing short-term credit for working capital needs related to farm operations, post-harvest management, and meeting the consumption requirements of farming families. Statement 2 accurately reflects these core purposes. Statement 1 is incorrect; long-term investments like house construction and cold storage facility establishment are typically not covered under the short-term credit provision of the KCC scheme.  Long-term investments are not included (option A).


**16.  Consider the following statements about financial instruments in the Indian economy:**

1.  A Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a short-term instrument issued by scheduled commercial banks to corporations.
2.  Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term debt instrument issued by large corporations to raise funds directly from the market.  It is unsecured, meaning it doesn't involve any collateral. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are also short-term instruments, but they are issued by banks, not corporations.  CDs are issued by banks (option A).


**17. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FDI primarily involves investments made by foreign institutional investors in government securities.
2.  FDI is characterized as a largely non-debt-creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) represents long-term investment made by foreign entities to gain control or influence over domestic businesses.  It typically takes the form of equity investment, creating ownership stakes and not primarily relying on debt financing. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; FDI is distinct from investments in government securities, which are typically made by foreign portfolio investors.  FDI is not primarily investment in government securities (option A).


**18.  Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1.  The RBI Governor's appointment is made by the President of India based on the recommendation of the Finance Minister.
2.  The RBI Act grants the RBI Governor significant powers in managing monetary policy and banking regulation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is India's central bank, and its Governor plays a crucial role in monetary policy and banking supervision.  The RBI Act empowers the Governor with substantial authority in these areas. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; the RBI Governor is appointed by the Central Government, not directly by the President based on the recommendation of only the Finance Minister.  The Governor is appointed by the Central Government (option A).


**19. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  UCBs are supervised and regulated by RBI.
2.  UCBs can issue both equity shares and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) operate under the regulatory framework of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  They are subject to RBI supervision and regulation to ensure their financial soundness and stability.  Also, UCBs, as cooperative entities, have the ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity and preference shares. Both statements are correct.


**20. Consider the following factors that influence Indian Government Bond Yields:**

1.  Actions of the United States Federal Reserve (US Fed) have a significant influence.
2.  Inflation and short-term interest rates are major factors influencing bond yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Government bond yields are influenced by various domestic and international factors.  The actions of the US Fed, as the world's most influential central bank, impact global interest rates and capital flows, which in turn affect Indian bond yields.  Domestically, inflation and short-term interest rates are key drivers of bond yields, reflecting the risk and return dynamics of these instruments.  Both statements are correct.


**21. With reference to what can be included in Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), consider the following:**

1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds are considered FDI.
2.  Non-resident external deposits are considered FDI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) involves long-term investments to gain control or significant influence over a domestic company.  Foreign currency convertible bonds and non-resident external deposits do not represent FDI as they do not give any control or significant influence over a domestic company.  Both statements are incorrect.


**22. Consider the following effects of currency devaluation:**

1.  Devaluation necessarily improves a country's trade balance.
2.  Devaluation necessarily improves the competitiveness of domestic exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Currency devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper in the international market, boosting their competitiveness.  However, the impact on the trade balance is not always guaranteed as import prices also increase. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; while devaluation can help improve the trade balance, it’s not a guaranteed outcome and depends on various factors such as price elasticity of demand for imports and exports.  Trade balance improvement is not guaranteed (option A).


**23. With reference to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following:**

1.  Inflation-indexing wages is a major cause of demand-pull inflation.
2.  Expansionary monetary policies can contribute to demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, pushing prices upward.  Expansionary monetary policies, which increase the money supply, can fuel aggregate demand and contribute to this type of inflation. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; while wage increases can contribute to inflation, inflation-indexing wages by itself is not a primary cause of demand-pull inflation.  Inflation-indexing wages is not the primary cause (option A).


**24. With reference to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates, consider the following statements:**

1.  PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing prices of a similar basket of goods and services in different countries.
2.  According to the PPP, India is among the top five largest economies in the world.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It aims to show the relative purchasing power of currencies, accounting for price differences across countries. Statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect; while India's economy is large, its ranking in terms of PPP is not among the top five largest economies.  India is not among top five largest economies according to PPP (option B).


**25. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of increasing absolute and per capita real GNP:**

1.  Increasing absolute and per capita real GNP always implies higher economic development.
2.  If poverty and unemployment increase while real GNP rises, it doesn't indicate higher economic development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Growth in Gross National Product (GNP) doesn't automatically equate to improved economic development.  Economic development is a broader concept encompassing factors like poverty reduction, improved living standards, and equitable distribution of wealth.  If GNP increases but poverty and unemployment remain high, it suggests that the benefits of growth are not reaching the wider population, indicating a lack of inclusive development. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect as it is not always true that increasing absolute and per capita real GNP implies higher economic development.  Higher GNP does not always mean higher development (option A).


**26. Consider the following statements on why capital formation might not significantly increase output despite high savings:**

1.  High population density is a factor that can impede the positive impact of capital formation on output.
2.  Weak administrative machinery can hinder the efficient allocation of capital and reduce its impact on output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

High savings rates are a necessary condition for capital formation, but they are not sufficient to ensure significant output increases.  Several factors can hinder the translation of savings into productive capital and higher output. High population density can strain resources and infrastructure, reducing the effectiveness of capital investment.  Weak administrative machinery can lead to inefficiencies in resource allocation, corruption, and a lack of transparency, all of which can negatively impact capital formation's effect on output. Both statements are correct.


**27. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) primarily uses the WPI to measure inflation and set monetary policy rates.
2. The CPI gives more weight to food items compared to the WPI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CPI and WPI are different measures of inflation.  While the WPI tracks price changes at the wholesale level, the CPI measures changes in the price of goods and services consumed by households.  The CPI typically gives a higher weight to food items because they represent a larger share of household budgets compared to the WPI, which focuses on wholesale prices of a broader range of goods. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; the RBI primarily uses the CPI, not the WPI, for monetary policy decisions, as the CPI reflects the impact of price changes on consumers.  RBI primarily uses CPI (option A).


**28. With reference to market demand for a good, consider the following statements:**

1. If the price of a complement good increases, the market demand for the original good will also increase.
2. If a good is an inferior good and consumer incomes increase, the market demand for that good will increase.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Market demand is influenced by various factors, including the prices of related goods and consumer incomes.  If the price of a complement good (a good often consumed together with the original good) increases, the demand for the original good will usually decrease, not increase, because consumers will likely reduce their consumption of both goods due to the higher overall cost.  If a good is inferior (meaning demand falls as income rises), an increase in consumer incomes will lead to a decrease in demand for that good, not an increase, because consumers will shift towards superior goods. Both statements are incorrect.


**29. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements about Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER):**

1. An increase in NEER indicates a depreciation of the Rupee.
2. An increase in REER indicates an improvement in the trade competitiveness of the Indian economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NEER and REER are different measures of a currency's value. NEER simply measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies without considering inflation. An increase in NEER means the Rupee has become stronger (appreciated) relative to other currencies. Statement 1 is incorrect. REER adjusts for inflation by considering purchasing power. An increase in REER does not necessarily indicate improved trade competitiveness as it also depends on other factors like productivity. Statement 2 is incorrect. Only statement 1 is incorrect.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1.  Historically, the Indian government solely managed infrastructure development, but private sector involvement has increased significantly.
2.  Rural India lags significantly in infrastructure compared to urban areas, with limited access to electricity, safe drinking water, and sanitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The passage explicitly mentions the government's traditional dominance in infrastructure development and the subsequent rise of private sector participation, often in public-private partnerships (PPPs).  This shift reflects a broader trend in many developing economies towards leveraging private sector efficiency and investment.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text highlights the stark disparity between rural and urban infrastructure in India.  It cites statistics on low electricity access (56% of households in 2001), limited tap water availability (24% in 2001), and extremely low access to improved sanitation (6% in 1996). This rural-urban divide is a persistent challenge for India's development goals, hindering equitable access to basic services and contributing to regional disparities.  The significant difference in access to these essential services underscores the need for targeted interventions and policy reforms focused on rural development.


**2. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Investment in education is the sole significant source of human capital formation in India.
2.  Government intervention in education and healthcare is justified due to the long-term impact and information asymmetry in these sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While investment in education is a crucial component of human capital formation, the passage identifies several other sources, including investments in health, on-the-job training, migration, and information acquisition.  A comprehensive approach to human capital development necessitates a multifaceted strategy addressing these various contributing factors.  Neglecting any of these elements would lead to an incomplete and potentially less effective development strategy.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage strongly advocates for government intervention in education and healthcare, citing two primary reasons: the substantial long-term impact of these investments and the existence of information asymmetry (where consumers lack complete information about service quality and costs). This information asymmetry can lead to market failures, necessitating government regulation and intervention to ensure quality standards and prevent exploitation.  The argument for government intervention aligns with the broader policy debate on the role of the state in providing essential public goods.


**3. Consider the following statements about India's employment situation:**

1.  The growth of employment in India has consistently outpaced the growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the past few decades.
2.  The informal sector constitutes a large and growing proportion of India’s workforce, characterized by low wages, limited social security, and high vulnerability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that while GDP grew positively, employment growth was slower and even declined in the late 1990s. This resulted in what economists refer to as "jobless growth," a significant concern for policymakers aiming for inclusive development.  The disparity between GDP growth and employment creation highlights the need for policies that stimulate employment generation alongside economic expansion.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage extensively discusses the informalization of the Indian workforce.  It emphasizes the large size of the informal sector (93% of the workforce in 1999-2000), its characteristics of low wages, lack of social security benefits, and the vulnerability of its workers. This informalization poses a major challenge to India's development goals, requiring targeted interventions to improve working conditions and provide social safety nets. The high proportion of workers in the informal sector is a key indicator of the country's structural economic challenges.


**4. With reference to India's poverty estimation, consider the following statements:**

1.  The poverty line in India is universally defined and consistently applied across all regions and time periods.
2.  Various expert committees, such as those led by Lakdawala, Tendulkar, and Rangarajan, have been appointed to revise the methodology for poverty estimation in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage highlights that defining a poverty line is a contentious issue in India. The perception of poverty varies across time and regions, leading to different methodologies and resulting in varying estimates.  The lack of a universally accepted and consistently applied definition makes comparative analysis challenging and complicates policy design.  The debate surrounding the poverty line reflects the complexity of measuring a multi-dimensional concept.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly names Lakdawala, Tendulkar, and Rangarajan committees as examples of expert groups tasked with reviewing and revising the methodology for poverty estimation.  These revisions reflect the need to adapt the poverty line to changing economic circumstances and ensure the relevance of poverty estimates.  The establishment of these committees demonstrates a commitment to improving the accuracy and reliability of poverty data.


**5. With reference to India's health infrastructure, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's health expenditure as a percentage of GDP is substantially higher than that of many other developed and developing countries.
2.  A significant portion of India's Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is attributed to communicable diseases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that India's health expenditure as a percentage of GDP is abysmally low compared to other countries. This low level of investment in healthcare directly impacts the quality and accessibility of healthcare services, particularly in rural areas.  The low expenditure is a major constraint on achieving better health outcomes.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage indicates that a substantial portion of India's GBD (Global Burden of Disease) is due to communicable diseases like diarrhoea, malaria, and tuberculosis. This highlights the persistent challenge of infectious diseases in India, despite advancements in other areas of healthcare.  The high prevalence of communicable diseases underscores the need for effective public health programs and improved sanitation.


**6.  Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural sector:**

1.  The agricultural sector in India contributes a disproportionately high percentage of the GDP compared to its share of the workforce.
2.  Challenges faced by the agricultural sector include fragmented land holdings and dependence on monsoons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the agricultural sector, despite employing 43% of the population, contributes only 16% to the GDP. This signifies low productivity and the need for structural reforms to enhance efficiency and income generation in the sector. The low contribution to GDP despite high workforce participation is a key indicator of the sector's challenges.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage identifies fragmented land holdings and heavy dependence on monsoons as key challenges facing the agricultural sector. These factors contribute to low productivity, income instability, and vulnerability to climate change. Addressing these issues requires investments in irrigation, land consolidation, and climate-resilient agricultural practices.


**7. With reference to inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Inclusive growth solely focuses on achieving high national income growth.
2.  Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh emphasized increased investment in rural areas, rural infrastructure, and agriculture as key components of an inclusive growth strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly defines inclusive growth as going beyond high national income growth to address employment promotion, poverty reduction, balanced regional development, and improved human development.  It emphasizes the need for equitable distribution of wealth and prosperity, highlighting that high GDP growth alone is insufficient for inclusive development.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage directly quotes Manmohan Singh's emphasis on increased investment in rural areas, rural infrastructure, agriculture, rural employment, and public spending on education and healthcare as crucial elements of an inclusive growth strategy.  His statement reflects the understanding that inclusive growth requires targeted interventions to address regional and social disparities.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the formal and informal sectors in India:**

1.  Workers in the formal sector generally enjoy better social security benefits than those in the informal sector.
2.  The formal sector in India is predominantly composed of women workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage clearly differentiates between the formal and informal sectors, noting that formal sector workers enjoy various social security benefits, such as maternity benefits, provident funds, gratuity, and pensions, which are largely absent in the informal sector.  This difference in social protection highlights the vulnerability of informal sector workers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage states that men constitute the majority of workers in both the formal and informal sectors, with women forming only a small percentage (17%) of the formal sector workforce in 1999-2000.  This gender disparity in employment reflects broader societal inequalities.  The low representation of women in the formal sector underscores the need for policies promoting gender equality in the workplace.


These questions aim to test a deeper understanding of the subject matter, going beyond simple recall and demanding analysis and application of knowledge.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring careful consideration of the provided information.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Indian economy's monetary policy transmission mechanism, consider the following statements:**

1. The Base Rate, introduced in July 2010, was calculated using the average cost of funds, while the Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR), introduced later, uses the marginal cost of funds.
2.  The introduction of external benchmark lending rates aimed to improve the speed and transparency of monetary policy transmission by directly linking lending rates to market benchmarks like the repo rate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Base Rate system, introduced to replace the Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR), initially used the average cost of funds to calculate the minimum lending rate for commercial banks.  The subsequent shift to the MCLR system utilized the marginal cost of funds, reflecting the cost of obtaining additional funds. This change aimed to make the lending rate more responsive to changes in the policy repo rate.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The mandate to link new floating-rate loans to an external benchmark (like the repo rate, treasury bill yields, or other published benchmark rates) significantly improved monetary policy transmission. This direct link ensured that changes in the policy rate swiftly translate into changes in lending rates, enhancing transparency and efficiency in the process.  The previous systems faced delays due to reliance on internal benchmarks like the Base Rate or MCLR which were not always directly responsive to changes in the policy rate.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Balance of Payments (BoP) in India:**

1.  Remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are recorded under the current account of the BoP, while payments to NRIs by their Indian employers are not included.
2.  India's current account convertibility implies that the rupee is fully convertible for transactions under the current account of the BoP, while capital account convertibility is only partial.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Remittances, which are essentially private transfers of money from NRIs to their families in India, are considered unilateral transfers and are recorded under the current account of the BoP.  However, salaries or payments made by Indian employers to NRIs working abroad are considered factor income and are also part of the current account. The key distinction lies in whether the transaction is a gift or payment for services rendered.

Statement 2 is also correct.  India has achieved full current account convertibility, meaning that the rupee is freely convertible for current account transactions like imports, exports, and income receipts. This allows for unrestricted exchange of rupees for foreign currencies for these purposes.  However, capital account convertibility remains partial, with restrictions and regulations on capital flows to maintain macroeconomic stability and manage potential risks.


**3. With reference to the concept of inclusive growth in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Inclusive growth emphasizes both the pace and pattern of economic growth, prioritizing broad-based growth across sectors and the inclusion of a large section of the labor force.
2. The concept of inclusive growth focuses primarily on income redistribution schemes as a long-term solution for poverty reduction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the core principles of inclusive growth.  It stresses that rapid economic growth is not enough; the growth must be equitable and benefit all segments of society. This requires a broad-based approach, encompassing various sectors and ensuring that the benefits reach the most vulnerable populations.  The focus is on creating productive employment opportunities and fostering a fairer distribution of resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While income redistribution schemes can play a role in mitigating inequality in the short term, they are not the primary focus or a long-term solution for poverty reduction under the inclusive growth paradigm. The emphasis is on creating sustainable economic opportunities and empowering marginalized groups through productive employment and access to resources, rather than solely relying on transfers.


**4. With reference to  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI involves investment in capital instruments of an Indian company, exceeding 10 percent of its equity capital, while FPI involves investments below this threshold.
2.  All FDI inflows into India are subject to government approval, while FPI is largely unregulated.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The distinction between FDI and FPI in India is primarily based on the percentage of equity ownership.  FDI is defined as investment exceeding 10 percent of the equity capital of a listed company or any investment in an unlisted company. FPI, on the other hand, represents investments below this 10 percent threshold in listed companies.  This distinction is crucial for regulatory purposes and influences the level of control and influence the foreign investor holds.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A significant portion of FDI in India flows through the automatic route, requiring no prior government approval.  Only certain sectors or investments exceeding specified thresholds require government approval.  FPI, however, is regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) and is subject to various regulations and guidelines concerning investment limits, reporting requirements, etc.


**5. With reference to Systemically Important Institutions (SIIs) in the Indian financial sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  Domestic Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) are those with asset sizes exceeding 2% of India's GDP, as determined annually by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) designates Domestic Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial Companies (D-SIB-NBFCs) based on asset size and other relevant criteria.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI identifies DSIBs based on their asset size relative to the nation's GDP.  These banks are considered too big to fail and are subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and capital requirements. The threshold of 2% of GDP is a key criterion for this designation, ensuring that only the largest and most systemically important banks are included.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IRDAI designates Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs), not D-SIB-NBFCs.  While NBFCs can be systemically important, their designation and criteria are determined by the RBI, not the IRDAI. The IRDAI focuses on the systemic importance of insurance companies, considering factors like assets under management and premium income.  The criteria for designating systemically important institutions vary across different financial sectors.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in absolute and per capita real GNP does not necessarily indicate higher economic development if poverty and unemployment remain high.
2.  High savings in an economy guarantee significant increases in output, provided there is efficient capital formation and utilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While an increase in Gross National Product (GNP) signifies overall economic growth, it doesn't fully capture the nuances of development.  A rise in GNP might be accompanied by increased inequality, where the benefits accrue disproportionately to a small segment of the population, leaving poverty and unemployment largely unaffected.  Genuine economic development encompasses improvements in living standards, reduction in poverty and unemployment, better health and education indicators, and overall societal well-being.  Focusing solely on GNP ignores these crucial aspects of human development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  High savings are a necessary but not sufficient condition for increased output.  The efficiency of capital formation and its utilization are equally crucial.  Even with high savings, if capital is misallocated, invested in unproductive ventures, or hindered by factors like weak administrative machinery, illiteracy, or a high capital-output ratio, the resulting increase in output might be insignificant.  The capital-output ratio, in particular, reflects the efficiency of capital in generating output. A high capital-output ratio implies that a large amount of capital investment is needed to produce a unit of output, indicating inefficiency.  Therefore, high savings alone do not guarantee significant output growth.


**2. With reference to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1.  PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of a standardized basket of goods and services across different countries, adjusted for inflation.
2.  India's ranking as a global economy is significantly higher when measured using PPP dollars compared to its ranking using nominal exchange rates.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It aims to determine the relative value of currencies by comparing the prices of identical goods and services in different countries.  The calculation adjusts for differences in inflation rates to provide a more accurate comparison of purchasing power across nations.  This method provides a more realistic picture of economic size and living standards compared to using nominal exchange rates which can be heavily influenced by short-term market fluctuations.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's economy, when measured using PPP, shows a significantly higher ranking compared to its ranking based on nominal exchange rates.  This is because PPP takes into account the lower cost of goods and services in India compared to many developed nations.  While nominal exchange rates reflect the current market exchange rate, PPP provides a measure of the relative purchasing power of different currencies, offering a more accurate representation of a country's economic size and standard of living.  The discrepancy between the two rankings highlights the limitations of using nominal exchange rates as the sole measure of economic size, particularly for countries with varying cost structures.


**3. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPI gives greater weight to food items compared to the WPI, reflecting the higher proportion of household expenditure on food in India.
2.  The WPI is a more comprehensive measure of inflation than the CPI because it includes services and indirect taxes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in India gives a significantly higher weight to food items compared to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). This reflects the fact that a substantial portion of household expenditure in India is dedicated to food.  The weighting in the CPI accurately reflects the impact of food price changes on the average consumer's cost of living.  The WPI, on the other hand, focuses on wholesale prices and gives relatively less weight to food.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WPI is *not* a more comprehensive measure of inflation than the CPI.  While the WPI captures changes in the prices of goods at the wholesale level, it traditionally excludes services. The CPI, on the other hand, includes services, which represent a significant portion of consumer expenditure in many economies, including India.  Therefore, the CPI provides a broader reflection of inflation impacting the average consumer.  Moreover, the inclusion of indirect taxes is more relevant to the CPI than the WPI as consumers ultimately bear the burden of these taxes.


**4. With reference to market demand for a good, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the price of a substitute good will lead to an increase in the demand for the good in question.
2. An increase in the price of a complementary good will decrease the demand for the good in question.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of another. If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper alternative, thus increasing the demand for the original good.  This is a fundamental principle of economics demonstrating the relationship between the price of substitutes and the demand for a given good.

Statement 2 is correct. Complementary goods are those that are consumed together.  If the price of a complementary good increases, the demand for the good in question will decrease.  This is because the increased cost of the complementary good reduces the overall desirability and affordability of consuming both goods together.  The decrease in demand reflects the interconnectedness of complementary goods in consumer consumption patterns.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy and exchange rates, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates a depreciation of the Indian Rupee.
2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in India's trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates an *appreciation* of the Rupee.  NEER is an index that measures the value of the Rupee against a basket of other currencies.  An increase means the Rupee has strengthened relative to this basket, making imports cheaper and exports more expensive.

Statement 2 is correct.  An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates a *worsening* of India's trade competitiveness. REER adjusts the NEER for inflation differentials between India and its trading partners.  An increase suggests that Indian goods and services have become relatively more expensive compared to those of its trading partners, making them less competitive in international markets.  This can lead to a decline in exports and a widening of the trade deficit.  Therefore, a lower REER generally indicates better trade competitiveness.



**6. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements regarding demand-pull inflation:**

1. Expansionary monetary policies contribute to demand-pull inflation.
2. Rising interest rates are a primary cause of demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply. Expansionary monetary policies, such as lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply, stimulate economic activity and increase aggregate demand. This increased demand, if not met by a corresponding increase in supply, leads to upward pressure on prices, resulting in demand-pull inflation.  This is a key mechanism through which monetary policy can influence inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rising interest rates are typically used to *combat* inflation, not cause it.  Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, reducing investment and consumer spending, thus decreasing aggregate demand. This counteracts inflationary pressures. While rising interest rates might have some indirect effects on prices in specific sectors, they are not a primary cause of demand-pull inflation.  The fundamental cause is an imbalance between aggregate demand and supply.


**7. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and its actions, consider the following statements:**

1. If inflation is excessively high, the RBI is likely to sell government securities in the open market.
2. If the Rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to buy dollars in the foreign exchange market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  When inflation is high, the RBI typically adopts a contractionary monetary policy to curb inflationary pressures. Selling government securities in the open market reduces the money supply in the economy.  This reduces liquidity, making borrowing more expensive and dampening aggregate demand, which helps to control inflation.  This is a standard tool used by central banks worldwide to manage inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. If the Rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI would typically *sell* dollars (from its foreign exchange reserves) to increase the demand for Rupees and support its value.  Buying dollars would further weaken the Rupee, exacerbating the depreciation.  The RBI's intervention aims to stabilize the exchange rate and prevent excessive volatility.


**8. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. IIBs allow the government to borrow at lower coupon rates compared to conventional bonds.
2. The capital gains earned from IIBs are tax-exempt.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) offer investors protection against inflation.  The principal and interest payments are adjusted based on inflation, making them less risky for investors.  Because of this reduced risk, the government can offer lower coupon rates on IIBs compared to conventional bonds, reducing its borrowing costs.  This is an advantage for the government in managing its public debt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While IIBs offer protection against inflation, the capital gains earned from them are *not* tax-exempt in India.  The interest income and capital gains from IIBs are subject to tax according to the prevailing tax laws.  Therefore, the tax implications should be considered when evaluating the overall return on investment in IIBs.


**9. With reference to the impact of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve could lead to capital flight from India.
2. Devaluation of the Indian Rupee increases the currency risk associated with External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (like raising interest rates) typically attracts foreign investment to the US as it offers higher returns. This can lead to capital flight from other countries, including India, as investors move their funds to the US seeking better returns.  This outflow of capital can negatively impact the Indian economy, putting downward pressure on the Rupee and potentially leading to a shortage of funds for domestic investment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Devaluation of the Indian Rupee actually *decreases* the currency risk associated with External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).  ECBs are loans taken by Indian entities from foreign lenders.  If the Rupee depreciates, the Indian borrower needs to pay back less in Rupee terms, thereby reducing the currency risk.  Appreciation of the Rupee, on the other hand, would increase this risk.


**10. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Convertible bonds offer a lower interest rate compared to non-convertible bonds due to the option to convert into equity.
2. The conversion option in convertible bonds provides indexation to rising consumer prices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Convertible bonds offer a lower interest rate than non-convertible bonds because they provide the bondholder with an option to convert the bond into equity shares of the issuing company at a predetermined price.  This option adds value to the bond, allowing the issuer to offer a lower interest rate while still attracting investors.  The potential upside from equity participation offsets the lower interest income.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While convertible bonds offer some protection against inflation through the potential appreciation of the underlying equity, it is not a direct indexation to rising consumer prices. The value of the equity is influenced by various market factors, not solely by inflation.  The bond's value is tied to the company's performance, which includes many factors beyond inflation.  Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the complexities of convertible bond valuation.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding fiscal stimulus:**

1. Fiscal stimulus involves government investment in manufacturing to address supply shortages caused by rapid economic growth.
2. Fiscal stimulus is primarily an affirmative action to boost overall economic activity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While government investment in manufacturing can be *part* of a broader fiscal stimulus package, it is not the defining characteristic.  Fiscal stimulus is a much broader concept. It encompasses various government actions aimed at boosting aggregate demand and stimulating economic growth, particularly during economic downturns.  These actions may include increased government spending, tax cuts, or a combination of both. Addressing supply-side issues might be a secondary goal, depending on the specific economic situation.

Statement 2 is correct. Fiscal stimulus is fundamentally an affirmative government action designed to boost economic activity.  It aims to increase aggregate demand, create jobs, and stimulate economic growth.  The specific measures employed will vary based on the circumstances and the government's economic objectives, but the underlying goal remains the same – to counteract economic slowdowns or recessions.


**12. With reference to Value Added Tax (VAT), consider the following statements:**

1. VAT is a multi-point tax levied on the value added at each stage of production and distribution.
2. VAT is primarily a tax levied and administered by the Central Government in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Value Added Tax (VAT) is a multi-stage tax levied on the value added at each stage of the production and distribution chain.  It is not a tax on the final sale price but rather on the value added at each step. This ensures that only the value added at each stage is taxed, preventing double taxation.  This system is designed to be more efficient and less burdensome than other indirect tax systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. In India, VAT is primarily a tax levied and administered by the *State* Governments.  While the Central Government plays a role in setting guidelines and frameworks, the actual implementation and collection of VAT are primarily under the purview of state governments. This reflects the federal structure of the Indian tax system.


**13. With reference to the Union Government's finances, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Revenue is primarily responsible for preparing the Union Budget.
2.  All disbursements from the Public Account require parliamentary authorization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Department of Revenue plays a crucial role in preparing the Union Budget, primarily responsible for formulating the tax proposals and revenue projections. While other departments contribute to expenditure proposals, the Department of Revenue is central to the revenue side of the budget.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While all withdrawals from the Consolidated Fund of India require parliamentary authorization, disbursements from the Public Account do *not* necessarily require such authorization. The Public Account holds funds that are not part of the government's general revenue but are managed on behalf of various entities or for specific purposes.  These funds can be disbursed according to established procedures without direct parliamentary approval for each individual transaction.


**14. With reference to the capital budget of the Government of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Expenditure on the acquisition of assets like roads, buildings, and machinery is part of the capital budget.
2. Loans received from foreign governments are classified as revenue receipts in the capital budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The capital budget of the Government of India includes expenditure on acquiring assets that will provide benefits over several years.  This includes infrastructure projects like roads and buildings, as well as machinery and equipment for various government departments.  This type of expenditure is considered capital expenditure because it increases the government's asset base.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Loans received from foreign governments are classified as *capital receipts*, not revenue receipts, in the capital budget.  Revenue receipts are funds obtained from regular sources like taxes, while capital receipts are non-recurring funds obtained through borrowing or disinvestment.  Loans represent a liability for the government but are recorded as capital receipts.


**15. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), consider the following statements:**

1. The GST aims to create a unified national market in India by replacing multiple indirect taxes.
2. The GST significantly reduces India's current account deficit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A major objective of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India was to create a single, unified national market by replacing a multitude of indirect taxes levied by both the central and state governments. This simplification aimed to reduce tax compliance burdens, improve efficiency, and facilitate interstate trade.  The GST created a more streamlined tax system with a common tax base across states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GST might have some indirect effects on India's current account deficit, it is not a primary factor in reducing it.  The current account deficit reflects the balance of trade in goods and services, as well as income flows and transfers.  The GST primarily impacts domestic trade and tax collection; its influence on the current account is indirect and complex, not a significant direct impact.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding India's fiscal deficit and debt:**

1. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act of 2003 mandates a specific fiscal deficit target for the central government.
2.  The FRBM Act allows for deviations from the fiscal deficit target only with the explicit approval of the Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, sets targets for the central government's fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP.  These targets aim to ensure fiscal prudence and maintain macroeconomic stability.  The Act provides a framework for responsible fiscal management, aiming to reduce the government's reliance on borrowing.

Statement 2 is correct. The FRBM Act stipulates that any deviations from the mandated fiscal deficit targets require the explicit approval of the Parliament. This ensures transparency and accountability in fiscal management, preventing arbitrary increases in the fiscal deficit without parliamentary oversight.  This provision is a crucial aspect of the Act's design to maintain fiscal discipline.


**17. With reference to the effects of fiscal deficits, consider the following statements:**

1. Fiscal deficits are always inflationary, regardless of the state of the economy.
2.  "Crowding out" occurs when increased government borrowing reduces private investment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The inflationary impact of fiscal deficits is not automatic.  If an economy has significant underutilized resources (e.g., during a recession), increased government spending can stimulate production without significant inflationary pressure.  The impact depends on the state of the economy and the extent to which the increased demand can be met by increased supply.  In contrast, during periods of full employment, increased government spending is more likely to be inflationary.

Statement 2 is correct. "Crowding out" is an economic phenomenon where increased government borrowing competes with private sector borrowing for available savings. This increased demand for loanable funds can push up interest rates, making it more expensive for businesses to invest, thus reducing private investment.  This is a potential negative consequence of large fiscal deficits, especially in economies with limited savings.


**18. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) sources of income, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI earns interest income from its investments in US government bonds.
2.  Seigniorage is a significant source of income for the RBI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RBI invests a portion of its foreign currency assets in various government bonds, including those issued by the US government.  These investments generate interest income for the RBI, contributing to its overall earnings.  This is a standard practice for central banks to manage their foreign exchange reserves and earn returns on those reserves.

Statement 2 is correct. Seigniorage is the profit earned by the central bank from issuing currency.  It's a significant source of revenue for the RBI.  The difference between the cost of printing and distributing currency and the face value of the currency issued constitutes seigniorage.  This is a non-tax revenue source for the central bank.


**19. With reference to the Economic Capital Framework (ECF) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  A primary objective of the ECF is to ensure the RBI has adequate funds to manage financial crises.
2.  The Bimal Jalan Committee recommended that the RBI maintain a contingency risk buffer of 3.5% to 4.5% of its balance sheet.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Economic Capital Framework (ECF) of the RBI is designed to ensure that the central bank has sufficient capital reserves to absorb potential losses and maintain its financial stability.  This is crucial for the RBI's role in maintaining macroeconomic stability and managing financial crises.  Adequate capital reserves provide a buffer against unexpected shocks and prevent the RBI from becoming insolvent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bimal Jalan Committee recommended a higher contingency risk buffer for the RBI. The committee's recommendation was for a buffer of 5.5% to 6.5% of the RBI's balance sheet, not 3.5% to 4.5%. This reflects the committee's assessment of the risks faced by the RBI and the need for robust capital reserves.


**20. With reference to cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), consider the following statements:**

1. Cryptocurrencies are legal tender in India.
2. CBDCs are issued by central banks and are legal tender.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cryptocurrencies are *not* legal tender in India.  They are not issued or backed by any government or central bank.  While their use is not explicitly illegal, they lack the legal status of fiat currencies.  Transactions in cryptocurrencies are subject to taxation, but they do not have the same legal backing as official currencies.

Statement 2 is correct. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are digital forms of fiat currency issued by central banks.  They are legal tender and are directly exchangeable with physical currency.  CBDCs aim to provide the benefits of digital payments while retaining the trust and stability associated with central bank-issued money.  They are designed to coexist with physical currency, not replace it entirely.




**1. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Expansionary monetary policies, by lowering interest rates, can increase aggregate demand and contribute to demand-pull inflation.  A fiscal stimulus, involving increased government spending or tax cuts, similarly boosts aggregate demand, potentially fueling inflation.
2.  Inflation-indexed wages, where wages are adjusted to reflect the rate of inflation, can contribute to a wage-price spiral, where rising wages lead to higher prices, and vice versa, thereby escalating inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Expansionary monetary policies, characterized by lower interest rates, aim to stimulate economic activity.  Reduced borrowing costs encourage increased investment and consumption, leading to higher aggregate demand. If this demand outpaces the economy's capacity to produce, it results in upward pressure on prices, causing demand-pull inflation.  A fiscal stimulus, involving increased government spending or tax cuts, has a similar effect.  Increased government spending directly boosts demand, while tax cuts leave more disposable income in the hands of consumers, further stimulating demand.  Both policies can therefore contribute to demand-pull inflation, especially in an economy operating near full capacity.

Statement 2 is also correct. Inflation-indexed wages directly contribute to inflationary pressures.  When wages rise in line with inflation, businesses face increased labor costs, which they often pass on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle, where rising wages fuel higher prices, leading to further wage increases (wage-price spiral). This mechanism is a significant contributor to cost-push inflation, a different type of inflation than demand-pull, but still contributes to overall inflationary pressures.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe factors that can increase or cause demand-pull inflation, or contribute to other types of inflation that exacerbate the overall inflationary environment.


**2. With reference to the functions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's purchase of government securities in the open market increases the money supply, potentially leading to increased inflation if not managed carefully.  This is a key tool used to influence liquidity in the banking system.
2.  If the Indian rupee is depreciating rapidly against other currencies, the RBI is likely to intervene by selling foreign currency reserves (like dollars) to increase the demand for the rupee and stabilize its exchange rate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Open market operations (OMO) are a crucial tool in the RBI's monetary policy toolkit. When the RBI buys government securities, it injects liquidity into the banking system. This increases the money supply, which can stimulate economic activity but also has the potential to increase inflation if the increased money supply outpaces the growth in the real output of goods and services.  The RBI carefully manages these operations to balance the need for economic growth with the need to control inflation.

Statement 2 is also correct. The RBI plays a vital role in managing the exchange rate of the Indian rupee.  A rapid depreciation of the rupee can negatively impact the economy, increasing the cost of imports and potentially causing inflation. To counter this, the RBI will often intervene in the foreign exchange market by selling its foreign currency reserves to increase the demand for the rupee and thus stabilize its value. This action helps to prevent excessive volatility in the exchange rate and mitigate potential negative economic consequences.  Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the RBI's role in managing the Indian economy.


**3. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  IIBs help the government reduce coupon rates (the interest rate paid on the bond) because investors are compensated for inflation risk through adjustments to the principal.
2.  The tax treatment of IIBs in India is such that both interest received and capital gains are fully exempt from income tax.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. The principal value of IIBs is adjusted periodically based on a pre-determined inflation index. This feature allows the government to offer lower coupon rates compared to conventional bonds, as investors are compensated for the inflation risk through the principal adjustments.  This makes IIBs attractive to investors seeking protection against inflation and allows the government to borrow at lower interest rates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the interest earned on IIBs is generally tax-exempt, the capital gains from these bonds are subject to income tax.  The tax treatment of IIBs varies depending on the specific terms of the bond issuance and the investor's tax bracket.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes a key characteristic of IIBs in India.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding monetary policy in India:**

1. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in India is responsible for setting the repo rate, but it does not have direct control over other monetary policy tools like the cash reserve ratio (CRR) or the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR).
2.  The primary objective of the monetary policy framework in India is to maintain price stability, with economic growth considered as a secondary objective.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is the apex body responsible for setting the repo rate in India – the rate at which commercial banks borrow from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  However, the MPC's mandate focuses primarily on the repo rate.  Other significant monetary policy tools like CRR and SLR, which influence banks' lending capacity, are under the direct control of the RBI's central board, though the MPC's recommendations regarding the repo rate heavily influence the overall monetary policy stance.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While supporting economic growth is a crucial consideration, the primary mandate of the monetary policy framework in India is to maintain price stability. The inflation target is set by the government in consultation with the RBI, and the MPC's actions are primarily aimed at achieving this target. While growth is a secondary objective, the MPC's decisions are guided by the need to keep inflation within the target range.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of India's monetary policy framework.


**5. With reference to the Indian banking system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The P.J. Nayak Committee recommended the establishment of a Bank Investment Company (BIC) to improve governance and enhance the autonomy of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) by reducing government ownership below 50%.
2. The Financial Services Institutions Bureau (FSIB) currently plays a key role in recommending appointments to the boards of Public Sector Banks (PSBs), financial institutions, and public sector insurers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The P.J. Nayak Committee, established to review the governance of banks in India, recommended significant reforms to enhance the autonomy of Public Sector Banks (PSBs). A central recommendation was the creation of a Bank Investment Company (BIC), a holding company to manage the government's stake in PSBs.  The aim was to reduce direct government interference in the day-to-day operations of banks while maintaining government ownership, initially proposed to be below 50%, to ensure appropriate oversight.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Following the recommendations of the P.J. Nayak Committee and subsequent developments, the Financial Services Institutions Bureau (FSIB) was established.  The FSIB plays a crucial role in the appointment of directors and other key personnel to the boards of PSBs, financial institutions, and public sector insurers.  This body provides a more independent and professional approach to appointments, reducing potential political influence and improving governance.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect important developments in the governance of the Indian banking sector.


**6. With reference to government deficits in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Revenue deficit arises when the government's revenue expenditure exceeds its revenue receipts. This indicates that the government is using savings from other sectors to finance its consumption expenditure.
2. Fiscal deficit is the difference between the government's total expenditure and its total receipts excluding borrowings.  A high fiscal deficit indicates that the government is heavily reliant on borrowing to finance its spending.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Revenue deficit is a crucial indicator of the government's fiscal health.  It represents the gap between the government's revenue expenditure (spending on day-to-day activities like salaries, subsidies, and interest payments) and its revenue receipts (income from taxes and other non-borrowing sources).  A revenue deficit implies that the government is spending more on its current operations than it is earning through its revenue streams, forcing it to rely on borrowings or depleting savings from other sectors to meet its expenses. This is a cause for concern as it indicates a lack of fiscal sustainability.

Statement 2 is also correct. Fiscal deficit is a broader measure of the government's overall borrowing needs. It shows the difference between the government's total expenditure (both revenue and capital) and its total receipts (revenue and capital receipts excluding borrowings). A high fiscal deficit indicates that the government is heavily reliant on borrowing to finance its spending, which can lead to increased public debt and potential macroeconomic instability.  Therefore, both statements accurately define and explain the implications of revenue and fiscal deficits.


**7. With reference to the management of government debt in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) acts as the debt manager for both the central and state governments, handling their borrowing and debt management operations.
2.  The "monetization of deficit" refers to the government's practice of directly printing money to finance its fiscal deficit, a method generally considered inflationary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plays a significant role in managing government debt.  It acts as the debt manager for the central government, handling the issuance of government securities, conducting open market operations, and advising on debt management strategies. While the RBI does not directly manage state government debt, it plays an indirect role through its monetary policy and interaction with the banking system.  The RBI's actions impact the cost and availability of funds for state governments.

Statement 2 is also correct. "Monetization of deficit" is a term used to describe the practice of a government financing its fiscal deficit by printing money.  This approach directly increases the money supply in the economy. If the increased money supply is not accompanied by a similar increase in the production of goods and services, it leads to increased demand without a corresponding increase in supply, causing inflationary pressures. While this is a powerful tool, it is rarely used due to its inflationary consequences and negative effects on macroeconomic stability. Therefore, both statements accurately describe aspects of government debt management and related concepts in India.


**8. With reference to India's tax system, consider the following statements:**

1.  A progressive tax system implies that the tax rate increases as the income of the taxpayer increases. This is generally considered a fairer system for wealth redistribution.
2.  Indirect taxes, such as Goods and Services Tax (GST), are levied on the production or consumption of goods and services, and are typically collected by an intermediary (retailer) from the final consumer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A progressive tax system is a key feature of many modern economies aimed at achieving social equity. In a progressive tax system, higher-income earners pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes compared to lower-income earners. This is achieved through a graduated tax rate structure, with tax brackets and increasing rates applied as income rises.  Progressive taxation is designed to redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality.

Statement 2 is also correct. Indirect taxes are a significant source of revenue for governments worldwide.  These taxes are levied on the sale or consumption of goods and services rather than directly on income. Unlike direct taxes, which are paid directly by individuals or businesses to the government, indirect taxes are typically included in the price of goods and services and collected by an intermediary, such as a retailer, from the consumer.  GST is a prime example of a consumption-based indirect tax.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe fundamental aspects of tax systems.



**1. With reference to the impact of US Federal Reserve actions on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve is likely to lead to capital flight from India.
2. Capital flight from India due to US Federal Reserve actions may increase the interest cost for Indian firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve typically involves raising interest rates. This makes US dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors globally, including those in India.  Statement 1 is correct because higher interest rates in the US incentivize investors to withdraw their funds from Indian markets (capital flight) to seek higher returns in the US.  This capital outflow weakens the Indian rupee and can negatively impact the Indian economy.  Statement 2 is also correct because when capital flees India, the demand for the Indian rupee decreases, leading to its depreciation.  This depreciation increases the rupee cost of repaying ECBs for Indian firms, thus raising their interest costs.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the interconnectedness of global financial markets and the potential repercussions of US monetary policy on emerging economies like India. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only address one aspect of the situation. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are valid consequences of a tight US monetary policy.


**2. With reference to the Indian economy's response to inflation, consider the following statements:**

1.  If inflation in India is excessively high, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to sell government securities in the open market.
2. If the Indian rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to buy dollars in the foreign exchange market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. When inflation is high, the RBI typically employs contractionary monetary policies to curb it. Selling government securities reduces the money supply, thereby decreasing aggregate demand and inflationary pressure.  The statement incorrectly suggests the opposite action. Statement 2 is correct. A rapidly depreciating rupee indicates a decrease in its value relative to other currencies, particularly the US dollar. To counter this depreciation and stabilize the exchange rate, the RBI would intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying dollars using its foreign exchange reserves. This increases the demand for rupees, thus supporting its value.  Options (a) and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the RBI's actions in response to high inflation. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 accurately describes a typical RBI response to a depreciating rupee.


**3. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian government can reduce coupon rates on its borrowings by issuing IIBs.
2. IIBs offer investors complete protection from uncertainty related to inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) adjust their principal and interest payments based on the rate of inflation. This feature allows the government to offer lower coupon rates (interest rates) on its borrowings because the principal is protected from inflation erosion. Investors are willing to accept a lower fixed interest rate because they are compensated for inflation through adjustments to the principal. Statement 2 is incorrect. While IIBs provide a degree of inflation protection, they do not offer *complete* protection. The real return on an IIB still depends on the difference between the inflation rate and the coupon rate. Unexpectedly high inflation could still result in a lower-than-expected real return, although the loss would be mitigated compared to a conventional bond. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the inflation protection offered by IIBs or fail to recognize the partial nature of that protection.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy and the concept of the money multiplier, consider the following statements:**

1.  The money multiplier effect is amplified when commercial banks maintain a higher proportion of their deposits as reserves.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) can influence the money multiplier by adjusting the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The money multiplier effect is inversely related to the reserve requirement ratio. A higher reserve requirement (the proportion of deposits banks are required to keep as reserves) leads to a smaller money multiplier because banks have less money available to lend out, thus limiting the expansion of the money supply.  Statement 2 is correct. The RBI uses the CRR and SLR as tools of monetary policy to influence the money supply. By adjusting these ratios, the RBI directly affects the amount of money commercial banks can lend, thereby impacting the money multiplier.  A higher CRR or SLR reduces the money multiplier, while a lower CRR or SLR increases it. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the relationship between reserve requirements and the money multiplier or the RBI's role in influencing it.


**5. With reference to India's balance of payments, consider the following statements:**

1.  A current account deficit is necessarily financed by a net capital inflow.
2.  Remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are recorded under the capital account of the balance of payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A current account deficit implies that a country is importing more goods and services than it is exporting, resulting in a net outflow of funds. To finance this deficit, the country must attract capital inflows from abroad either through foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, or loans.  Therefore, a current account deficit is always matched by a net capital inflow to maintain balance. Statement 2 is incorrect. Remittances from NRIs are considered private transfers and are recorded under the current account, not the capital account, of the balance of payments.  The current account captures transactions related to the trade of goods and services, while the capital account focuses on capital flows. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misclassify remittances or fail to understand the fundamental relationship between the current account and capital account in financing a deficit.


**6. With reference to India’s monetary policy framework, consider the following statements:**

1. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has the authority to determine all instruments of monetary policy, including the repo rate, reverse repo rate, CRR, and SLR.
2. The primary objective of India’s monetary policy is to maintain price stability, with growth considerations being secondary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MPC determines the repo rate (the key policy rate), it does not have the authority to directly set other monetary policy instruments such as the reverse repo rate, CRR, and SLR. These are managed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) within the overall framework set by the MPC. Statement 2 is correct.  The current monetary policy framework in India prioritizes price stability as its primary objective. While economic growth is a crucial consideration, price stability is seen as a prerequisite for sustainable and inclusive growth.  The inflation target set by the government in consultation with the RBI reflects this priority. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the MPC's powers or the relative importance of price stability and growth in India's monetary policy framework.


**7. With reference to the Indian banking system and monetary policy tools, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) allows scheduled commercial banks to borrow additional overnight funds from the RBI even if their SLR is below the mandated level.
2. The Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) allows banks to deposit unlimited amounts with the RBI at a rate that is always below the repo rate.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MSF acts as a safety valve, enabling banks to borrow funds beyond their usual repo borrowing limits by dipping into their SLR holdings.  Even if their SLR is below the mandated level, banks can still access the MSF.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SDF allows banks to deposit any amount with the RBI on an overnight basis, the rate is typically set at the repo rate or slightly below it. The statement incorrectly states that it's always below the repo rate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of either the MSF or SDF mechanisms.


**8. With reference to instruments of monetary policy employed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. Open Market Operations (OMOs) involve the RBI buying or selling government securities to influence the money supply.
2.  The Bank Rate is currently a frequently used tool for the RBI to directly influence short-term interest rates in the Indian money market.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. OMOs are a crucial tool for the RBI to manage liquidity in the banking system. Buying securities injects money into the system, increasing liquidity, while selling securities withdraws money, reducing liquidity. This directly impacts the money supply and influences interest rates. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bank Rate, while still officially existent, has become largely dormant as a tool for actively managing short-term interest rates since the introduction of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF). The LAF, comprising repo rate, reverse repo rate, and MSF, has become the primary mechanism for influencing short-term interest rates. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the misrepresentation of the current usage of the Bank Rate and the importance of OMOs.


**9. With reference to the Indian Rupee's exchange rate regime, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Rupee operates under a managed float exchange rate system.
2. Under a managed float, the RBI never intervenes in the foreign exchange market to influence the rupee's value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's exchange rate regime is described as a managed float. This means that while the rupee's value is primarily determined by market forces of supply and demand, the RBI does intervene in the foreign exchange market from time to time to manage excessive volatility or to smooth out sharp fluctuations.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The very definition of a *managed* float implies that the monetary authority (in this case, the RBI) does intervene, albeit selectively, to influence the exchange rate.  A free float, in contrast, would involve no intervention.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the nature of India's managed float exchange rate system.


**1. With reference to the impact of US Federal Reserve's monetary policy on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve could lead to capital flight from India.
2. Capital flight from India may reduce the interest cost for Indian firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve typically involves raising interest rates. This makes US assets more attractive to global investors, leading to capital outflow from countries like India where returns might be comparatively lower.  This capital flight can put pressure on the Indian rupee and impact the overall financial stability. The increased attractiveness of US assets draws investment away from emerging markets like India.  This is a crucial aspect of international finance and its impact on developing economies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Capital flight actually increases the interest cost for Indian firms with existing ECBs. When capital leaves India, the demand for the Indian rupee decreases, leading to its depreciation.  Since many ECBs are denominated in foreign currencies (like USD), the Indian firms have to pay more rupees to service the same debt in foreign currency due to the weaker rupee. This increases their borrowing costs and financial burden. The reduced availability of capital in India also makes it more expensive for firms to borrow, regardless of whether they have existing ECBs or not.


**2. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The government can increase coupon rates on its borrowing through IIBs to attract investors during periods of high inflation.
2. IIBs offer investors protection against inflation uncertainty but do not guarantee returns above the inflation rate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The primary advantage of IIBs for the government is that they can *reduce* coupon rates.  Since the principal and interest payments are adjusted for inflation, the government doesn't need to offer high fixed interest rates to compensate for potential inflation erosion of the bond's value. This lowers the government's borrowing costs.  Higher coupon rates would defeat the purpose of inflation-indexed bonds.

Statement 2 is correct. IIBs are designed to protect investors from the risk of inflation eroding the real value of their investment. The principal and interest payments are adjusted based on a pre-determined inflation index. However, this protection doesn't guarantee returns *above* the inflation rate. The investor receives a real return (adjusted for inflation), but this return is still subject to the bond’s inherent interest rate.  The core function of an IIB is to maintain the purchasing power of the investment, not to generate a guaranteed profit beyond inflation.


**3. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) actions in response to economic scenarios, consider the following statements:**

1. If inflation is excessively high, the RBI is likely to sell government securities in the open market.
2. If the Indian rupee is rapidly appreciating, the RBI is likely to intervene by buying foreign currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. High inflation is a signal that there is too much money chasing too few goods. To curb inflation, the RBI would use contractionary monetary policy. Selling government securities in the open market reduces the money supply. This is because when the RBI sells securities, banks buy them, thus reducing the amount of money they have available to lend, ultimately decreasing the money supply and cooling down inflationary pressures. This is a standard tool employed by central banks globally.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  If the Indian rupee is rapidly appreciating, it means its value is rising against other currencies. This makes Indian exports more expensive and imports cheaper, potentially harming the trade balance. In such a scenario, the RBI is more likely to intervene by *selling* foreign currency (and buying rupees) to weaken the rupee and maintain a more competitive exchange rate.  The RBI's aim is typically to maintain a stable, but not necessarily artificially strong, rupee.


**4. With reference to the characteristics of Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Convertible bonds generally offer a higher interest rate compared to non-convertible bonds due to the added option of equity conversion.
2. The conversion feature of convertible bonds provides some protection against inflation for the bondholder.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Convertible bonds typically offer a *lower* interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds. This is because the investor receives the potential upside of equity participation in addition to the interest payments. The lower interest rate reflects the added value of the conversion option.  Investors are willing to accept a lower fixed income return in exchange for the potential for higher returns through equity conversion.

Statement 2 is correct.  While not a direct inflation hedge like an IIB, the conversion feature offers *some* protection against inflation. If the underlying company's performance is positively correlated with inflation (e.g., in an inflationary environment, the company's earnings may increase), the value of the equity the bond can be converted into might also rise, partially offsetting the effects of inflation.  This indirect protection is a key feature that makes convertible bonds attractive to investors concerned about inflation.  The link between company performance and inflation is not guaranteed, but it provides a possible cushion against inflation's impact.


**5. With reference to measures to mitigate a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Increasing government expenditure is a reliable measure to reduce the risk of a currency crisis.
2. Remittances from Indians working abroad contribute to strengthening India's foreign exchange reserves and reducing currency crisis risks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Increasing government expenditure, especially if it's not matched by increased revenue, can actually *increase* the risk of a currency crisis.  Higher government spending can lead to a larger fiscal deficit, requiring more borrowing, which can put pressure on the exchange rate and deplete foreign exchange reserves.  Excessive government spending without sufficient revenue generation can weaken a country's currency and increase its vulnerability to external shocks.

Statement 2 is correct. Remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) represent a significant inflow of foreign currency into India. This strengthens the country's foreign exchange reserves, providing a buffer against external shocks and reducing the vulnerability to currency crises.  A larger pool of foreign exchange reserves gives the RBI more capacity to defend the rupee against depreciation during periods of market stress.  This is a crucial factor in maintaining macroeconomic stability.


**6. With reference to the impact of factors on the demand for a good, consider the following statements:**

1. If a good is an inferior good, an increase in consumer income will lead to a decrease in the market demand for that good.
2. An increase in the price of a complement good will lead to an increase in the market demand for the original good.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. An inferior good is one whose demand falls as consumer income rises. Consumers tend to switch to superior substitutes as their purchasing power increases. This is a fundamental concept in consumer demand theory.  The inverse relationship between income and demand for inferior goods is a key characteristic distinguishing them from normal goods.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Complementary goods are those that are consumed together (e.g., cars and gasoline). An increase in the price of a complement good will typically lead to a *decrease* in the demand for the other good.  If gasoline prices rise sharply, the demand for cars (which require gasoline) may fall as consumers reduce their driving or consider alternative transportation.  The goods are linked, and a price increase in one reduces demand for the other.


**7. With reference to the characteristics of  "Commercial Paper", "Certificate of Deposit", "Call Money", and "Zero-Coupon Bonds" in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds.
2. Certificates of Deposit are long-term instruments issued by scheduled commercial banks to corporations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued primarily by large and creditworthy corporations to raise short-term funds from the money market.  It's a significant instrument in corporate finance for bridging short-term funding gaps.  The unsecured nature means it relies on the issuer's creditworthiness.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term (not long-term) borrowings issued by banks (not necessarily scheduled commercial banks) to individuals and corporations.  They are essentially time deposits that offer a fixed interest rate for a specified period.  While they can be issued by scheduled commercial banks, the description provided in the statement is fundamentally flawed regarding the term and issuer.


**8. With reference to the impact of government policies on the price of rice in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for rice directly influence the market price of rice, often acting as a price floor.
2. Consumer subsidies for rice indirectly influence the market price of rice but do not directly set a price floor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. MSPs act as a price floor, guaranteeing a minimum price to farmers.  This directly impacts the market price, as the government is committed to purchasing rice at the MSP if market prices fall below it. This support mechanism significantly influences the overall price dynamics of rice in India.  The MSP is a key policy tool designed to protect farmers' income.

Statement 2 is correct. Consumer subsidies, while not directly setting a price floor, indirectly affect market prices.  Subsidies lower the effective price paid by consumers, which can lead to increased demand and potentially higher market prices if supply doesn't keep pace.  The indirect influence of subsidies on market prices is a complex interplay of factors including supply elasticity and the extent of the subsidy.


**9. With reference to the "Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana" scheme in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme primarily focuses on providing loans to farmers for purchasing agricultural machinery and inputs.
2.  The scheme aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing them with access to credit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While MUDRA Yojana indirectly supports the agricultural sector by facilitating credit to businesses involved in agriculture-related activities, its primary focus is not on providing direct loans to farmers for purchasing machinery or inputs. The scheme's scope is broader, encompassing various small and micro enterprises.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) aims to promote entrepreneurship among small and micro businesses by providing them with access to credit.  This helps these businesses formalize their operations and participate more fully in the economy.  The scheme is designed to reduce reliance on informal lending sources and boost the formal financial sector's role in supporting MSMEs.


**10. With reference to the  "Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana" (PMFBY) scheme in India, consider the following statements:**

1. PMFBY provides comprehensive crop insurance coverage, including post-harvest losses due to all types of calamities.
2. Under PMFBY, the farmer's premium contribution is fixed, while the remaining premium burden is shared equally by the central and state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMFBY provides comprehensive coverage for various risks, but post-harvest losses are covered only for specific perils (like cyclones and unseasonal rains) and for a limited period. Not all types of calamities are included in the post-harvest coverage.  The scheme's coverage is designed to balance risk mitigation with financial feasibility.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key feature of PMFBY is the fixed farmer's premium contribution. The remaining premium is shared equally by the central and state governments. This ensures predictability for farmers and reduces their financial burden, making crop insurance more accessible. The risk sharing mechanism is crucial for the scheme's success.



**11. With reference to the functioning of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's Foreign Currency Assets (FCA) include investments in US government bonds and deposits with other central banks.
2.  The RBI earns income from its role as the debt manager for both the central and state governments, but this income is not a significant portion of its overall earnings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI's FCA indeed include investments in foreign government securities (like US government bonds) and deposits maintained with other central banks as a part of its foreign exchange reserves management.  These are key components of the RBI's balance sheet and contribute to its foreign exchange reserves.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI's income from its role as debt manager for central and state governments is a significant source of revenue.  The commission earned from managing government debt constitutes a notable portion of the RBI's overall earnings.  This function is a crucial aspect of the RBI's mandate, and the associated revenue is substantial.


**12. With reference to  "American Depository Receipts" (ADRs) and "External Commercial Borrowings" (ECBs) in the Indian context, consider the following statements:**

1. ADRs represent shares of Indian companies listed and traded on US stock exchanges.  The underlying shares are held by a US depository bank.
2. Masala Bonds, a type of ECB, are denominated in Indian rupees and issued outside India.  The currency risk is primarily borne by the Indian borrower.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. ADRs are certificates issued by a US depository bank representing ownership in shares of an Indian company. These ADRs are traded on US exchanges, providing a convenient way for US investors to invest in Indian companies without directly dealing with the Indian stock market.  The depository bank acts as an intermediary, holding the underlying shares.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Masala bonds are denominated in Indian rupees but issued *outside* India.  However, the currency risk is primarily borne by the *investor* (not the Indian borrower).  The investor receives payments in rupees, so they bear the risk of rupee depreciation against their home currency.  The Indian borrower's risk is mitigated as they receive the loan and make repayments in rupees.


**13. With reference to the "Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act" (FRBM Act) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The FRBM Act mandates that the central government's fiscal deficit should not exceed 3% of the GDP in any given year. Any deviation requires explicit parliamentary approval.
2. The FRBM Act explicitly prohibits the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from subscribing to primary issues of central government securities under any circumstances.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The FRBM Act aims to maintain fiscal discipline by setting a target for the fiscal deficit (although the exact percentage might vary slightly depending on amendments).  Significant deviations from this target require parliamentary approval, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in fiscal management.  While there might be flexibility built into the act to accommodate exceptional circumstances, the overall principle of adhering to the deficit target and obtaining parliamentary approval for deviations remains central.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the FRBM Act aims to reduce the RBI's financing of government deficits, it does *not* completely prohibit the RBI from subscribing to primary issues of central government securities. The Act includes an "escape clause" allowing for such subscriptions under specific circumstances, typically related to exceptional economic conditions or emergencies.  The RBI's role in managing government debt is recognized, and the prohibition is not absolute.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on polity and governance aspects related to Indian finance and economy.  Each question follows the specified format and includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Retail Direct Gilt (RDG) scheme allows retail investors to participate in the competitive bidding process for government securities.
2.  Under the RDG scheme, retail investors can purchase Central Government Securities, State Government Securities, and Sovereign Gold Bonds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Retail Direct Gilt (RDG) scheme, while allowing retail investors direct access to the primary and secondary markets for government securities, explicitly states that they *cannot* participate in the competitive bidding process. This is a crucial limitation designed to simplify the process for smaller investors.  The competitive bidding process is generally reserved for larger institutional investors.

Statement 2 is correct. The RDG scheme explicitly permits retail investors to purchase Central Government Securities (Treasury Bills and Dated Securities), State Government Securities (State Development Loans), and Sovereign Gold Bonds. This broadens the investment options available to individual investors and aims to promote financial inclusion.  The scheme's inclusivity is a key policy objective.


**2. With reference to the inclusion of Indian Government securities in Global Bond Indices, consider the following statements:**

1.  Inclusion in Global Bond Indices guarantees that the Indian government will access foreign capital at lower interest rates than domestic markets.
2.  The inclusion necessitates the removal of existing caps on investments by non-resident investors in Indian government securities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, although it needs some nuance. Inclusion in Global Bond Indices significantly increases the likelihood of the Indian government accessing foreign capital at lower interest rates.  Foreign markets generally offer lower interest rates than domestic markets, making it a cheaper source of funding. However, it's not a guaranteed outcome; interest rates are influenced by multiple global factors.  The statement doesn't account for this inherent market volatility.

Statement 2 is correct.  The inclusion of Indian Government securities in Global Bond Indices requires the removal of existing caps on non-resident investment. This is because global index inclusion necessitates unrestricted access for international investors, allowing for a greater influx of foreign capital. The RBI's removal of this cap in March 2020 is a direct consequence of this requirement.


**3. With reference to the corporate bond market in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The slow growth of the corporate bond market in India is primarily due to the lack of transparency and governance standards among corporate entities.
2.  The Indian government's introduction of the "backstop facility" aims to mitigate risks associated with corporate bonds and encourage further investment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage highlights the insufficient transparency and governance standards among many corporate entities as a significant impediment to the growth of the corporate bond market in India. This lack of confidence among investors creates a supply-demand gap. The statement accurately reflects this reality.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian government's "backstop facility," as outlined in the budget 2021-22, is explicitly designed to provide a secondary source of funds for investors in corporate bonds, especially investment-grade securities. This risk mitigation measure aims to bolster investor confidence and stimulate growth in the corporate bond market. The description of the backstop facility accurately reflects its intended function.


**4. With reference to the Indian Financial System, consider the following statements:**

1.  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are permitted to issue cheques drawn on themselves.
2.  Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) are primarily mandated to provide credit and other facilities to the agricultural sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A key distinction between banks and NBFCs is that NBFCs are *not* permitted to accept demand deposits or issue cheques drawn on themselves. This fundamental difference in their operations underscores their distinct regulatory frameworks and roles within the financial system.  The statement directly contradicts this core principle.

Statement 2 is correct. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) were specifically established to cater to the financial needs of the rural economy, with a particular emphasis on agriculture.  Their mandate includes providing credit and other facilities to small and marginal farmers, agricultural laborers, artisans, and small entrepreneurs. The statement accurately reflects the primary objective and function of RRBs.


**5. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and its functions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's primary objective is to maintain price stability, even at the expense of economic growth.
2.  The RBI's regulatory and supervisory functions extend to both banking and non-banking financial institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While price stability is a crucial objective for the RBI, it is not pursued to the exclusion of economic growth. The RBI's mandate involves a balance between maintaining price stability and supporting economic growth.  The statement oversimplifies the complexities of the RBI's monetary policy objectives.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's regulatory and supervisory powers encompass both the banking sector and the non-banking financial institutions (NBFCs). This broad mandate reflects the RBI's role in maintaining the overall stability and integrity of the Indian financial system. The statement accurately reflects the scope of the RBI's regulatory functions.


**6.  With reference to  the concept of  "sterilization" in monetary policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sterilization aims to offset the inflationary effects of large capital inflows by reducing the domestic component of the money supply.
2.  The Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS) was introduced by the RBI as a primary tool for sterilization, primarily using reverse repo operations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sterilization, a crucial aspect of monetary policy, is employed to counter the inflationary pressures that can arise from large capital inflows.  By reducing the domestic money supply through measures like open market operations, the central bank aims to neutralize the expansionary impact of the inflows and prevent excessive inflation. The statement accurately defines the core purpose of sterilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the MSS was indeed introduced to address surplus liquidity from capital inflows, the passage clarifies that it primarily uses the issuance of government Treasury Bills and medium-duration dated securities for liquidity absorption, not reverse repo operations. The statement misrepresents the primary mechanism employed by the MSS.  The use of Treasury Bills and dated securities is a key difference.


**7. With reference to  the balance of payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. A current account deficit necessitates a net capital outflow to maintain BoP equilibrium.
2.  The overall balance of payments deficit (or surplus) is primarily determined by official reserve transactions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A current account deficit implies that a country is spending more on imports than it is earning from exports.  To finance this deficit, the country needs a *net capital inflow*, not outflow. Capital inflows provide the funds necessary to cover the difference between imports and exports. The statement wrongly describes the relationship between current account deficit and capital flows.

Statement 2 is correct. The overall balance of payments is ultimately determined by official reserve transactions. These transactions represent the actions of the monetary authorities (like the RBI) in buying or selling foreign currency to maintain balance.  The change in official reserves reflects the net effect of all other transactions in the BoP. The statement accurately describes the role of official reserve transactions in the BoP.


**8. With reference to  American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  An ADR represents ownership in an Indian company, but the shares are traded on a foreign stock exchange.
2.  Masala Bonds are a type of ECB where the currency risk is borne by the Indian borrower.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. An American Depository Receipt (ADR) is a negotiable certificate issued by a US depository bank representing ownership of shares of a foreign company, in this case, an Indian company.  While the underlying shares are held by the depository bank, the ADRs themselves are traded on US stock exchanges, providing a mechanism for foreign investment in Indian companies. The statement accurately describes the nature and function of ADRs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Masala Bonds are a type of ECB, but the currency risk is borne by the *investor*, not the Indian borrower. This is a key feature differentiating them from other ECBs denominated in foreign currencies. The investor receives payments in Indian Rupees, thus assuming the exchange rate risk.  The statement incorrectly assigns the currency risk.


**9. With reference to currency swaps and forex swaps, consider the following statements:**

1. A currency swap involves an exchange of principal amounts in different currencies between two companies, with the possibility of a pre-agreed exchange rate at maturity.
2.  A forex swap is a transaction conducted solely between the RBI and commercial banks, aimed at managing rupee liquidity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A currency swap involves an agreement between two parties (often multinational corporations) to exchange principal amounts in one currency for another, at the prevailing rate initially and potentially at a pre-agreed rate or the prevailing rate at maturity.  This is used for hedging against currency risks and accessing favorable borrowing rates.  The statement accurately describes the key features of a currency swap.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI does utilize forex swaps, it is not exclusively limited to transactions with commercial banks.  The RBI can also engage in forex swaps with other central banks or international financial institutions to manage foreign exchange reserves and liquidity.  The statement wrongly restricts the scope of forex swaps.


**10. With reference to the GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City), consider the following statements:**

1.  The GIFT City's Domestic SEZ allows transactions only in Indian Rupees.
2.  The GIFT-SEZ (Special Economic Zone) is India's first International Financial Services Centre (IFSC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GIFT City has two zones: a domestic zone and a SEZ (Special Economic Zone).  The Domestic SEZ allows transactions in Indian Rupees, but the IFSC (International Financial Services Centre) within the SEZ operates in foreign currencies. The statement confuses the operational currencies of the different zones.

Statement 2 is correct. The GIFT-SEZ is indeed India's first International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), established under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005.  Its designation as an IFSC allows for transactions in foreign currencies and aims to attract international financial businesses to India. The statement correctly identifies the GIFT-SEZ's unique status.



**1. With reference to the RBI's functions, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI acts as the lender of last resort, providing emergency liquidity assistance to troubled financial institutions only after they have exhausted all market and regular RBI liquidity facilities.
2.  The RBI's currency management function involves solely the design and production of currency notes, leaving distribution entirely to commercial banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The RBI's role as the lender of last resort is crucial for maintaining financial stability.  It intervenes only when other avenues for liquidity are exhausted, protecting depositors and preventing systemic risk. This function is a key element of the RBI's mandate to ensure the stability of the financial system.  The intervention safeguards the banking sector and broader economy from cascading failures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI is responsible for the design and production of currency notes, its currency management function extends far beyond this.  The RBI actively manages the distribution of currency through its Issue Offices, currency chests, and authorized bank branches.  The  RBI's role in maintaining an adequate supply of clean and genuine notes also involves addressing security concerns and implementing measures to prevent counterfeiting.  Therefore, the statement significantly underrepresents the scope of the RBI's currency management function.


**2. With reference to the Economic Capital Framework (ECF) of the RBI, consider the following statements:**

1.  The primary objective of the ECF is to enhance the RBI's ability to manage a macroeconomic crisis by maintaining a substantial capital reserve.
2. The Bimal Jalan Committee recommended that the RBI maintain a contingency risk buffer of 3.5% to 4.5% of its balance sheet.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects one of the two clear objectives of the ECF as outlined in the RBI Act 1934, Section 47. The framework aims to ensure the RBI has adequate funds to handle any financial system crisis, acting as a crucial macroeconomic stabilizer.  This aligns with the RBI's role in maintaining financial stability and its responsibility to act as a lender of last resort.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bimal Jalan Committee, in its recommendations of August 2019, actually suggested that the RBI maintain a contingency risk buffer of 5.5% to 6.5% of its balance sheet, not 3.5% to 4.5%. This difference highlights the importance of precise factual recall in understanding the ECF and its guiding principles. The committee's recommendation reflects a careful assessment of risk and the need for a robust capital buffer.


**3. With reference to Cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), consider the following statements:**

1. Cryptocurrencies are legal tender issued by central banks and are directly exchangeable with fiat currency.
2. A key advantage of CBDCs is their inherent resistance to cyberattacks, unlike existing payment systems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender issued by central banks. They are decentralized digital or virtual currencies, not backed by any government or central bank.  They operate outside the traditional financial system and are not directly exchangeable with fiat currency at a fixed rate.  Their value is determined by market forces and speculation.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While CBDCs offer several advantages, inherent resistance to cyberattacks is not one of them.  CBDC systems, like any digital system, are vulnerable to cyberattacks.  The security of a CBDC depends on robust technological infrastructure, strong cybersecurity measures, and effective risk management strategies.  The statement presents a misleading oversimplification of the complexities of cybersecurity in digital finance.



**4. With reference to the Indian economy's measures to reduce the risk of a currency crisis, consider the following statements:**

1. Increased government expenditure is a significant contributor to reducing the risk of a currency crisis.
2. Remittances from Indians abroad bolster foreign currency reserves, thus mitigating currency crisis risks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Increased government expenditure, particularly if it's not matched by increased revenue, can actually exacerbate currency crisis risks.  It can lead to higher inflation, widening budget deficits, and increased demand for foreign currency, potentially putting downward pressure on the domestic currency's value.  Fiscal prudence and responsible government spending are crucial to managing currency risks.

Statement 2 is correct. Remittances from Indians working abroad represent a significant inflow of foreign currency into the country.  This strengthens the country's foreign exchange reserves, providing a buffer against external shocks and reducing vulnerability to currency crises.  Remittances enhance the resilience of the balance of payments and overall macroeconomic stability.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Government of India's budget:**

1. The Department of Revenue is solely responsible for preparing the Union Budget presented to Parliament.
2.  Parliamentary authorization is required for all disbursements from both the Consolidated Fund of India and the Public Account.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Department of Revenue plays a crucial role in the budget preparation process, it is not solely responsible.  The Union Budget is a collaborative effort involving various ministries, departments, and the Finance Ministry. The Finance Minister ultimately presents the budget to Parliament. The statement oversimplifies a complex process involving numerous stakeholders and inter-departmental coordination.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution of India mandates that no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India without the authorization of Parliament.  Similarly, while the Public Account is not subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as the Consolidated Fund,  Parliamentary control is still exercised over the overall management of public funds, including those in the Public Account. The statement correctly highlights the principle of parliamentary control over public finances.


**6. With reference to the characteristics of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI involves investment in capital instruments of an Indian company, exceeding 10% of its equity capital, while FPI investments are below this threshold.
2.  Both FDI and FPI investments require prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) before they can be made.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  This accurately reflects the key distinction between FDI and FPI in India. FDI signifies a more substantial and long-term investment, often involving active management participation, while FPI represents a more passive investment primarily focused on financial returns. The 10% equity threshold serves as a crucial differentiating factor in classifying foreign investments.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While certain sectors may require government approval for FDI, under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999, an Indian company receiving FDI does not typically require prior RBI approval.  FPI investments, however, may require SEBI approval/license, depending on the specific investment. The statement presents a misleading generalization about the regulatory requirements for both types of investment.


**7. With reference to the effects of devaluation of a currency, consider the following statements:**

1. Devaluation necessarily improves a country's trade balance.
2. Devaluation makes domestic exports more competitive in foreign markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While devaluation can improve a country's trade balance by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive, this is not a guaranteed outcome. The effectiveness of devaluation depends on several factors, including the elasticity of demand for exports and imports, the responsiveness of producers and consumers to price changes, and the actions of other countries.  Other factors can influence the trade balance, so devaluation alone is not a foolproof solution.

Statement 2 is correct. Devaluation makes a country's goods and services relatively cheaper for foreign buyers, thus increasing their competitiveness in the international market.  This is a fundamental principle of international trade and a direct consequence of a weaker domestic currency.  It aims to stimulate export demand and improve the trade balance.


**8.  Consider the following statements related to the  Narasimham Committee reports on financial sector reforms:**

1. The first Narasimham Committee recommended reducing the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) to 25% and phasing out the directed credit program.
2. The second Narasimham Committee recommended that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should not own any banks to avoid potential conflict of interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects recommendations from the first Narasimham Committee (Committee on Financial System).  The committee advocated for a reduction in SLR to enhance the efficiency of the banking system and to lessen its role as a primary source of government financing.  Phasing out the directed credit program was also suggested to promote market-based allocation of credit.

Statement 2 correctly represents a key recommendation of the second Narasimham Committee (Committee on Banking Sector Reforms). The committee recognized the potential conflict of interest inherent in the RBI's ownership of banks and recommended divestment to strengthen the RBI's regulatory role and enhance the autonomy of public sector banks.  This recommendation aimed to improve the governance and efficiency of the banking sector.


**9. With reference to the P.J. Nayak Committee's recommendations on public sector bank governance, consider the following statements:**

1. The committee proposed the establishment of a Bank Investment Company (BIC) to hold the government's stake in public sector banks, reducing government interference.
2. The committee recommended that the Banks Board Bureau (BBB) should be a permanent body to oversee the governance of public sector banks.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a core recommendation of the P.J. Nayak Committee. The committee proposed creating a Bank Investment Company (BIC) as a holding company, separating government ownership from direct management of public sector banks. This aimed to enhance the autonomy of banks and improve their operational efficiency by reducing political interference.  The BIC would manage government shareholding, allowing banks greater independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Nayak Committee recommended establishing the Banks Board Bureau (BBB) as a temporary measure, to be dissolved once the BIC was established. The BBB was intended to improve bank governance in the interim before the more comprehensive structural changes advocated by the committee could be implemented.  The committee did not advocate for a permanent BBB.  The BBB was later replaced by the Financial Services Institutions Bureau (FSIB).


**10. With reference to the sources of revenue for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Interest earned on investments in US government bonds is a significant source of revenue for the RBI.
2.  Seigniorage, derived from the difference between the face value and the cost of printing currency, constitutes a major component of RBI's income.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI invests a portion of its foreign currency assets in various government securities, including US government bonds.  The interest earned on these investments contributes significantly to the RBI's overall revenue stream.  This diversification of investments helps to manage risk and generate returns.

Statement 2 is also correct. Seigniorage is a crucial element of the RBI's revenue. It represents the profit derived from issuing currency – the difference between the face value of the currency and the cost of its production and distribution.  While other factors contribute to the RBI's revenue, seigniorage remains a substantial component.  The statement accurately identifies a key source of income for the central bank.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme primarily aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing collateral-free loans.
2.  A significant portion of the MUDRA Yojana funds are allocated for providing credit to farmers for purchasing agricultural machinery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a scheme launched by the Indian government to provide funding to micro and small businesses.  Its primary objective is to promote entrepreneurship and job creation by facilitating access to credit for small businesses that might otherwise struggle to obtain formal loans.  The scheme emphasizes collateral-free loans, making it easier for individuals with limited assets to secure funding.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this core objective.

Statement 2, however, is inaccurate. While PMMY might indirectly support agricultural activities by providing loans to businesses involved in the agricultural supply chain (e.g.,  small-scale manufacturers of agricultural tools), the scheme's direct focus is not on providing credit specifically for farmers to purchase machinery.  Other government schemes specifically target agricultural mechanization.  The inclusion of this statement acts as a distractor, testing the examinee's precise understanding of the PMMY's mandate.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the scheme's core focus.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI):**

1.  NPCI's primary role is to regulate and supervise the functioning of all commercial banks in India, ensuring compliance with KYC norms and preventing money laundering.
2.  RuPay, a domestic card payment network, was launched by NPCI to promote financial inclusion and reduce reliance on international payment networks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NPCI is an umbrella organization that operates several retail payment systems in India.  Its role is primarily focused on facilitating digital payments, not on regulating banks directly.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the primary regulatory authority for banks in India, responsible for overseeing their compliance with KYC norms and anti-money laundering regulations. Statement 1 incorrectly attributes regulatory functions to NPCI.

Statement 2 is correct. NPCI launched RuPay as a domestic alternative to international card networks like Visa and Mastercard. The aim was to promote financial inclusion by expanding access to digital payment services within India.  This initiative aligns with the government's broader push for digital financial inclusion.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either misattribute functions or fail to recognize the accurate role of NPCI in developing RuPay.


**3. With reference to the "Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme" and "Gold Monetization Scheme," consider the following statements:**

1.  The primary goal of both schemes is to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector, boosting economic growth and foreign exchange reserves.
2.  These schemes aim to reduce India's dependence on gold imports by mobilizing idle gold held by households and channeling it into the formal financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Both the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are initiatives by the Indian government designed to manage the country's gold reserves and reduce reliance on imports.  The schemes encourage individuals to invest in government-backed gold bonds or monetize their existing gold holdings, thereby bringing idle gold into the formal financial system. This reduces the demand for imported gold, improving the country's balance of payments.  Statement 2 accurately captures this central objective.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the schemes might indirectly contribute to economic growth by increasing investment and reducing the current account deficit, their primary objective is not to attract FDI in the gold sector.  The schemes focus on domestic gold mobilization rather than attracting foreign capital.  The inclusion of FDI as a primary goal acts as a significant distractor.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the core purpose of these schemes.


**4. With reference to Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SFBs are primarily established to provide credit to large industrial and corporate entities, filling a gap in the market for large-scale financing.
2.  A key objective of establishing SFBs is to promote financial inclusion by extending credit to small businesses, particularly in rural areas, and to small and marginal farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India were established to address the credit needs of underserved segments of the population.  Their primary focus is on financial inclusion, aiming to reach small businesses, particularly in rural areas, and to small and marginal farmers who traditionally face challenges in accessing formal credit.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this crucial objective.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  SFBs do not cater to large industrial and corporate entities; this is the domain of larger commercial banks.  SFBs focus on micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and the rural economy.  The misleading inclusion of large-scale financing as the primary objective serves as a key distractor. Consequently, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the fundamental role and target clientele of SFBs.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC):**

1. The MPC is a 15-member body comprising representatives from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Ministry of Finance, and other financial institutions, all with equal voting rights.
2. The MPC's primary mandate is to determine the RBI's benchmark interest rates (repo rate) to achieve the inflation target set by the government in consultation with the RBI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is responsible for setting the monetary policy stance in India.  It comprises six members: three from the RBI (including the Governor) and three appointed by the government.  The Governor has a casting vote in case of a tie. Statement 1 is incorrect as it exaggerates the MPC's size and the equal voting rights of all members.

Statement 2 is correct. The MPC's primary function is to decide the repo rate to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth.  The inflation target is set by the government in consultation with the RBI. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the composition and/or the core functions of the MPC.


**6. With reference to "Bitcoins," consider the following statements:**

1.  Bitcoins are issued and regulated by central banks of various countries, ensuring their stability and preventing fraudulent activities.
2.  Bitcoin transactions are typically anonymous, allowing for online payments without either party needing to reveal their identity to the other.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, meaning it is not issued or regulated by any central bank or government.  Its operation relies on blockchain technology and a peer-to-peer network.  Statement 1 is incorrect as it misrepresents the decentralized nature of Bitcoin.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  While Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the public blockchain, the identities of the parties involved are not directly revealed through their Bitcoin addresses.  This feature contributes to a degree of anonymity, though sophisticated techniques can sometimes be used to trace transactions. The statement acts as a plausible distractor by focusing on anonymity while overlooking the public nature of the blockchain.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the core characteristics of Bitcoin.


**7. With reference to the "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1.  MDR is an incentive provided by the government to merchants for accepting digital payments, aiming to promote cashless transactions.
2.  MDR is a charge levied by banks on merchants for accepting payments through debit cards issued by the bank, covering the cost of processing the transaction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a fee charged by banks to merchants for processing card payments.  It covers the costs associated with the transaction, including processing fees, network charges, and other related expenses.  Statement 2 accurately describes the nature of MDR.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While reducing reliance on cash is a policy goal, MDR is not a government incentive but a fee charged by banks.  The statement misrepresents the nature of the fee as a government incentive.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either wrongly attribute the MDR's origin or fail to accurately represent its nature as a processing fee.


**8.  Consider the following statements regarding legal tender money:**

1. Legal tender money refers to any form of money, including cheques, drafts, and electronic transfers, that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of a debt.
2. Legal tender money is specifically defined as metallic currency, such as coins and banknotes, that a creditor is legally compelled to accept for settling debts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Legal tender refers to currency (coins and banknotes) that a creditor must accept as payment for a debt.  The legal definition typically excludes other forms of payment like checks or electronic transfers, which are subject to different legal and contractual arrangements.  Statement 2 correctly defines legal tender money.

Statement 1 is incorrect as it incorrectly broadens the definition of legal tender to include non-currency forms of payment.  The statement acts as a distractor by including plausible but ultimately incorrect forms of payment.  Consequently, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the legally defined scope of legal tender.


**9. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) role, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI manages and services both Government of India securities and State Government securities, ensuring smooth functioning of the government debt market.
2.  Treasury bills are exclusively issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on behalf of the Central Government and State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RBI acts as the debt manager for the Central Government, managing and servicing its securities. However, the RBI does not directly manage State Government securities.  State governments typically manage their own debt issuance and servicing.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the RBI manages the issuance of government securities on behalf of the Central Government, it does not issue treasury bills directly.  Treasury bills are issued directly by the Central Government.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incorrect because they misrepresent the RBI's role in managing government securities and the issuance of treasury bills.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):**

1.  CAR is a regulatory requirement for banks, representing the minimum amount of capital they must hold relative to their risk-weighted assets to absorb potential losses.
2.  Each individual bank determines its own CAR based on its internal risk assessment and profitability goals, without any regulatory oversight.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a regulatory requirement imposed on banks to ensure their financial stability and ability to absorb potential losses.  It dictates the minimum amount of capital a bank must hold relative to its risk-weighted assets.  Statement 1 accurately describes the regulatory nature of CAR.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAR is not determined by individual banks but is set by regulatory bodies like the RBI, based on international standards and risk assessment frameworks.  Banks must meet this minimum requirement.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the regulatory nature of CAR or fail to acknowledge the regulatory oversight in its determination.


**11. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deposits held by customers in the bank are considered a liability of the bank, not an asset.
2.  Advances (loans) given by the bank to borrowers are considered a key asset of the bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

For a bank, deposits represent liabilities because they are funds the bank owes to its depositors.  The bank must repay these deposits upon demand or as per the terms of the deposit.  Loans (advances) are assets because they represent funds that the bank has lent and expects to be repaid with interest.  Statement 1 correctly identifies deposits as liabilities.

Statement 2 is also correct because advances generate income for the bank through interest payments. They are a major component of a bank's balance sheet assets.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to accurately categorize deposits as liabilities and/or advances as assets.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding factors contributing to reducing the risk of a currency crisis in India:**

1.  Increasing government expenditure significantly boosts domestic demand and strengthens the currency, thereby reducing vulnerability to external shocks.
2.  Remittances from Indians working abroad and foreign currency earnings from the IT sector contribute significantly to foreign exchange reserves, bolstering currency stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While government expenditure can influence the economy, simply increasing it doesn't necessarily strengthen the currency or reduce the risk of a currency crisis.  Excessive government spending can lead to inflation and other macroeconomic imbalances, potentially increasing currency vulnerability.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. Remittances and IT sector earnings significantly increase foreign exchange reserves, providing a buffer against external shocks and strengthening the currency.  These inflows help maintain currency stability.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either incorrectly link government expenditure to currency stability or fail to recognize the crucial role of remittances and IT sector earnings in bolstering foreign exchange reserves.


**13. With reference to measures taken by the Government/RBI to stop the slide of the Indian rupee, consider the following statements:**

1.  Following an expansionary monetary policy, by lowering interest rates, makes the rupee more attractive to foreign investors, thereby increasing demand and supporting its value.
2.  Curbing imports of non-essential goods and promoting exports improves the trade balance, reducing pressure on the rupee and supporting its value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

An expansionary monetary policy, characterized by lower interest rates, generally weakens a currency as it makes borrowing cheaper, potentially increasing inflation and reducing the attractiveness of investments in that currency.  Statement 1 is thus incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. Improving the trade balance through measures like import substitution and export promotion reduces demand for foreign currency, supporting the domestic currency's value.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either wrongly link expansionary monetary policy to rupee appreciation or fail to recognize the positive impact of a favorable trade balance on the currency.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the money multiplier in an economy:**

1.  An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) leads to a decrease in the money multiplier, as banks have less money available to lend.
2.  An increase in the population of a country directly leads to a proportional increase in the money multiplier, as more people require access to credit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The money multiplier reflects the extent to which banks can create credit.  A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thus lowering the money multiplier.  Statement 1 correctly describes this inverse relationship.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Population growth does not directly impact the money multiplier.  The multiplier is primarily determined by factors like the CRR, SLR, and the public's propensity to hold cash versus bank deposits.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either incorrectly link population growth to the money multiplier or fail to recognize the inverse relationship between CRR and the money multiplier.


**15. With reference to actions/policies that might give India some immunity to another global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility ensures greater flexibility in managing capital flows and reduces vulnerability to external shocks.
2.  Not depending on short-term foreign borrowings reduces the risk of sudden capital flight during a crisis, improving financial stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While capital account convertibility offers benefits, it can also increase vulnerability to sudden capital outflows during a global crisis.  Full convertibility can make a country more susceptible to speculative attacks.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct.  Relying less on short-term foreign debt reduces the risk of a sudden reversal of capital flows during a crisis.  This reduces the vulnerability of the balance of payments and enhances financial stability. Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either incorrectly link full capital account convertibility to reduced vulnerability or fail to recognize the importance of reducing reliance on short-term foreign debt.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the immediate effect on aggregate money supply when Rs. 1,00,000 is withdrawn in cash from a demand deposit account:**

1. The aggregate money supply decreases by Rs. 1,00,000, reflecting the direct reduction in the money held in bank accounts.
2. The aggregate money supply remains unchanged, as the cash withdrawn from the bank is still circulating within the economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Withdrawing cash from a demand deposit account does not directly reduce the aggregate money supply. The money supply simply changes its form from a deposit in a bank account to physical currency. The total amount of money in circulation remains the same. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct because the cash remains within the economy's monetary base. The aggregate money supply is not immediately affected by the transfer of funds from a bank account to physical currency. Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they fail to recognize that withdrawing cash from a bank account does not reduce the overall money supply in the economy.


**17. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, consider the following purposes for which short-term credit support is provided to farmers:**

1.  Construction of family houses and setting up village cold storage facilities are included as eligible purposes for KCC loans.
2.  Working capital for maintenance of farm assets, post-harvest expenses, and consumption requirements of farm households are covered under the KCC Scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme aims to provide farmers with easy access to credit for various agricultural activities.  The scheme primarily focuses on short-term credit needs related to cultivation, input purchases, and post-harvest management.  Statement 2 accurately reflects these eligible purposes.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  KCC loans are typically not intended for long-term investments like house construction or setting up cold storage facilities.  These would usually be covered under separate government schemes or commercial loans. Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either incorrectly include long-term investment purposes or fail to recognize the KCC's focus on short-term credit for agricultural activities.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding financial instruments in the Indian economy:**

1.  "Commercial Paper" is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds from the market.
2.  "Zero-coupon bonds" are short-term interest-bearing bonds issued by scheduled commercial banks to corporations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by large corporations and financial institutions to raise short-term funds from the money market.  Statement 1 accurately describes this instrument.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Zero-coupon bonds are debt instruments that do not pay periodic interest but are sold at a discount to their face value. They are not typically issued by commercial banks to corporations.  The statement is a distractor, testing the examinee's precise knowledge of zero-coupon bonds.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either mischaracterize commercial paper or incorrectly describe zero-coupon bonds.


**19. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI primarily involves investment made by foreign institutional investors in government securities, contributing to government borrowing.
2. A major characteristic of FDI is that it is a largely non-debt-creating capital flow, representing equity investment in companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) typically involves equity investments in companies, representing ownership and control.  It is not primarily focused on government securities.  Statement 1 is thus incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct.  FDI is a form of capital inflow that does not create debt for the recipient country. It represents equity investment, contributing to the country's capital stock.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either misrepresent the nature of FDI or fail to recognize its non-debt-creating characteristic.


**20. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the President of India based on the recommendations of the Union Finance Minister.
2. The RBI Act provides the RBI with significant autonomy in conducting its monetary policy, although the government retains the power to issue directions in the public interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the Central Government (not the President directly) but the process involves consultation and recommendations.  Statement 1 is therefore slightly inaccurate in its description of the appointment process.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RBI Act grants the RBI considerable autonomy in monetary policy matters, but the government retains the power to issue directions in the public interest, reflecting the balance between autonomy and government oversight. Options (a), (b), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either misrepresent the RBI Governor's appointment process or incorrectly portray the balance between the RBI's autonomy and government oversight.


**21. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. UCBs are supervised and regulated exclusively by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), ensuring uniform standards and practices across the sector.
2. UCBs are permitted to issue equity shares and preference shares to raise capital, similar to other financial institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

UCBs in India are under dual regulation, with the RBI overseeing banking operations and the respective state governments having a role in management-related aspects.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct.  UCBs are allowed to issue both equity and preference shares to raise capital, similar to other financial institutions.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either misrepresent the regulatory framework for UCBs or fail to acknowledge their ability to issue different types of shares.


**22. Consider the following statements regarding factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields:**

1.  Actions of the United States Federal Reserve (US Fed) have a minimal impact on Indian bond yields, as the Indian bond market is largely insulated from global financial conditions.
2.  Inflation and short-term interest rates within India are major factors influencing domestic bond yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Actions of the US Fed, being a major global central bank, significantly impact global financial conditions, including capital flows and interest rate expectations. This indirectly affects Indian bond yields. Statement 1 is thus incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. Domestic factors like inflation and short-term interest rates directly influence the demand for and supply of government bonds, impacting their yields. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either minimize the influence of global factors or fail to acknowledge the direct impact of domestic inflation and interest rates on bond yields.


**23. With reference to instruments that can be included in Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds are generally considered a form of FDI, as they represent a direct investment in a company's equity.
2.  Non-resident external deposits are considered a form of FDI, as they represent foreign investment in the Indian economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency convertible bonds are debt instruments that can be converted into equity, but they are not directly considered FDI. FDI represents direct equity investment, not debt instruments that might later convert to equity.  Statement 1 is thus incorrect.

Non-resident external deposits are short-term investments and not considered FDI. FDI involves long-term investment and a degree of managerial control.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect because they misclassify either foreign currency convertible bonds or non-resident external deposits as FDI.


**24. Consider the following statements regarding the effects of currency devaluation:**

1.  Currency devaluation necessarily improves a country's trade balance by making its exports cheaper and imports more expensive.
2.  Currency devaluation necessarily increases the foreign value of the domestic currency, making it more attractive to foreign investors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While devaluation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, its impact on the trade balance is not guaranteed.  Other factors, such as price elasticity of demand for imports and exports, can influence the outcome.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.

Devaluation, by definition, reduces the value of a currency in relation to other currencies.  It does not increase its foreign value.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect because they make claims about the guaranteed effects of devaluation that may not hold true in practice.


**25. With reference to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following factors:**

1.  Rising interest rates generally increase demand-pull inflation by encouraging borrowing and spending.
2.  Expansionary fiscal policies and increased purchasing power can contribute to demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Rising interest rates generally curb demand-pull inflation as they increase borrowing costs, reducing consumer and investment spending.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. Expansionary fiscal policies (increased government spending) and rising purchasing power can increase aggregate demand, leading to demand-pull inflation.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either incorrectly link rising interest rates to increased demand-pull inflation or fail to recognize the role of expansionary fiscal policies and increased purchasing power.


**26. Consider the following statements about the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s actions in response to macroeconomic conditions:**

1. If inflation is too high, the RBI is likely to sell government securities to reduce money supply and curb inflation.
2. If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to buy dollars in the foreign exchange market to increase demand for the rupee and support its value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

To curb high inflation, the RBI would typically use contractionary monetary policy tools, including selling government securities to reduce the money supply.  This reduces liquidity and helps control inflation. Statement 1 is correct.

If the rupee is depreciating, the RBI would typically intervene by selling dollars from its foreign exchange reserves. This increases the supply of rupees in the market, which is counterintuitive to supporting the rupee's value.  Statement 2 is therefore incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either misrepresent the RBI's response to high inflation or incorrectly describe its intervention in the foreign exchange market during rupee depreciation.


**27. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  IIBs provide investors with protection against inflation risk, as their returns are adjusted based on changes in the inflation rate.
2.  The interest received and capital gains on IIBs are always fully exempt from income tax, making them extremely attractive to investors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from inflation risk.  Their returns are adjusted to reflect changes in the inflation rate, ensuring that the real value of the investment is maintained. Statement 1 correctly describes this key feature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While IIBs offer some tax advantages, the extent of tax exemption may vary depending on the specific terms of the bond and applicable tax laws.  The statement is a distractor, testing the examinee's precise knowledge of the tax implications of IIBs. Options (b), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either incorrectly portray the tax treatment of IIBs or fail to recognize their primary function of providing inflation protection.


**28. Consider the following statements regarding the potential effects of a tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve:**

1. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve can lead to capital flight from emerging markets like India, as investors seek higher returns in the US.
2. Devaluation of the domestic currency reduces the currency risk associated with External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) for Indian firms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A tight monetary policy in the US typically leads to higher interest rates, making US investments more attractive.  This can cause capital flight from emerging markets, as investors move their funds to the US in search of higher returns.  Statement 1 accurately describes this potential effect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a weaker domestic currency can reduce the rupee cost of ECB repayments, it also increases the risk associated with the foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either fail to recognize the impact of US monetary policy on capital flows or misrepresent the relationship between currency devaluation and the currency risk associated with ECBs.


**29. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1.  Convertible bonds typically offer a higher rate of interest compared to non-convertible bonds because of the added option to convert into equity.
2.  The option to convert to equity in convertible bonds provides some degree of protection against inflation for the bondholder.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Convertible bonds usually offer a lower interest rate than non-convertible bonds because the conversion option into equity adds value to the bond.  Investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate in exchange for the potential upside from equity participation.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct.  The conversion option provides a degree of inflation protection because if inflation rises and the company's stock price also increases, the bondholder can benefit from converting the bond into equity at a potentially higher value.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they either misrepresent the interest rate offered on convertible bonds or fail to acknowledge the inflation protection offered by the conversion option.



Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF), consider the following statements:**

1. AHIDF incentivizes investments in dairy and meat processing infrastructure primarily within the public sector.
2. Beneficiaries under AHIDF are required to contribute a minimum of 10% of the project cost as margin money.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AHIDF specifically targets the *private sector* for investments in dairy and meat processing and value addition infrastructure, along with animal feed plants.  The public sector is not the primary focus.

Statement 2 is correct.  The scheme mandates a minimum 10% margin money contribution from eligible beneficiaries (FPOs, MSMEs, Not for Profit Companies, Private Companies, and individual entrepreneurs). The remaining 90% is provided as a loan component from scheduled banks.  The government provides interest subvention to further incentivize participation.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY):**

1.  PMFBY offers a single premium rate for all crops within a given season, regardless of crop type or district.
2. Under PMFBY, the government bears the entire financial burden of the premium, ensuring full insurance cover for farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While there are variations in premium rates between Kharif (2%) and Rabi (1.5%) seasons for food grains, oilseeds, and pulses, the scheme aims for a single rate *within* each season.  Horticulture and cotton crops have higher potential premium rates (up to 5%). However, the emphasis is on simplification and reducing variations compared to previous schemes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  PMFBY fixes the farmer's premium contribution (e.g., 2% for Kharif), but the remaining premium is shared equally by the central and state governments.  This means farmers do not bear the entire cost, and the government's share varies depending on the total premium charged by the insurance company.  The scheme does aim for full insurance cover without capping the sum insured.


**3. With reference to the "Doubling Farmers’ Income" initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative solely focuses on increasing agricultural output to directly enhance farmers' income.
2. The initiative acknowledges that growth in agricultural output does not always translate proportionally into increased farmers' income.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initiative recognizes the limitations of solely focusing on agricultural output.  Farmers' income depends on both output and price.  The initiative aims for a holistic approach, considering factors beyond just increased production, such as improved market access and diversification of income sources.

Statement 2 is correct. The initiative explicitly acknowledges the complex relationship between agricultural output and farmers' income. Price fluctuations and other market dynamics can significantly impact farmers' income even with increased output.  The initiative aims to address these factors to ensure a more robust and equitable increase in farmers' income.


**4. With reference to e-RUPI, consider the following statements:**

1. e-RUPI is a digital virtual currency that can be used for various transactions.
2. e-RUPI vouchers can be transferred to other individuals and converted into cash.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. e-RUPI is explicitly described as a *digital voucher*, not a virtual currency. It's a cashless and contactless payment system designed for specific purposes and beneficiaries, not a general-purpose currency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  e-RUPI vouchers are *person-specific and purpose-specific*. They cannot be transferred to others or converted into cash. This design ensures targeted delivery of benefits and prevents misuse.  The system is intended to improve the transparency and efficiency of welfare programs.


**5.  Consider the following statements concerning the Indian Financial System:**

1. Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs) are permitted to accept demand deposits and issue cheques drawn on themselves.
2. Scheduled commercial banks are required to maintain reserve requirements with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as per the RBI Act, 1934.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A key distinction between banks and NBFIs is that *banks* accept demand deposits, while NBFIs do not.  NBFIs also cannot issue cheques drawn on themselves. This is a fundamental difference in their operational capacity and regulatory framework.

Statement 2 is correct. Scheduled commercial banks, by definition (inclusion in the second schedule of the RBI Act, 1934), are subject to the reserve requirements stipulated by the RBI. This is a crucial aspect of monetary policy and banking regulation in India, ensuring liquidity and stability within the financial system.


**6. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) sources of income, consider the following statements:**

1. A significant portion of RBI's income comes from its investments in US government bonds.
2.  Seigniorage constitutes a major source of RBI's revenue.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  RBI does invest a portion of its Foreign Currency Assets (FCA) in US government bonds, earning interest income. This is part of its overall investment strategy to manage its foreign exchange reserves and generate returns.

Statement 2 is correct. Seigniorage, the difference between the face value of money and the cost of producing it, is a significant source of revenue for central banks, including the RBI.  This is because the RBI's cost of issuing currency (printing and distribution) is substantially lower than its face value.


**7. With reference to the recommendations of the P.J. Nayak Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. The committee recommended that the Government of India should maintain majority shareholding in Public Sector Banks (PSBs).
2. The committee proposed the establishment of a Bank Investment Company (BIC) to manage the government's stake in PSBs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nayak Committee's core recommendation was to *reduce* government control over PSBs to enhance their autonomy and efficiency.  The committee argued that the government's majority shareholding led to governance issues and hampered the banks' performance.  The committee proposed a significant reduction in government ownership.

Statement 2 is correct. The committee advocated for the creation of a Bank Investment Company (BIC) to hold the government's stake in PSBs.  This would allow the government to maintain some ownership while granting operational independence to the banks. The BIC would act as a holding company, separating the government's ownership role from the banks' day-to-day management.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the functions of the Financial Services Institutions Bureau (FSIB):**

1. The FSIB is responsible for recommending candidates for top management positions in only Public Sector Banks (PSBs).
2. The FSIB advises the government on formulating a code of conduct and ethics for directors in PSBs, FIs, and PSIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FSIB's mandate extends beyond PSBs.  It recommends candidates for top management positions in Public Sector Banks (PSBs), financial institutions (FIs), and public sector insurers (PSIs). This broader scope reflects the interconnectedness of the financial sector.

Statement 2 is correct.  The FSIB is tasked with advising the government on establishing and implementing a code of conduct and ethics for directors in PSBs, FIs, and PSIs.  This is crucial for promoting good governance, transparency, and accountability within these institutions.  The FSIB aims to enhance the overall integrity and effectiveness of the financial sector.


**9. With reference to the Narasimham Committee's recommendations on banking sector reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. The committee recommended the complete deregulation of interest rates immediately.
2.  The committee suggested phasing out the directed credit program.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Narasimham Committee recommended a *gradual* deregulation of interest rates, not an immediate and complete deregulation.  A phased approach was considered necessary to avoid disrupting the financial system and to manage the transition effectively.

Statement 2 is correct. The committee recommended phasing out or redefining the directed credit program.  This program mandated banks to lend a certain minimum amount to specific sectors at concessional interest rates.  The committee felt that this program distorted credit allocation and hampered the efficiency of the banking system.  It advocated for a more market-oriented approach to credit allocation.


**10. With reference to the Nachiket Mor Committee's recommendations, consider the following statements:**

1. The committee recommended that every Indian resident above the age of 18 should have a bank account linked to their Aadhaar number.
2. The committee suggested that every resident should be within a 15-minute walking distance from a payment access point.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nachiket Mor Committee strongly advocated for financial inclusion, recommending that every adult Indian should have a bank account. Aadhaar was proposed as a key tool for streamlining account opening and identification, facilitating faster and more efficient financial inclusion.

Statement 2 is correct. The committee emphasized the importance of convenient access to financial services.  It suggested that payment access points should be within easy reach of all residents to enhance the usability and effectiveness of financial services, particularly in rural areas.  This would encourage wider adoption and utilization of banking services.



**1. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. IIBs allow the government to reduce coupon rates on its borrowing.
2. IIBs offer investors protection against inflation uncertainty, but the interest received and capital gains are taxable.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from inflation risk.  Because the principal and interest payments are adjusted based on inflation, the government can offer lower coupon rates than on conventional bonds, making borrowing cheaper.  This is because the real return to the investor remains attractive even with a lower nominal interest rate.

Statement 2 is partially correct but ultimately inaccurate as presented. While IIBs do indeed provide a hedge against inflation uncertainty by adjusting for the changing purchasing power of money, the claim that the interest and capital gains are taxable is incorrect.  The taxability of IIBs can vary depending on the specific features of the bond and the tax laws of the country.  In India, the tax treatment of IIBs may differ from that of other debt instruments.  Therefore, while the inflation protection aspect is accurate, the blanket statement about taxability is not universally true and makes the statement incorrect in its totality for the purpose of a true/false MCQ.


**2. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements about the impact of a tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve:**

1. A tight US monetary policy can lead to capital flight from India.
2.  Capital flight invariably decreases the interest cost for Indian firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve typically involves raising interest rates. This makes US assets more attractive to foreign investors, including those invested in Indian markets.  Consequently, there's a potential outflow of capital from India (capital flight) as investors seek higher returns in the US.  This outflow puts downward pressure on the Indian Rupee and reduces liquidity within the Indian financial system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Capital flight, triggered by a tight US monetary policy, would likely *increase* the interest cost for Indian firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs). This is because the demand for dollars increases (due to capital flight), causing the Rupee to depreciate against the dollar.  Since ECBs are often denominated in dollars, the repayment burden for Indian firms increases when the Rupee weakens, thus raising their interest costs in Rupee terms.


**3. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Convertible bonds always offer a higher interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds due to the added equity option.
2. The conversion option in convertible bonds provides bondholders with some degree of protection against inflation.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Convertible bonds typically offer a *lower* interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds. This is because the investor receives the potential upside of equity appreciation in addition to the interest payments.  The lower interest rate reflects this added benefit.  The lower yield compensates for the risk of the company's stock price falling below the conversion price.

Statement 2 is correct.  The conversion feature of a convertible bond offers a degree of inflation protection. If inflation rises significantly, the underlying equity of the company (into which the bond can be converted) may also increase in value, offsetting some of the erosion in purchasing power caused by inflation. This is because company earnings and valuations are often positively correlated with inflation, at least in the short to medium term.  However, this is not a guaranteed protection, and the degree of protection depends on the performance of the company's stock.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements about demand-pull inflation:**

1. Demand-pull inflation is primarily caused by an increase in aggregate supply exceeding aggregate demand.
2. Expansionary fiscal policies and increased purchasing power are major contributors to demand-pull inflation.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) outpaces aggregate supply (the economy's capacity to produce goods and services).  This excess demand pulls prices upwards.  The statement reverses the cause-and-effect relationship.

Statement 2 is correct. Expansionary fiscal policies, such as increased government spending or tax cuts, boost aggregate demand. Similarly, higher purchasing power, stemming from factors like wage increases or lower interest rates, also leads to increased consumer spending, driving up demand.  This increased demand, when it exceeds the economy's capacity to meet it, results in demand-pull inflation.  Rising interest rates, conversely, are a contractionary measure designed to curb inflation.



**5. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s actions in response to macroeconomic conditions, consider the following statements:**

1. If inflation is excessively high, the RBI is likely to sell government securities in the open market.
2. If the Indian Rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to buy dollars in the foreign exchange market.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  High inflation signifies an excess of money in the economy. To combat this, the RBI uses contractionary monetary policy tools. Selling government securities reduces the money supply, thus curbing inflationary pressures.  This reduces the money available for spending and investment, thus cooling down the economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. If the Rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI would typically *sell* dollars from its foreign exchange reserves to increase the supply of Rupees in the market. This action aims to increase the value of the Rupee relative to the dollar. Buying dollars would further weaken the Rupee. The RBI's intervention aims to stabilize the exchange rate and prevent excessive volatility.


**6. With reference to the functions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a banker's bank, consider the following statements:**

1. Commercial banks maintain a portion of their deposits as reserves with the RBI.
2. The RBI's primary role is to provide loans to commercial banks only during periods of economic recession.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  As a banker's bank, the RBI acts as a central repository for commercial banks. Commercial banks are required to maintain a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves with the RBI (CRR). This requirement helps maintain the stability and liquidity of the banking system.  It also gives RBI control over the money supply.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI does act as a lender of last resort, providing liquidity support to commercial banks during crises, it is not limited to recessions.  The RBI can provide financial support to banks facing liquidity issues at any time, regardless of the overall economic situation, to prevent systemic risk.  The 'lender of last resort' function is a crucial part of maintaining the stability of the financial system.


**7. With reference to the impact of an increase in the demand for money while the money supply remains constant, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in demand for money, with a constant money supply, will lead to a decrease in the interest rate.
2.  Such a situation will result in an increase in the price level (inflation).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. When the demand for money increases, but the supply remains unchanged, there is upward pressure on interest rates. This is because the increased demand for loanable funds (money) creates competition among borrowers, driving up the price of borrowing (interest rate).  This higher interest rate acts as a rationing mechanism, limiting the amount of money available for borrowing and investment.

Statement 2 is correct. If the demand for money increases while the supply remains unchanged, there is increased competition for the limited amount of money.  This increased demand for goods and services (as people try to spend their money), without a corresponding increase in supply, leads to upward pressure on prices, resulting in inflation (price level increase).


**8. With reference to Open Market Operations (OMO) conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. OMOs involve the RBI buying or selling government securities only in the primary market.
2.  Selling government securities during OMOs is a contractionary monetary policy tool used to combat inflation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Open Market Operations (OMO) are conducted in the *secondary* market for government securities. The RBI buys or sells existing securities already in circulation, not newly issued ones (which are sold in the primary market). This allows RBI to directly impact the money supply without waiting for new securities to be issued.

Statement 2 is correct. When the RBI sells government securities, it reduces the money supply in the banking system.  Banks buy the securities using their reserves, thus reducing the money available for lending and consequently reducing aggregate demand. This contractionary policy is a tool used to curb inflation.  This is particularly true when inflation is high.



**9. With reference to the Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The MSS is primarily used to manage liquidity arising from large capital inflows.
2. The MSS involves the RBI directly lending to the government to finance its budget deficits.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS) was introduced in India to manage the impact of large capital inflows on the money supply.  Large capital inflows increase the money supply, potentially leading to inflation and currency appreciation.  The MSS absorbs this excess liquidity by issuing government securities, thus sterilizing the impact of the inflows.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MSS does not directly involve the RBI lending to the government to finance budget deficits.  The MSS operates by issuing short-term government securities (treasury bills) or medium-term dated securities in the market.  The proceeds from this sale are used to absorb excess liquidity and are not used to directly finance government spending.  The government's budget deficit is financed through other means, such as borrowing from the market or through taxation.


**10.  With reference to the Base Rate and Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) systems in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Base Rate system was based on the average cost of funds for banks, while the MCLR system is based on the marginal cost of funds.
2.  Under the MCLR system, banks must link all their lending rates, including those for existing loans, to an external benchmark.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Base Rate system, introduced in 2010, used the average cost of funds as a benchmark for determining banks' lending rates.  The MCLR system, introduced later, shifted to the marginal cost of funds. The marginal cost reflects the cost of raising additional funds, which is often a more sensitive indicator of changes in monetary policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the MCLR system aimed to improve the transmission of monetary policy changes to lending rates, it initially only mandated linking *new* floating-rate loans to an external benchmark (or MCLR).  Existing loans were not immediately required to be linked to this external benchmark.  Only later did the RBI mandate linking all new floating rate personal or retail loans and floating rate loans to MSMEs to an external benchmark.  This was done to improve the speed of monetary policy transmission.


**1. With reference to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing prices of identical baskets of goods and services across different nations, adjusting for differences in cost of living.
2.  India's ranking as the world's sixth-largest economy is consistently higher when measured using PPP than when using nominal exchange rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It aims to determine the relative value of currencies by comparing the prices of identical goods and services in different countries, adjusting for variations in purchasing power and cost of living.  A higher PPP value for a country suggests its currency has greater purchasing power than its nominal exchange rate indicates.

Statement 2 is also correct.  India's economic size, when assessed using PPP, generally surpasses its ranking based on nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is because PPP accounts for the lower cost of goods and services in India compared to many developed nations.  The difference between nominal GDP and PPP-adjusted GDP highlights the disparity in purchasing power between countries.  While India's nominal GDP might place it lower globally, its PPP-adjusted GDP often places it significantly higher, reflecting the relative affordability of goods and services within the country.  Therefore, India's higher ranking when using PPP is a consistent observation.


**2. With reference to the Indian economy's growth indicators, consider the following statements:**

1.  A sustained increase in both absolute and per capita real Gross National Product (GNP) automatically signifies enhanced economic development.
2.  High savings rates alone guarantee substantial increases in output and economic progress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While growth in absolute and per capita real GNP indicates economic expansion, it doesn't automatically translate to improved economic development.  Economic development encompasses broader aspects like poverty reduction, improved human capital, infrastructure development, environmental sustainability, and equitable distribution of wealth.  High GNP growth can coexist with persistent poverty, unemployment, and inequality, thus failing to reflect genuine economic development.  Factors like income distribution, social progress, and environmental impact are crucial for assessing true economic development.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. High savings rates are essential for investment and capital formation, but they don't automatically lead to significant output increases. The efficiency of capital utilization and investment allocation play a critical role.  High capital-output ratios (meaning a large amount of capital is needed to produce a unit of output), inefficient resource allocation, or a lack of technological advancement can negate the positive effects of high savings.  Other factors, such as technological progress, institutional quality, and human capital, are also crucial determinants of output growth.


**3. With reference to Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPI assigns a higher weighting to food items compared to the WPI.
2. The WPI is a more comprehensive measure of inflation, encompassing changes in service sector prices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CPI, designed to reflect the cost of living for consumers, gives significant weight to food items because they constitute a substantial portion of household expenditure, particularly for lower-income groups. The WPI, on the other hand, tracks prices at the wholesale level and gives less emphasis to food items, focusing on a broader range of goods traded in wholesale markets.  This difference in weighting stems from the differing objectives of the two indices – CPI focuses on consumer cost of living, while WPI tracks wholesale price changes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WPI primarily focuses on the prices of goods traded in wholesale markets and does not comprehensively capture changes in service sector prices.  The service sector constitutes a significant portion of many modern economies, and its price changes are crucial for measuring overall inflation.  The CPI, however, incorporates the prices of services, offering a more complete picture of inflation affecting consumers.  Therefore, the CPI is a more inclusive measure of inflation than the WPI, especially in economies with a substantial service sector.


**4. With reference to the factors affecting market demand, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the price of a substitute good leads to a decrease in the demand for the original good.
2. An increase in the price of a complementary good leads to an increase in the demand for the original good.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of another. When the price of a substitute good increases, consumers are more likely to switch to the relatively cheaper original good, thereby increasing its demand. This is a fundamental principle of demand theory; the price of substitutes directly impacts the demand for the good in question.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Complementary goods are those that are consumed together. If the price of a complementary good rises, the demand for the original good will likely decrease because consumers will reduce their consumption of both goods due to the increased overall cost.  The price of complementary goods has an inverse relationship with the demand for the goods in question.


**5.  With reference to the Indian economy and exchange rates, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) implies a depreciation of the Indian Rupee.
2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) signals a deterioration in India's trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NEER measures the value of the Rupee against a basket of other currencies. An increase in NEER indicates that the Rupee has appreciated (become stronger) against this basket of currencies, not depreciated.  A higher NEER means it takes more units of foreign currencies to buy one Rupee.

Statement 2 is correct. REER adjusts the NEER for changes in relative price levels between India and its trading partners. An increase in REER implies that Indian goods have become relatively more expensive compared to those of its trading partners. This makes Indian exports less competitive and imports more attractive, thus leading to a deterioration in India's trade competitiveness.  Therefore, a rise in REER is a negative indicator for India's export-oriented industries.


**6. With reference to the Indian economy and inflation, consider the following statements:**

1. Demand-pull inflation is exacerbated by expansionary fiscal policies and increased purchasing power.
2. Rising interest rates are a typical response of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to curb demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Demand-pull inflation arises when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply. Expansionary fiscal policies (increased government spending or tax cuts) boost aggregate demand, contributing to inflationary pressures. Similarly, increased purchasing power, resulting from higher incomes or lower interest rates, also fuels demand and can exacerbate inflation.

Statement 2 is also correct. Rising interest rates are a common monetary policy tool used by central banks, including the RBI, to combat demand-pull inflation. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs, discouraging investment and consumption, thereby reducing aggregate demand and controlling inflationary pressures.  This is a standard macroeconomic policy response to inflationary pressures driven by excessive demand.


**7. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) actions and their impact, consider the following statements:**

1. To counter high inflation, the RBI is likely to purchase government securities in the open market.
2.  If the Indian Rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to intervene by buying dollars in the foreign exchange market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  To combat high inflation, the RBI typically employs contractionary monetary policies.  One such policy is to sell government securities in the open market, thereby reducing the money supply and curbing inflation. Buying government securities would increase the money supply, potentially worsening inflation.

Statement 2 is correct.  A rapidly depreciating Rupee indicates a weakening of the currency. To support the Rupee, the RBI would likely intervene in the foreign exchange market by selling dollars from its foreign exchange reserves. This increases the supply of dollars, potentially increasing the demand for Rupees and thus helping to stabilize or appreciate the Rupee's value.  This is a standard intervention strategy used by central banks to manage exchange rate volatility.


**8. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. IIBs enable the government to reduce coupon rates on its borrowings.
2. IIBs shield investors from inflation risk by adjusting returns based on inflation rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  IIBs offer a crucial advantage to governments by allowing them to offer lower coupon rates (interest payments) on their bonds.  Since the principal and interest payments on IIBs are adjusted for inflation, investors are compensated for inflation risk, making these bonds attractive even at lower coupon rates. This reduces the government's borrowing costs.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The primary benefit of IIBs is their inflation protection.  The principal and interest payments on IIBs are linked to an inflation index, usually the CPI.  This means that as inflation rises, the value of the bond's payments increases proportionally, protecting investors from the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation. This feature makes IIBs particularly appealing to risk-averse investors concerned about inflation.


**9. With reference to the impact of US Federal Reserve's monetary policy on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve can lead to capital flight from emerging markets like India.
2. Capital flight increases the interest rate burden on Indian firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (e.g., raising interest rates) typically increases the attractiveness of US dollar-denominated assets.  This can lead to capital flight from emerging markets like India, as investors shift their funds to higher-yielding US assets, seeking better returns and reduced risk.  This capital outflow can put downward pressure on the Rupee and impact the Indian economy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  If capital flows out of India due to a tight US monetary policy, it can make it more expensive for Indian firms to service their existing ECBs.  This is because the Rupee might depreciate against the dollar, increasing the cost of repaying dollar-denominated loans.  The increased repayment burden can strain the financial health of these firms.


**10. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Convertible bonds typically offer lower interest rates compared to traditional bonds due to the option to convert them into equity.
2. The equity conversion feature in convertible bonds provides investors with a degree of protection against inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Convertible bonds offer a lower interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds because they provide an additional benefit to the investor – the option to convert the bond into equity shares of the issuing company. This option adds value and compensates for the lower interest rate.  Investors are willing to accept a lower yield in exchange for the potential upside from equity participation.

Statement 2 is also correct. While not a direct inflation hedge like an inflation-indexed bond, the equity conversion feature offers some protection against inflation.  If the issuing company performs well and its stock price rises due to inflation or other factors, the investor can convert their bond into equity, benefiting from the increased stock value.  This provides a degree of indirect inflation protection, though not a guaranteed one.  The potential for capital gains from equity participation partially offsets inflation risk.



**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMMY primarily aims to provide collateral-free loans to farmers for purchasing agricultural equipment.
2.  The scheme facilitates access to institutional credit for micro and small enterprises, thereby promoting financial inclusion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a flagship scheme of the Indian government aimed at providing funding to micro and small enterprises (MSEs).  Statement 2 accurately reflects this core objective.  The scheme's primary goal is to bring these businesses into the formal financial system, offering them easier access to credit without stringent collateral requirements. This promotes financial inclusion by extending credit to entities often excluded from traditional banking channels.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMMY might indirectly benefit some farmers who are also MSE owners (e.g., small-scale agricultural businesses), the scheme's focus is not specifically on providing loans to farmers for agricultural equipment.  Other government schemes cater specifically to agricultural credit needs.  The emphasis on MSEs distinguishes PMMY from purely agricultural credit initiatives.  Therefore, only statement 2 correctly describes the PMMY's purpose.


**2. With reference to the "Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme" and "Gold Monetization Scheme," consider the following statements:**

1. Both schemes aim to increase foreign direct investment (FDI) in India's gold and jewelry sector.
2. A primary objective of these schemes is to mobilize idle gold held by households into the formal financial system, thereby reducing reliance on gold imports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are initiatives designed to address India's substantial gold holdings within households and its dependence on gold imports. Statement 2 correctly highlights the core objective: to bring idle gold into the formal economy. By encouraging individuals to invest in bonds or monetize their gold holdings, these schemes aim to reduce demand for imported gold, bolstering the country's foreign exchange reserves and decreasing the balance of payments deficit.  Statement 1 is inaccurate.  While these schemes might indirectly impact FDI in the gold sector by improving market transparency and liquidity, their primary focus isn't on attracting FDI. The schemes primarily aim to improve domestic resource mobilization and reduce reliance on imports.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the primary goals of these schemes. The attraction of FDI is a secondary, less direct, consequence.


**3. With reference to Bitcoins, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bitcoin transactions are fully anonymous, ensuring complete privacy for all parties involved.
2.  Bitcoins are not tracked by any central bank or government authority; they operate outside the purview of conventional financial systems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, operates on a decentralized blockchain technology, making it largely independent of central banks and government regulation. This is reflected in the correctness of statement 2.  While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous (identities are not directly revealed but linked to addresses), they are not entirely anonymous. Blockchain technology records transaction details, which can be analyzed to trace certain aspects of the transaction history.  This makes statement 1 incorrect.  While Bitcoin offers a higher degree of privacy than traditional banking systems, it is not entirely anonymous.  Sophisticated tracking methods and blockchain analysis can reveal information about Bitcoin transactions, especially when large amounts are involved. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a key characteristic of Bitcoin.


**4. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1. NPCI's primary function is to regulate and supervise the activities of all commercial banks in India.
2. NPCI has played a significant role in promoting financial inclusion through initiatives like the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is an umbrella organization that facilitates retail payments in India.  Statement 2 accurately describes NPCI's contribution to financial inclusion.  NPCI's initiatives, most notably the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), have significantly broadened access to digital payment systems for a wider population, including those previously excluded from formal banking.  This has democratized access to financial services, boosting financial inclusion.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  NPCI's role is not to regulate and supervise commercial banks.  That function primarily falls under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). NPCI functions as a facilitator of payment systems, not a regulator of financial institutions.  Thus, only statement 2 is correct.


**5. With reference to Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. SFBs are primarily intended to cater to the financial needs of large corporations and multinational companies.
2. A key objective of establishing SFBs is to extend credit to underserved segments such as small businesses, small and marginal farmers, and micro and small enterprises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Small Finance Banks (SFBs) are a type of bank in India specifically designed to serve the financial needs of underserved populations and sectors. Statement 2 accurately describes their purpose.  SFBs are intended to provide credit and other financial services to small businesses, small and marginal farmers, and micro-enterprises, which typically have limited access to formal banking channels. This aligns with the government's broader financial inclusion agenda.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  SFBs are not aimed at large corporations or multinational companies.  Large businesses have access to a variety of other banking and financial services.  The niche role of SFBs is to serve the credit needs of smaller entities, filling a significant gap in the existing financial ecosystem.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1. MDR is a fee charged by the government to merchants for accepting digital payments.
2. MDR represents a charge levied by banks on merchants for accepting payments through their debit or credit cards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a fee that merchants pay to banks for processing card payments.  Statement 2 accurately describes this.  When a customer uses a debit or credit card to make a purchase, the merchant incurs a small fee (MDR) to cover the transaction processing costs borne by the acquiring bank.  This fee compensates the bank for its services in facilitating the electronic payment.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  The government does not directly charge merchants an MDR.  The MDR is a fee determined and collected by banks and payment processors. While the government might influence MDR through policy (e.g., incentives to reduce MDR for certain types of transactions), it is not the direct collector of this fee.  Thus, only statement 2 correctly defines MDR.


**7. With reference to "legal tender money," consider the following statements:**

1. Legal tender money refers exclusively to metallic coins in circulation within a country.
2. Legal tender money is currency that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of a debt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Legal tender refers to currency that a creditor must accept as payment for a debt. Statement 2 accurately reflects this definition.  The legal tender status of money is conferred by law, obligating creditors to accept specific forms of currency in settling financial obligations.  This ensures that the currency is widely accepted and maintains its value as a medium of exchange.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  Legal tender includes not only metallic coins but also banknotes issued by the central bank.  The definition encompasses all forms of currency designated by law as acceptable for discharging debts.  Thus, only statement 2 provides the correct definition of legal tender money.


**8. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) role in managing government securities, consider the following statements:**

1. RBI manages and services both Central and State Government securities.
2.  Treasury bills are issued only by the Central Government, not by State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plays a crucial role in managing government securities, but its involvement differs between Central and State Government securities. Statement 2 correctly states that treasury bills are primarily issued by the Central Government.  State Governments may issue other types of securities, but treasury bills are typically a Central Government instrument used for short-term borrowing.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While RBI manages and services Central Government securities extensively, its role in managing State Government securities is less direct and comprehensive.  State Governments often manage their own securities or utilize other intermediaries.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the RBI's role regarding treasury bills.


**9. With reference to the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), consider the following statements:**

1. CAR is determined by each individual bank based on its internal risk assessment.
2. CAR represents the amount of capital a bank must maintain to absorb potential losses from borrowers' defaults.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a crucial regulatory requirement for banks to maintain financial stability.  Statement 2 correctly describes CAR's purpose: to ensure banks have sufficient capital to cover potential losses arising from non-performing assets (NPAs) or defaults by borrowers.  This acts as a buffer to absorb shocks and prevent bank failures.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While banks conduct internal risk assessments to inform their capital planning, the CAR itself is not determined solely by each bank.  Regulatory authorities like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) set minimum CAR requirements that all banks must meet.  Banks must maintain a CAR above the prescribed minimum, but the minimum itself is a regulatory mandate, not a bank-specific determination. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**10. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Deposits held by customers constitute a major asset of a commercial bank.
2. Advances (loans) extended to borrowers are considered assets for a commercial bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Commercial banks' balance sheets categorize assets and liabilities differently.  Statement 2 is correct; advances (loans) are a significant asset for a commercial bank.  When a bank lends money, this becomes an asset on its balance sheet – a claim on the borrower's future repayment.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  Deposits held by customers are liabilities for a commercial bank, not assets.  They represent the bank's obligations to its depositors.  The bank uses these deposits to generate assets (through lending and investments).  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately classifies a commercial bank's assets.


**11. With reference to factors contributing to reducing currency crisis risk in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Increasing government expenditure consistently contributes to mitigating currency crisis risks.
2. Remittances from Indians working abroad and foreign currency earnings from the IT sector strengthen India's foreign exchange reserves, reducing currency crisis vulnerability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A country's vulnerability to currency crises is influenced by various factors, including the strength of its foreign exchange reserves and the stability of its current account. Statement 2 accurately identifies two key factors reducing India's currency crisis risk.  Remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and foreign exchange earnings from the IT sector contribute substantially to India's foreign exchange reserves.  Strong reserves provide a buffer against external shocks and help stabilize the currency during periods of volatility.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While government expenditure can stimulate economic growth, consistently increasing it without corresponding increases in revenue can lead to higher fiscal deficits and potentially weaken the currency, increasing vulnerability to a currency crisis.  Uncontrolled government spending can put pressure on the currency, making it more susceptible to external shocks. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes factors that reduce currency crisis risk.


**12. With reference to measures taken by the Government/RBI to prevent the slide of the Indian rupee, consider the following statements:**

1. Following an expansionary monetary policy is a common measure to counter rupee depreciation.
2. Curbing imports of non-essential goods and promoting exports are usually adopted to improve the balance of payments and support the rupee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

When the Indian rupee depreciates, the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) employ various measures to stabilize the currency.  Statement 2 correctly describes a common approach: managing the balance of payments through import controls and export promotion.  Curbing non-essential imports reduces the demand for foreign currency, while increasing exports generates more foreign exchange earnings, both supporting the rupee's value.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  An expansionary monetary policy, which increases the money supply, is generally not used to counter rupee depreciation.  Expansionary policies tend to weaken the currency further by increasing inflation and reducing investor confidence.  Contractionary monetary policies are more often used to stabilize the currency during times of depreciation.  Therefore, only statement 2 identifies a typical measure used to address rupee depreciation.


**13. With reference to the money multiplier in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) leads to a higher money multiplier.
2. Increased banking habits among the population tend to increase the money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The money multiplier reflects the extent to which an initial injection of money into the banking system can lead to a larger expansion of the overall money supply.  Statement 2 is correct.  When more people utilize banking services and deposit their funds, it increases the amount of money available for banks to lend, thus increasing the money multiplier effect.  Increased deposits provide banks with more resources to lend, amplifying the money creation process.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  An increase in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), which mandates banks to hold a certain percentage of their deposits in liquid assets, reduces the amount of money available for lending. This reduces the money multiplier because less money is available for banks to lend out and create new money. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes a factor that increases the money multiplier.


**14. With reference to actions/policies that might provide immunity to India during a global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1. Maintaining full capital account convertibility is crucial for resilience during global financial crises.
2. Reducing dependence on short-term foreign borrowings minimizes vulnerability to sudden capital flight.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A country's resilience during a global financial crisis depends on its financial structure and its ability to withstand external shocks. Statement 2 is correct.  Reducing dependence on short-term foreign borrowings is a key strategy for mitigating vulnerability during crises.  Short-term debt is susceptible to sudden capital flight when global investor sentiment turns negative.  This can lead to a rapid depletion of foreign exchange reserves and destabilize the economy.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While capital account convertibility can foster economic integration, it also increases susceptibility to external shocks during crises.  Full convertibility exposes an economy to rapid capital inflows and outflows, which can be destabilizing during periods of global uncertainty. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately identifies a measure that enhances resilience during a global financial crisis.


**15. With reference to the immediate effect of a large cash withdrawal from a demand deposit account, consider the following statements:**

1. The aggregate money supply in the economy increases by more than the amount withdrawn.
2.  The immediate effect on aggregate money supply is a reduction equal to the amount withdrawn.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

When a significant amount of cash is withdrawn from a demand deposit account, the immediate impact on the money supply is a direct reduction of that amount. Statement 2 correctly captures this.  The money supply is reduced because the money moves from the deposit form (M1 or M3) to cash form (currency with the public). The total amount of money in the economy remains the same, but the composition changes.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  The money supply does not increase because the money is merely shifting forms; it doesn't create new money.  The money multiplier effect is a longer-term phenomenon, not an immediate consequence of a cash withdrawal.  The immediate impact is a direct decrease in the money supply equivalent to the amount withdrawn. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**16. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. KCC provides short-term credit for consumption requirements of farm households and construction of family houses.
2. KCC offers short-term credit support for working capital needs related to farm operations and post-harvest expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme is designed to provide timely credit support to farmers for their agricultural activities. Statement 2 accurately reflects this.  KCC primarily aims to provide short-term credit for meeting working capital needs (inputs, labor) and post-harvest expenses (storage, transportation). This ensures farmers have the necessary funds throughout the agricultural cycle.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While KCC might indirectly support household needs to some extent (by enabling the farmer to generate income), its primary focus is on agricultural operations, not direct household consumption or investments like house construction.  Other government schemes address those needs specifically.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the KCC's purpose.


**17. With reference to financial instruments in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. Commercial Paper is a long-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations.
2. Call money is a short-term borrowing instrument primarily used for interbank transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian financial market utilizes various instruments for short-term and long-term borrowing. Statement 2 accurately describes call money: a short-term borrowing instrument used mainly for interbank transactions.  Banks use call money to manage their short-term liquidity needs.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term unsecured promissory note, not a long-term instrument.  CP is typically issued by large corporations for short-term funding needs.  The maturity period is relatively short (typically less than one year). Thus, only statement 2 provides a correct description.


**18. With reference to the characteristics of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI primarily involves debt-servicing obligations for the recipient country.
2. FDI is largely a non-debt creating capital flow, representing equity investment in a company.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a significant source of capital inflow for many countries, including India.  Statement 2 accurately describes a key characteristic of FDI: it is primarily a non-debt creating capital flow. FDI typically involves equity investment, representing ownership stakes in companies.  This is different from debt financing, which creates debt obligations for the recipient country.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  FDI does not primarily involve debt-servicing.  Debt-servicing is associated with debt financing, not equity investments like FDI.  FDI represents ownership and participation in a company's profits, not repayment of debt.  Therefore, only statement 2 correctly characterizes FDI.


**19. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the President of India based on the recommendations of a search-cum-selection committee.
2. The RBI Act grants the Central Government the power to issue directions to the RBI in matters of public interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is India's central bank, with its governance structure defined by the RBI Act. Statement 1 is partially correct. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the Central Government, not the President, based on recommendations from a search committee.  Statement 2 is correct. The RBI Act allows the Central Government to issue directions to the RBI in matters of public interest.  This provision ensures that the RBI's actions align with national priorities, particularly in exceptional circumstances. While the RBI enjoys operational autonomy, the government retains the power to intervene in situations of national interest. Thus, both statements are partially correct; however, statement 1 is slightly inaccurate regarding the appointing authority.


**20. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. UCBs are exclusively supervised and regulated by local boards established by the respective State Governments.
2. UCBs have the authority to issue both equity shares and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) operate under a specific regulatory framework in India. Statement 2 is correct.  UCBs are authorized to issue both equity shares and preference shares as part of their capital structure.  This allows them to raise capital from various sources to support their operations.  Statement 1 is incorrect. UCBs are not solely supervised and regulated by local boards set up by State Governments.  While State Governments play a role in their oversight,  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also has significant regulatory powers over UCBs, especially concerning their financial soundness and adherence to banking regulations.  The RBI's increased regulatory oversight reflects the importance of maintaining stability within the banking sector.  Therefore, only statement 2 is fully accurate.


**21. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following statements:**

1. Actions of the United States Federal Reserve (US Fed) have minimal impact on Indian Government Bond Yields.
2. Inflation rates and short-term interest rates within India significantly influence Government Bond Yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Government bond yields are influenced by several domestic and international factors. Statement 2 is correct.  Inflation and short-term interest rates are key determinants of government bond yields within a country.  Higher inflation typically leads to higher yields as investors demand a higher return to compensate for the erosion of purchasing power.  Similarly, rising short-term interest rates tend to push up longer-term yields.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  The actions of the US Federal Reserve (the US central bank) significantly impact global financial markets, including Indian government bond yields.  Changes in US interest rates affect global capital flows and investor sentiment, influencing demand for Indian government bonds and consequently their yields.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately identifies key domestic factors impacting Indian government bond yields.


**22. With reference to components of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), consider the following statements:**

1. Non-resident external deposits are considered a form of Foreign Direct Investment.
2.  Foreign currency convertible bonds are included under Foreign Direct Investment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has specific criteria for its classification.  Both statements are incorrect.  Non-resident external deposits are not considered FDI; they represent debt instruments, not equity investments. FDI involves equity ownership or direct control in a company.  Similarly, foreign currency convertible bonds are debt instruments, not equity investments, and therefore not classified as FDI. FDI is characterized by long-term equity investments, management control, and a significant ownership stake.  Debt instruments, even if issued by foreign entities to Indian companies, do not meet the criteria for FDI.  Therefore, neither statement accurately describes components of FDI.


**23. With reference to the effects of currency devaluation, consider the following statements:**

1. Devaluation invariably leads to an improvement in the trade balance.
2. Devaluation enhances the competitiveness of domestic exports in foreign markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Currency devaluation, where a country's currency is officially lowered in value against other currencies, has several potential effects. Statement 2 is correct.  Devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers, increasing their competitiveness in international markets.  This can lead to an increase in export volumes.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While devaluation can improve a country's trade balance by boosting exports, it is not a guaranteed outcome.  The effect on the trade balance depends on various factors, including the elasticity of demand for exports and imports, the response of domestic producers to increased demand, and global market conditions.  Devaluation can also increase the cost of imports, potentially offsetting some of the export gains. Therefore, only statement 2 describes a consistent outcome of devaluation.


**24. With reference to factors that can cause or increase demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. Rising interest rates directly contribute to demand-pull inflation.
2. Expansionary government policies and increased purchasing power among consumers are significant contributors to demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply, leading to a rise in the general price level. Statement 2 correctly identifies key factors contributing to demand-pull inflation.  Expansionary government policies (e.g., increased government spending) can boost aggregate demand, as can increases in consumer purchasing power.  Increased demand without a corresponding increase in supply leads to upward pressure on prices. Statement 1 is incorrect. Rising interest rates generally act to curb inflation, not cause it. Higher interest rates reduce borrowing and investment, thus dampening aggregate demand and mitigating inflationary pressures.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes factors that contribute to demand-pull inflation.


**25. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) responses to macroeconomic conditions, consider the following statements:**

1. If inflation is high, the RBI is likely to buy government securities to increase money supply.
2. If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to sell dollars in the market to increase the supply of dollars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses various monetary policy tools to manage macroeconomic conditions. Statement 1 is incorrect.  If inflation is high, the RBI would typically *sell* government securities (through open market operations) to reduce the money supply, thereby curbing inflationary pressures.  Buying securities would have the opposite effect, increasing money supply and potentially exacerbating inflation.  Statement 2 is correct.  If the rupee is depreciating rapidly, the RBI might intervene in the foreign exchange market by selling dollars from its reserves.  This increases the supply of dollars, potentially supporting the rupee's value and mitigating the depreciation. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the RBI's typical response to these situations.


**26. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. The interest received on IIBs is tax-exempt, providing investors with complete tax relief.
2. IIBs offer investors protection against inflation risk by adjusting returns based on inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to mitigate the impact of inflation on investors' returns. Statement 2 is correct. IIBs adjust their principal and interest payments according to changes in the inflation rate.  This protects investors from the erosion of their purchasing power due to inflation.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While some aspects of IIB returns might have tax advantages depending on specific tax laws, the interest received is not entirely tax-exempt. Tax implications vary depending on the specific features of the bond and applicable tax regulations.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the core characteristic of IIBs.


**27. With reference to the potential effects of a tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, consider the following statements:**

1. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve is unlikely to cause capital flight from emerging markets like India.
2.  Capital flight from India, triggered by a US Federal Reserve's tight monetary policy, can increase borrowing costs for Indian firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (raising interest rates) can have global implications. Statement 1 is incorrect. A tight US monetary policy often leads to capital flight from emerging markets like India.  Investors seek higher returns in the US, leading to capital outflows from countries with lower interest rates.  Statement 2 is correct.  Capital flight caused by a US rate hike can significantly increase borrowing costs for Indian firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).  The rupee may depreciate against the dollar, making it more expensive for Indian firms to repay their ECBs denominated in dollars.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes a potential consequence of a US Federal Reserve's tight monetary policy.


**28. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Because convertible bonds offer the option to convert to equity, they typically pay a higher interest rate than non-convertible bonds.
2. The conversion option in convertible bonds provides some degree of inflation protection for the bondholder.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Convertible bonds are debt instruments with an embedded option for the bondholder to convert them into equity shares of the issuing company.  Statement 1 is incorrect. Convertible bonds generally pay a lower interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds.  This is because the conversion option provides additional value to the bondholder, reducing the need for a high interest rate.  Statement 2 is correct. The conversion option offers some protection against inflation.  If the company's equity performs well (often driven by inflation), the bondholder can benefit by converting to equity, potentially offsetting inflation's effects on the bond's fixed income. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes a characteristic of convertible bonds.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) designates banks with asset sizes exceeding 2% of the GDP as Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs).
2.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) designates Domestically Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) based on the value of assets under management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI indeed identifies and annually publishes a list of DSIBs based on their asset size relative to the GDP.  This classification reflects their systemic importance to the Indian financial system, implying that their failure could have significant ripple effects.  The identification process is crucial for implementing enhanced regulatory measures and ensuring the stability of the banking sector.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While SEBI does regulate financial market infrastructures, it does not explicitly designate them as "Domestically Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructures" based solely on asset under management.  The criteria for systemic importance for FMIs are more complex and likely involve considerations beyond just asset size, such as the criticality of their services to the overall market functioning and potential cascading effects of their failure.  While asset size may be a factor in SEBI's overall assessment, it is not the sole or primary determinant for designating systemic importance.  Other regulatory bodies like RBI also play a role in assessing systemic risk within the financial market infrastructure.


**2. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  An investment below the 10% equity threshold can be classified as FDI if the stake is increased to 10% or more within one year.
2.  If an existing FDI falls below 10%, it must be restored to 10% or more to maintain its FDI classification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The regulations allow for an investment initially below the 10% threshold to be considered FDI, provided the investor commits to and subsequently achieves a 10% or higher stake within a year. This provision offers flexibility for investors while maintaining a clear definition of FDI.  The one-year timeframe is crucial for this reclassification, ensuring a timely commitment and preventing manipulative practices.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  Existing FDI investments that fall below the 10% threshold do not lose their FDI classification. This is a key distinction that avoids unnecessary reclassification and complications.  Once an investment is categorized as FDI, it generally retains that status regardless of subsequent fluctuations in ownership percentage as long as the initial investment was made with the intent to meet the FDI criteria.  This ensures consistency and prevents arbitrary changes in classification based on temporary market conditions.



**3. With reference to the regulation of Indian banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has the authority to supersede the boards of directors of all commercial banks, including Public Sector Banks (PSBs).
2.  Commercial banks (excluding PSBs) require RBI’s prior approval for appointing or terminating their Chairpersons, Managing Directors, and CEOs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI possesses significant regulatory powers over commercial banks, its authority is curtailed in the case of PSBs due to the dual regulatory structure involving both the RBI and the central government. The government's influence on PSB governance limits the RBI's ability to supersede their boards directly. The RBI's role in PSB oversight is primarily focused on banking regulations and not management appointments.


Statement 2 is correct.  For commercial banks (excluding PSBs), the RBI maintains a significant role in overseeing top management appointments. The requirement for prior approval ensures that the RBI can assess the suitability of candidates and maintain stability within the banking sector. This regulatory oversight is crucial for protecting depositors' interests and maintaining the financial health of the banking system.  This process allows the RBI to evaluate the candidates' experience and integrity before they assume crucial leadership positions.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) provides insurance coverage to all eligible bank depositors up to ₹5 lakh per depositor per bank, regardless of the number of accounts they hold in that bank.
2.  The DICGC covers deposits of foreign governments, central and state governments, and inter-bank deposits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The DICGC indeed provides insurance coverage up to ₹5 lakh per depositor per bank. This limit applies regardless of whether an individual holds multiple accounts (savings, current, fixed deposit, etc.) within the same bank.  The aggregation of balances across accounts within a single bank is a key feature of the DICGC's protection mechanism.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The DICGC explicitly excludes deposits of foreign governments, central and state governments, and inter-bank deposits from its insurance coverage. These exclusions reflect the different risk profiles and regulatory frameworks associated with these types of deposits, which are generally considered to be less vulnerable to bank failures.  The focus of the DICGC is on protecting small depositors who are most vulnerable to losses in case of bank failure.


**5. With reference to the functions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI acts as a banker to the central and state governments, maintaining accounts for government funds and providing temporary loan facilities.
2.  The RBI manages the public debt, issuing new loans on behalf of the central and state governments, but does not regulate the government securities market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RBI performs a crucial role as a banker to the government, managing government accounts, facilitating transactions, and providing temporary loan facilities such as Ways and Means Advances (WMAs). These functions are essential for smooth government operations and fiscal management.  The RBI's role in this capacity is clearly defined by law and plays a vital role in the country's financial system.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI not only manages the public debt and issues new loans on behalf of the government but also plays a key role in regulating the government securities market.  This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining the stability and efficiency of the market for government securities.  The RBI's powers in this area are derived from the RBI Act, 1934, and are fundamental to its role in monetary policy and financial stability.


**6.  With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following statements:**

1.  All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) are fully regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are regulated by the RBI but were not subject to RBI's power to supersede their boards until a 2019 amendment to the RBI Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The four AIFIs – NABARD, NHB, EXIM Bank, and SIDBI – are indeed under the full regulatory and supervisory purview of the RBI. This reflects their significant role in the financial system and the need for robust oversight to maintain stability and efficiency.  The RBI's oversight ensures adherence to regulations, financial soundness, and responsible lending practices.


Statement 2 is also correct. Until the 2019 amendment to the RBI Act, the RBI's power to supersede the boards of banks did not extend to NBFCs. This amendment was a significant step in enhancing the regulatory framework for NBFCs, giving the RBI the authority to intervene in cases of severe mismanagement or public interest concerns.  The amendment addressed a gap in the regulatory structure and strengthened the RBI's ability to maintain stability in the non-banking financial sector.



**7. With reference to Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FPIs can invest in Central and State Government securities/bonds and corporate bonds, which are treated as debt.
2.  A single FPI can invest a maximum of 20% in an Indian company, while all FPIs combined can invest up to the sectoral cap.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. FPIs are indeed allowed to invest in a range of debt instruments, including government securities and corporate bonds. These investments contribute to capital inflows and provide funding for various sectors of the Indian economy.  The classification of these investments as debt is crucial for understanding their impact on the country's balance of payments and financial markets.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The maximum investment limit for a single FPI in an Indian company is 10%, not 20%. This limit is designed to prevent excessive concentration of ownership by individual investors and maintain market stability. The aggregate investment by all FPIs is subject to sectoral caps, which vary depending on the specific industry or sector. The 10% limit per investor prevents any single entity from having undue influence on the management and operations of the Indian company.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) and American Depository Receipts (ADRs) are mechanisms used by Indian companies to raise finance directly from foreign investors by listing their shares on foreign stock exchanges.
2.  The Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999 requires Indian companies receiving FDI/FPI to obtain prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) at every stage of the investment process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. GDRs and ADRs are indeed mechanisms through which Indian companies can access international capital markets.  These instruments represent ownership in the Indian company but are traded on foreign exchanges, providing a convenient avenue for foreign investors to participate in the Indian market.  They help in accessing a larger pool of international investors and diversifying the investor base.


Statement 2 is incorrect. FEMA 1999 does *not* require Indian companies receiving FDI/FPI to obtain prior approval from the RBI at every stage.  While reporting requirements exist, the need for prior RBI approval has been largely eliminated under the automatic route for FDI.  This streamlining of the process is aimed at promoting ease of doing business and attracting foreign investment.  The reporting requirements help in tracking the inflow of foreign investment into the country.


**9. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PMMY aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing them with collateral-free loans.
2.  The PMMY funds voluntary organizations involved in skill development and employment generation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The PMMY's primary objective is to facilitate access to credit for small businesses and entrepreneurs, particularly those in the informal sector. This is achieved by providing loans without requiring substantial collateral, thereby encouraging formalization and financial inclusion.  The scheme aims to help these businesses grow and contribute to economic activity.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PMMY does not directly fund voluntary organizations involved in skill development. While skill development indirectly contributes to the success of PMMY beneficiaries, the scheme primarily focuses on providing direct financial assistance to entrepreneurs themselves.  There are other government schemes dedicated to supporting skill development organizations.


**10. With reference to the "Government's Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme" and "Gold Monetization Scheme," consider the following statements:**

1.  These schemes aim to reduce India's dependence on gold imports by mobilizing idle gold held by households.
2.  These schemes primarily promote Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewellery sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are designed to bring idle gold from households into the formal financial system. This reduces reliance on gold imports, improves domestic resource utilization, and helps in managing the country's balance of payments.  These schemes encourage the productive use of gold reserves.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  These schemes do not primarily aim to attract FDI in the gold and jewellery sector. While they might indirectly contribute to the sector's growth, their main focus is on mobilizing domestic gold resources and managing the country's gold reserves.  There are other dedicated government policies aimed specifically at promoting FDI in different sectors.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):**

1. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing prices of identical goods and services in different countries, adjusting for differences in purchasing power.
2.  Based on PPP, India consistently ranks among the top ten largest economies globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It aims to determine the real exchange rate by comparing the prices of identical goods and services in different countries, thus accounting for purchasing power differences.  A higher PPP value for a country indicates that its currency has greater purchasing power relative to another currency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's economy is significant, its ranking among the world's largest economies varies depending on whether nominal GDP or PPP-adjusted GDP is used.  While India's PPP-adjusted GDP is substantial, consistently placing it among the top ten largest is not accurate.  The ranking fluctuates based on various factors and the specific year considered.  Reports frequently place it in the top 5 or top 10, but not consistently in one specific position.  Nominal GDP rankings often place it lower.


**2. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  A rise in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) signifies a weakening of the Indian Rupee against a basket of major currencies.
2.  An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates improved competitiveness for Indian exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is an index reflecting the value of a currency against a weighted average of other major currencies. An increase in NEER indicates that the Rupee has appreciated (strengthened) against this basket, making imports cheaper and exports more expensive.  The opposite is true for a decrease in NEER.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) adjusts the NEER for inflation differences between India and its trading partners. An increase in REER suggests that the Rupee has become *overvalued* relative to other currencies, considering inflation. This reduces the competitiveness of Indian exports as they become relatively more expensive in foreign markets. A decrease in REER signifies an improvement in export competitiveness.


**3. With reference to components of internal debt, consider the following statements:**

1.  Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued by the government to finance its budgetary deficits.
2.  Special securities issued to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) represent a form of internal debt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments (typically maturing within a year) issued by the government to borrow money from the market. This is a crucial method for financing short-term government expenditure and bridging budgetary gaps.

Statement 2 is correct.  When the government issues special securities to the RBI, it is essentially borrowing from the central bank. This is considered part of internal debt because the borrowing is within the country's borders.  However, it's important to note that excessive reliance on this method can have implications for monetary policy and inflation.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI):**

1. The CPI gives greater weight to food items compared to the WPI, reflecting household consumption patterns.
2. The WPI solely reflects changes in the prices of goods, while the CPI incorporates changes in service prices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CPI measures changes in the price level of a basket of goods and services consumed by households.  Food items typically constitute a larger share of household budgets in many developing economies, including India, thus receiving a higher weighting in the CPI calculation compared to the WPI, which focuses on wholesale prices of goods.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the WPI primarily focuses on wholesale price changes for goods,  the CPI includes both goods *and* services, providing a broader picture of inflation affecting consumers.  The inclusion of service prices is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of consumer price inflation.



**5. With reference to the impact of high saving economies, consider the following statements:**

1.  High savings rates always translate into proportionally high rates of economic growth.
2. A high capital-output ratio can hinder the ability of high savings to significantly boost output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While high savings are essential for investment and economic growth, the relationship is not always linear or proportional.  Several factors can affect the conversion of savings into productive investments, including the efficiency of the financial system, the quality of investment projects, and macroeconomic stability.

Statement 2 is correct. The capital-output ratio measures the amount of capital required to produce one unit of output. A high capital-output ratio implies that a substantial increase in capital investment is needed to generate a relatively small increase in output.  In such a scenario, even high savings rates may not translate into significant increases in output, hindering economic growth despite high savings.  This could be due to factors like technological inefficiencies or bottlenecks in other sectors.


**6.  With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in domestic inflation relative to global inflation will likely cause a widening gap between NEER and REER.
2.  A depreciation of the Rupee (a fall in NEER) always improves India's trade balance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The difference between NEER and REER reflects the impact of relative inflation. When domestic inflation rises faster than inflation in trading partner countries, the REER tends to appreciate even if the NEER remains unchanged or depreciates only slightly. This happens because the REER accounts for purchasing power changes caused by inflation.  A significant divergence between NEER and REER signals that exchange rate adjustments haven't fully compensated for inflation differentials.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a depreciation of the Rupee makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, potentially improving the trade balance, this is not always guaranteed. The impact on the trade balance depends on various factors, including the price elasticity of demand for imports and exports, the responsiveness of trade volumes to price changes, and global demand conditions.  A depreciated currency might not lead to a trade balance improvement if domestic demand for imports is inelastic (doesn't respond much to price changes).


**7. With reference to measures to mitigate currency crises in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Increased government expenditure is a reliable method to reduce the risk of currency crises.
2.  Remittances from Indians abroad contribute to strengthening the foreign exchange reserves and reducing currency crisis risks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Increased government expenditure, particularly if not financed prudently, can worsen fiscal deficits and put pressure on the currency.  Excessive government spending can lead to increased money supply, potentially causing inflation and making the currency vulnerable to speculative attacks.  Fiscal prudence and responsible government spending are crucial to maintain currency stability.

Statement 2 is correct. Remittances from Indians working abroad represent a significant inflow of foreign exchange into India. This inflow strengthens the country's foreign exchange reserves, providing a buffer against external shocks and reducing vulnerability to currency crises.  A larger reserve cushion gives the central bank more capacity to intervene in the foreign exchange market and maintain currency stability.


**8.  Consider the following statements concerning the factors that influence Indian Government Bond Yields:**

1.  Actions by the United States Federal Reserve (US Fed) have a negligible impact on Indian bond yields.
2. Inflation and short-term interest rates are major determinants of Indian government bond yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Actions by the US Fed, especially changes in US interest rates, significantly influence global capital flows.  When US interest rates rise, investors may shift funds from emerging markets like India to the US seeking higher returns, increasing demand for the dollar and potentially putting downward pressure on the Rupee.  This can indirectly impact Indian bond yields as investors might reduce investments in Indian bonds.

Statement 2 is correct.  Inflation is a key factor determining bond yields because higher inflation erodes the real return on bonds.  Short-term interest rates also influence bond yields as they represent the opportunity cost of holding longer-term bonds.  If short-term rates rise, investors may demand higher yields on longer-term government bonds to compensate for the potential loss of returns from investing in short-term instruments.


**9. With reference to the characteristics of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI primarily involves investments through capital instruments in listed companies only.
2. FDI is largely a non-debt-creating capital flow for the recipient country.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FDI can involve investments in listed companies, it also encompasses investments in unlisted companies. FDI often takes the form of equity investments, joint ventures, or the establishment of wholly-owned subsidiaries, which may be listed or unlisted entities.

Statement 2 is correct. FDI is primarily equity investment, representing ownership stakes in companies.  Unlike debt financing (loans), FDI does not create a debt-servicing obligation for the recipient country.  The investor takes on the risk and potential rewards associated with the company's performance.


**10.  Consider the following statements regarding the impact of devaluation of a currency:**

1. Devaluation improves the price competitiveness of a country's exports in international markets.
2. Devaluation always leads to an immediate improvement in the trade balance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Currency devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers, thus enhancing their price competitiveness in global markets.  This can lead to an increase in export demand.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While devaluation can improve export competitiveness, the impact on the trade balance is not immediate or guaranteed. The effect on the trade balance depends on several factors, including the elasticity of demand for imports and exports (how responsive demand is to price changes), the time it takes for export volumes to respond to price changes, and global demand conditions.  A devaluation might not improve the trade balance if import demand is inelastic or global demand for the country's exports is weak.  There can also be a lag effect before the positive impacts are fully felt.


**1. With reference to the concept of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing prices of identical baskets of goods and services across different countries, adjusting for differences in purchasing power.
2.  PPP exchange rates always accurately reflect the relative value of currencies in international trade due to their consideration of purchasing power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It aims to determine the real exchange rate by comparing the prices of identical goods and services in different countries, adjusting for purchasing power differences.  This allows for a more accurate comparison of living standards and economic output between nations than nominal exchange rates alone.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While PPP exchange rates attempt to account for purchasing power differences, they don't always perfectly reflect the actual exchange rates in international trade. Several factors can cause deviations from PPP, including trade barriers, transportation costs, non-traded goods and services, differences in taxes and regulations, and market imperfections. These factors prevent a complete equalization of prices across borders.  The theory serves as a useful benchmark but isn't a perfect predictor of real-world exchange rates.  Therefore, PPP serves as a theoretical ideal but not a consistently accurate description of actual currency valuations in international markets.


**2. With reference to the determinants of economic development, consider the following statements:**

1.  A rise in absolute and per capita real GNP always signifies enhanced economic development.
2.  High savings rates automatically translate into significant output increases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Increases in absolute and per capita real Gross National Product (GNP) are indicators of economic growth, but not necessarily of economic development.  Economic development encompasses broader factors beyond just economic growth, such as improvements in human capital (education, health), infrastructure, social equity (poverty reduction, income distribution), environmental sustainability, and institutional quality. A country could experience high GNP growth without significant improvements in these areas, thus failing to achieve substantial economic development.  For example, a country might experience rapid growth in a single extractive industry, boosting GNP but leaving the majority of the population impoverished and lacking access to essential services.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While high savings rates are essential for capital formation, they don't guarantee significant output increases.  The efficiency of capital utilization is crucial.  A high capital-output ratio (meaning more capital is needed to generate each unit of output) can negate the positive impact of high savings. This can be due to factors like technological inefficiencies, inadequate infrastructure, poor management, or misallocation of resources.  Therefore, high savings are a necessary but not sufficient condition for substantial output growth.  Other factors like technological progress, human capital development, and efficient resource allocation are equally important.


**3.  With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPI gives a higher weight to food items compared to the WPI.
2. The WPI captures changes in service prices, unlike the CPI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in India reflects the price changes of goods and services consumed by households.  Food items constitute a significant portion of household expenditure, especially for low-income groups.  Consequently, food items are given a higher weight in the CPI basket compared to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). The WPI, on the other hand, tracks price changes at the wholesale level and typically gives lower weight to food items.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) primarily focuses on the price changes of goods traded at the wholesale level.  It doesn't usually include services.  The CPI, however, includes both goods and services consumed by households, providing a broader measure of inflation affecting consumers.  Therefore, the statement that WPI captures service prices is fundamentally inaccurate. The CPI offers a more comprehensive view of inflation impacting the average consumer, encompassing both goods and services.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy and inflation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Demand-pull inflation is exacerbated by expansionary fiscal policies and increased purchasing power.
2. Rising interest rates are a key driver of demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Demand-pull inflation arises when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply. Expansionary fiscal policies (increased government spending or tax cuts) inject more money into the economy, boosting aggregate demand.  Simultaneously, higher purchasing power (due to factors like wage increases or increased consumer confidence) also fuels demand.  When demand significantly surpasses supply, prices are pulled upwards, leading to inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rising interest rates are generally used as a *contractionary* monetary policy tool to combat inflation, not to cause it. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, reducing investment and consumption, thereby dampening aggregate demand. This counteracts demand-pull inflation.  Therefore, rising interest rates work against, not in favor of, demand-pull inflation.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) often employs this tool to manage inflation effectively.


**5. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) actions in response to macroeconomic conditions, consider the following statements:**

1. If inflation is excessively high, the RBI is likely to sell government securities to reduce the money supply.
2. If the Indian rupee is depreciating rapidly, the RBI is likely to buy dollars in the foreign exchange market to support the rupee.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  When inflation is too high, the RBI typically adopts a contractionary monetary policy to curb it. Selling government securities reduces the money supply in the economy. This reduces liquidity, decreases aggregate demand, and helps control inflationary pressures.  This is a standard tool used by central banks worldwide to manage inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. If the Indian rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI would typically intervene in the foreign exchange market by *selling* dollars (from its foreign exchange reserves) and buying rupees. This increases the supply of rupees in the market and reduces the demand for dollars, thus supporting the value of the rupee and preventing further depreciation. Buying dollars in this scenario would exacerbate the depreciation. The RBI's actions aim to stabilize the exchange rate and maintain confidence in the currency.



**6. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. IIBs allow the government to reduce coupon rates on its borrowings.
2.  IIBs protect investors from capital losses due to unexpected inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from inflation.  Since the principal and interest payments are adjusted for inflation, the government can offer lower coupon rates on these bonds compared to conventional bonds. This reduces the government's borrowing costs.  Investors are willing to accept lower nominal returns because the real return is protected from inflation erosion.

Statement 2 is correct. The principal and interest payments on IIBs are adjusted to reflect the rate of inflation. This adjustment protects investors from the erosion of their purchasing power due to unexpected inflation.  While they may not earn exceptionally high returns, they are shielded from the risk of significant capital losses stemming from unexpectedly high inflation.  This feature makes IIBs attractive to risk-averse investors.


**7. With reference to the Indian economy and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), consider the following statements:**

1. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve can lead to capital flight from India.
2.  Devaluation of the domestic currency increases the currency risk associated with ECBs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (like raising interest rates) typically increases interest rates in the US. This makes US assets more attractive to international investors, including those holding investments in India. Consequently, investors may withdraw their funds from India (capital flight) to take advantage of higher returns in the US. This can put downward pressure on the value of the Indian rupee and impact the Indian economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Devaluation of the domestic currency *reduces* the currency risk associated with ECBs (External Commercial Borrowings).  If a company has taken an ECB in a foreign currency (e.g., US dollars), a devaluation of the rupee makes the repayment of the loan cheaper in rupee terms.  The opposite is true; appreciation of the rupee increases the currency risk for the borrower.  Therefore, devaluation acts as a hedge against currency risk for ECB borrowers.


**8. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Convertible bonds offer a lower interest rate compared to non-convertible bonds because of the option to convert into equity.
2. The conversion option provides bondholders with some protection against inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Convertible bonds offer the holder the option of converting the bond into equity shares of the issuing company at a predetermined price or at a future date.  This option provides an additional potential for upside gain and thus reduces the risk of investing in the bond. Due to this lower risk, convertible bonds typically offer a lower interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds. Investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate because of the added benefit of potential equity appreciation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the equity component of a convertible bond *might* offer *some* indirect protection against inflation (if the company's earnings and share price rise with inflation), this is not a guaranteed feature. The protection is not directly linked to inflation like in an inflation-indexed bond. The value of the equity shares depends on numerous factors beyond inflation, including company performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment.  Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that the conversion option provides guaranteed protection against inflation.  The inflation hedge is indirect and not a defining characteristic of the bond.


**9. With reference to the role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Government of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Central Government.
2. The RBI Act grants the Central Government the power to issue directions to the RBI in the public interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is appointed by the President of India, but the appointment is made on the advice of the Central Government.  This reflects the government's ultimate authority over the RBI, although the bank operates with a degree of operational independence.

Statement 2 is correct. Although the RBI enjoys operational autonomy, the RBI Act allows the Central Government to issue directions to the RBI in the public interest.  This provision safeguards the government's ability to intervene in exceptional circumstances to address national priorities.  However, such interventions are typically infrequent and used only in situations of extreme economic urgency or national security.  The balance between government oversight and RBI autonomy is a critical aspect of India's macroeconomic governance.


**10. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. UCBs are primarily supervised and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. UCBs can issue both equity and preference shares to raise capital.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) were initially under the purview of state governments,  the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, as amended, brought them under the regulatory and supervisory control of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI now plays a significant role in overseeing their operations, ensuring their financial health and stability, and maintaining the integrity of the banking system.

Statement 2 is correct. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are permitted to raise capital by issuing both equity and preference shares.  This allows them to diversify their funding sources and strengthen their capital base.  The issuance of these shares is subject to regulatory guidelines and approvals from the RBI.  This is a standard mechanism for UCBs and other financial institutions to raise capital and support their growth and expansion.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) signifies a depreciation of the Rupee.
2.  An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates a decline in trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) actually indicates an *appreciation* of the domestic currency (in this case, the Rupee). NEER is an index that measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies, weighted by their relative importance in trade. A higher NEER means the Rupee is stronger relative to the basket of currencies.  A depreciation would be reflected by a *decrease* in NEER.

Statement 2 is correct.  An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) reflects a *loss* in trade competitiveness. REER adjusts the NEER for inflation differentials between the domestic economy and its trading partners.  If the REER rises, it means the domestic currency has become relatively more expensive compared to other currencies, making exports more costly and imports cheaper, thus reducing trade competitiveness.  A country with a high REER might experience a trade deficit as its goods become less attractive in the international market.


**2. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates are calculated by comparing prices of a similar basket of goods and services across different countries, adjusting for differences in purchasing power.
2.  Based on PPP, India's economy is among the top three largest globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It attempts to determine the real exchange rate based on the relative purchasing power of each currency.  Essentially, it aims to equalize the price of an identical basket of goods and services in different countries when expressed in a common currency. This accounts for differences in the cost of living and price levels across nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's economy is large,  it is not among the top three largest globally when measured using Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).  While PPP calculations do boost India's ranking compared to nominal GDP, it still falls short of the top three largest economies (typically the US, China, and possibly the EU as a bloc) even using the PPP methodology.  The relative ranking varies slightly depending on the year and the specific methodology used.


**3. With reference to Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The weight of food items is significantly higher in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) compared to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).
2.  The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) includes the prices of services, unlike the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which focuses exclusively on goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CPI and WPI are both measures of inflation, but they differ in their scope and methodology.  The CPI tracks the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of goods and services.  Food items constitute a substantial portion of household expenditure for many consumers, hence they receive a significantly higher weight in the CPI.  The WPI, on the other hand, tracks the average change in prices received by producers for a basket of goods at the wholesale level.  While food items are included in the WPI, their weight is typically lower than in the CPI because the WPI encompasses a broader range of goods.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WPI primarily focuses on the prices of goods traded at the wholesale level; it does *not* typically include the prices of services.  The CPI, however, does include the prices of services consumed by households, making it a more comprehensive measure of inflation from the consumer perspective. The exclusion of services from the WPI is a significant limitation of the index as a measure of overall inflation.


**4. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  IIBs offer investors protection against inflation risk by adjusting principal and interest payments based on changes in a specified inflation index.
2.  The interest income and capital gains from IIBs are always exempt from income tax in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to mitigate the impact of inflation on investors.  The principal and interest payments on these bonds are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in a pre-determined inflation index (e.g., CPI). This ensures that the real value of the investment is preserved even during periods of high inflation.  The principal and interest payments increase with inflation, maintaining the purchasing power of the investment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the tax treatment of IIBs can vary depending on the specific features of the bond and the tax laws of the issuing country (in this case, India), it is not universally true that interest income and capital gains are completely tax-exempt. The tax implications need to be evaluated based on the prevailing tax laws at the time of investment and any specific provisions related to the particular IIB.  In India, the tax treatment may vary depending on factors like the investor's tax bracket and other applicable tax regulations.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements regarding demand-pull inflation:**

1.  Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies can contribute to demand-pull inflation.
2.  Rising interest rates generally exacerbate demand-pull inflation by stimulating borrowing and spending.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply. Expansionary monetary policies (e.g., lowering interest rates, increasing money supply) and fiscal policies (e.g., increased government spending, tax cuts) can boost aggregate demand.  When this happens, businesses face increased demand for their goods and services, and they may respond by raising prices, leading to demand-pull inflation. The increased money supply makes it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend, further fueling demand.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rising interest rates typically *curb* demand-pull inflation. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, reducing consumer and business spending. This decrease in aggregate demand helps to alleviate inflationary pressures.  While there can be short-term complexities, the general effect of higher interest rates is to reduce demand and thus counter inflationary trends.


**6. With reference to the functions of money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money serves as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions without the need for a double coincidence of wants.
2.  Money always retains its purchasing power and serves as a perfect store of value, irrespective of inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. One of the primary functions of money is to act as a medium of exchange.  This eliminates the need for a "double coincidence of wants" that is characteristic of barter systems. In a barter system, two individuals must each possess what the other wants to facilitate an exchange. Money acts as an intermediary, allowing individuals to exchange goods and services more efficiently.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While money serves as a store of value, it is not a *perfect* store of value.  During periods of inflation, the purchasing power of money erodes.  This means that the same amount of money will buy fewer goods and services over time.  The real value of money decreases as prices rise, undermining its function as a perfect store of value.  Other assets, like gold or real estate, are sometimes considered better stores of value during periods of high inflation.


**7. With reference to the Indian banking system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The nationalization of 14 major commercial banks in 1969 aimed primarily to expand credit to the priority sectors like agriculture and small-scale industries.
2.  The introduction of the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) was a measure to increase the profitability of commercial banks.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The nationalization of 14 major commercial banks in 1969 was a significant policy decision driven by several factors, including the need to direct credit towards priority sectors that were deemed crucial for economic development.  The government aimed to channel credit more effectively to sectors like agriculture, small-scale industries, and other underserved segments of the economy that were often overlooked by private banks. This was part of a broader socialist-oriented development strategy.  While other objectives existed, the expansion of credit to priority sectors was a central goal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The introduction of the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) was *not* primarily intended to increase the profitability of commercial banks.  Instead, these reserve requirements were regulatory measures implemented by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ensure the liquidity and solvency of banks.  The CRR mandates that banks maintain a certain percentage of their deposits as cash reserves with the RBI, while the SLR requires banks to hold a specified portion of their deposits in the form of liquid assets. These measures enhance the stability of the banking system but do not directly improve bank profitability; in fact, they may reduce profitability by limiting the funds available for lending.


**8. Consider the following statements about the determinants of potential GDP:**

1.  Potential GDP is determined by the available factors of production (labor, capital, and natural resources) and the level of technology.
2.  Government spending directly and solely determines the level of potential GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Potential GDP represents the maximum sustainable level of output an economy can produce when using all its resources efficiently. The key determinants of potential GDP include the quantity and quality of factors of production (labor, capital, natural resources, and technology).  A larger and more skilled workforce, a larger capital stock, abundant natural resources, and advanced technology all contribute to a higher potential GDP.  The productive capacity of the economy is fundamentally linked to these factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While government spending can influence the economy's performance and growth, it does not solely or directly determine potential GDP. Potential GDP is largely determined by the economy's inherent productive capacity,  which is based on the available resources and technology as mentioned above.  Government spending can affect the actual GDP achieved (which may or may not reach the potential GDP), but it doesn't directly change the underlying productive capacity of the economy.  Government policies can certainly influence potential GDP (e.g., through investments in education and infrastructure), but it's not the sole determinant.


**9. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements about the methodology of calculating GDP:**

1.  Before 2015, India's GDP was primarily calculated at factor cost, excluding indirect taxes and subsidies.
2.  From January 2015, the calculation of India's GDP shifted to a methodology that uses market prices, which includes indirect taxes and excludes subsidies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Before January 2015, the National Statistical Office (NSO) in India primarily used the factor cost method to calculate GDP.  This method measures the value of goods and services produced at their basic prices, excluding indirect taxes and subsidies.  This was the standard practice for many years and reflected the value added at each stage of production.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect.  From January 2015, the methodology shifted to calculating GDP at market prices, which includes indirect taxes.  However, it does *not* exclude subsidies; instead, it explicitly accounts for both indirect taxes and subsidies.  The shift to market prices was a significant change aligning India's GDP calculation with international best practices and making it more comparable to other countries' GDP figures.  The inclusion of indirect taxes and subsidies provides a more comprehensive picture of the economy's overall value.


**10. With reference to monetary policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in India is responsible for setting the repo rate to achieve the inflation target set by the government in consultation with the RBI.
2.  The MPC's decisions are not binding on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI); the RBI retains the autonomy to implement its own monetary policy regardless of the MPC's recommendations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in India plays a crucial role in determining the monetary policy stance.  The MPC is responsible for setting the repo rate (the rate at which commercial banks borrow from the RBI), aiming to achieve the inflation target set by the government in consultation with the RBI. The MPC's decision on the repo rate is a key instrument for managing inflation and influencing overall economic activity.  The composition of the MPC includes members from both the RBI and the government, ensuring a balance of perspectives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The decisions of the MPC are indeed *binding* on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  The RBI is legally obligated to implement the repo rate decided by the MPC.  This ensures that the monetary policy framework is transparent and accountable, with the MPC's decisions having direct and immediate impact on the RBI's actions. The RBI, while having expertise in monetary matters, is bound by the MPC's decisions on the repo rate.  Other monetary policy tools might be used at the discretion of the RBI, but the repo rate itself is under the MPC's mandate.


**11. With reference to capital flight, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tight monetary policy in a country can lead to capital flight as investors seek higher returns elsewhere.
2.  A devaluation of the domestic currency generally increases the currency risk associated with External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Capital flight occurs when investors move their capital out of a country, often in response to perceived risks or better investment opportunities elsewhere.  A tight monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates and reduced money supply, can make a country less attractive for investment. Investors may seek higher returns or lower risk in other countries with more favorable monetary conditions.  This outflow of capital can negatively impact the domestic economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A devaluation of the domestic currency actually *reduces* the currency risk associated with External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).  ECBs are loans denominated in foreign currency.  If the domestic currency depreciates, the amount of domestic currency needed to repay the foreign currency loan decreases, reducing the overall cost for the borrower.  Conversely, an appreciation of the domestic currency would increase the currency risk associated with ECBs.  The devaluation effectively lowers the burden of repaying the foreign debt.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI declares banks with assets exceeding 2% of India's GDP as Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs).
2.  The RBI declares Domestic Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) if their asset size surpasses ₹500 crores.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the criteria used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to identify and classify systemically important financial institutions.  Statement 1 correctly states the asset size threshold for designating banks as DSIBs. This classification is crucial for enhanced regulatory oversight and to mitigate potential systemic risks arising from the failure of large banks. The annual declaration of the DSIB list ensures transparency and accountability. Statement 2 similarly outlines the RBI's criteria for identifying systemically important NBFCs, highlighting the growing significance of this sector in the Indian financial landscape and the need for robust regulatory measures to manage systemic risk within the NBFC sector.  Therefore, both statements are correct, making option (c) the appropriate answer. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only partially represent the RBI's classification criteria. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually accurate.


**2. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FDI involves investments in capital instruments of an unlisted Indian company or more than 10% of the equity capital of a listed Indian company.
2.  Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) is defined as any investment in capital instruments where such investment is less than 10 percent of the equity capital of a listed Indian company.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of FDI and FPI in India. Statement 1 correctly defines Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as an investment made by a person resident outside India in the capital instruments of an Indian company, either an unlisted company or a listed company where the investment constitutes 10% or more of the equity capital.  This definition captures the essence of FDI, which involves a significant level of control or influence by the foreign investor. Statement 2 correctly defines Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) as investment by a non-resident in capital instruments of a listed Indian company, where the investment is less than 10% of the equity capital.  This distinction between FDI and FPI is critical for regulatory purposes and understanding different types of capital flows into India.  Therefore, the correct answer is (c), as both statements are accurate and provide a clear delineation of FDI and FPI. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.


**3. With reference to Foreign Investment in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Equity shares represent ownership in a company and confer voting rights.
2.  Debentures, similar to bonds, must invariably be converted into equity shares after a specified period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Equity shares represent ownership in a company, granting shareholders voting rights in proportion to their shareholding. This is a fundamental aspect of corporate finance and equity investment. Shareholders participate in the company's governance and decision-making processes. Statement 2, however, is partially incorrect. While debentures are debt instruments similar to bonds, they do not always have a mandatory conversion clause into equity shares.  Some debentures are redeemable at maturity, while others may have optional conversion features.  The statement's assertion of mandatory conversion is therefore overstated and inaccurate. Thus, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate choice. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the nature of debentures or fail to accurately assess both statements.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) sets rules and makes policy pronouncements on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) through press releases.
2.  Under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999, an Indian company receiving FDI/FPI requires prior RBI approval for issuing shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The DPIIT, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, plays a crucial role in formulating and announcing FDI policy in India. It issues press releases clarifying policy changes and guidelines, making it a key source of information on FDI regulations.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  Under FEMA 1999, an Indian company receiving FDI or FPI is not required to obtain prior approval from the RBI for issuing shares.  The reporting requirements are simplified, requiring only reporting of capital inflow and share issuance to the RBI in specified formats.  Prior RBI approval is not a necessary step under the current regulatory framework.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, leading to option (a) being the most appropriate answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to accurately assess both statements, particularly the role of RBI under FEMA concerning share issuance.


**5. With reference to Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) and American Depository Receipts (ADRs), consider the following statements:**

1.  ADRs allow US investors to purchase shares of companies based outside the US without direct listing on US stock exchanges.
2.  An ADR represents shares of an Indian company held by an Overseas Depository Bank with a Domestic Custodian Bank, with a fixed ratio (e.g., one ADR for every ten shares).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is a correct description of the purpose and function of ADRs. They provide a mechanism for foreign companies to access US capital markets without the complexities and costs of a full listing on US stock exchanges.  This facilitates investment diversification and capital raising opportunities for non-US companies.  Statement 2, however, is partially incorrect. While an ADR does represent shares of a foreign company held by an Overseas Depository Bank, the ratio of ADRs to underlying shares is not always fixed.  The ratio can vary depending on the specific ADR program and the issuing company's decision.  It's not a standardized, universally fixed ratio. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the core function of ADRs, making option (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misinterpret the functionality of ADRs or inaccurately describe the relationship between ADRs and underlying shares.


**6. With reference to  Masala Bonds and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Masala Bonds are a type of ECB denominated in Indian Rupees, where the currency risk is borne by the investor.
2.  ECBs can be raised in foreign currency or Indian Rupee denominations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key features of Masala Bonds and ECBs. Statement 1 correctly identifies Masala Bonds as a type of External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) where the bonds are denominated in Indian Rupees, shifting the currency risk from the Indian borrower to the foreign investor. This makes Masala Bonds attractive to Indian companies seeking to raise capital in foreign markets while mitigating currency risk. Statement 2 correctly states that ECBs can be raised in either foreign currency or Indian Rupee denominations, providing flexibility to borrowers. The choice of currency depends on several factors, including the borrower's risk appetite, hedging strategies, and market conditions. Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the most appropriate answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they only partially capture the features of Masala Bonds and ECBs.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1.  A currency swap is an agreement where two parties exchange principal loan amounts in different currencies, with potential re-exchange at a pre-agreed or prevailing rate.
2.  Currency swaps are primarily used to secure better interest rates on foreign currency loans and to manage exchange rate risks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately depict the core functions and mechanisms of currency swap agreements. Statement 1 correctly describes the fundamental structure of a currency swap, highlighting the exchange of principal amounts in different currencies at the outset and the possibility of re-exchange at a predetermined or market rate at the swap's maturity. This mechanism allows entities to manage their exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. Statement 2 accurately identifies the primary reasons why entities utilize currency swaps. The ability to obtain foreign currency loans at more favorable interest rates and the effective hedging of exchange rate risks are key drivers for engaging in currency swap transactions. Therefore, both statements correctly describe currency swaps, making (c) the appropriate answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.


**8. With reference to the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA), consider the following statements:**

1.  IFSCA is headquartered in GIFT City, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, and was established in April 2020.
2.  Prior to IFSCA's establishment, the RBI, SEBI, PFRDA, and IRDAI individually regulated businesses within IFSCs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of the IFSCA. Statement 1 correctly states the location and establishment date of the IFSCA. The establishment of IFSCA in GIFT City signifies India's commitment to developing a globally competitive international financial services center.  Statement 2 is also correct. Before IFSCA's formation, different financial regulators in India had overlapping jurisdictions over businesses operating within International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs), leading to potential inefficiencies.  IFSCA's creation aimed to streamline regulation and provide a more unified and efficient regulatory environment for IFSCs.  Therefore, both statements are factually correct, making (c) the appropriate answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect, as they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements concerning the IFSCA's establishment and regulatory framework.


**9. With reference to Strategic Disinvestment of Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Strategic disinvestment involves the transfer of a block of shares to a strategic partner, along with the transfer of management control.
2.  Other government organizations or State Governments are permitted to participate in bidding for strategic disinvestment of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines strategic disinvestment. It highlights the key element of transferring a substantial portion of government shareholding (often up to 50% or more) to a strategic partner, along with the crucial aspect of transferring management control. This signifies a significant shift in ownership and operational control. Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  To ensure efficient privatization and avoid perpetuating inefficiencies, other government organizations or state governments are generally not allowed to participate in the bidding process for strategic disinvestment of CPSEs.  The aim is to bring in private sector expertise and management practices.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to correctly assess the participation restrictions in strategic disinvestment.


**10. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The current account of the BoP records transactions that do not alter a country's assets or liabilities outside its borders.
2. The capital account records transactions impacting a country's foreign assets and liabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements provide accurate descriptions of the current and capital accounts within the Balance of Payments (BoP). Statement 1 correctly identifies the current account as encompassing transactions that do not directly change a country's net foreign assets or liabilities. This includes trade in goods and services, investment income, and unilateral transfers. These transactions reflect the country's current economic activity. Statement 2 correctly defines the capital account as recording transactions that do directly affect a country's foreign assets and liabilities.  This includes foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and other capital flows. These transactions represent changes in the country's ownership of foreign assets and liabilities. Therefore, both statements accurately represent the components of the BoP, making (c) the appropriate answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to fully recognize the accurate descriptions of both the current and capital accounts.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) provides emergency liquidity assistance only after a financial institution has exhausted all market and regular RBI liquidity facilities.
2.  The RBI's role as "lender of last resort" aims solely to prevent individual bank failures, without considering broader macroeconomic implications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The RBI's emergency liquidity assistance is a safety net, deployed only as a last resort when other options are exhausted. This prevents a cascading effect on the financial system. The text explicitly states that this assistance is provided to protect depositors and prevent bank failures that could negatively impact other institutions and macroeconomic stability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While preventing individual bank failures is a crucial aspect of the "lender of last resort" function, it's not the sole objective. The RBI's intervention also aims to maintain broader macroeconomic and financial stability. A single bank failure can trigger a crisis, impacting the entire financial system and the economy.  The RBI's actions are designed to prevent such systemic risks.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) functions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's currency management function involves solely the design and production of currency notes, leaving distribution entirely to commercial banks.
2.  The RBI's oversight of payment and settlement systems extends to authorizing both banks and non-bank entities to operate payment systems in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI is responsible for the design, production, and overall management of the nation's currency, it doesn't solely focus on design and production. The text clarifies that the RBI manages currency through its department of currency management, issue offices, and currency chests, and also authorizes selected bank branches to establish currency chests for distribution. The distribution is not solely left to commercial banks.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RBI plays a vital developmental role in the national payment systems, authorizing both banks and non-bank entities to operate these systems under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  The text details the various types of payment system operators authorized by the RBI, including both banks and non-bank entities.


**3. With reference to the RBI's developmental role, consider the following statements:**

1.  Priority Sector Lending (PSL) guidelines mandate preferential interest rates for loans to priority sectors.
2.  The co-lending model allows banks to classify all loans sanctioned by Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) as PSL.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that priority sector guidelines *do not* lay down any preferential rate of interest for priority sector loans.  The focus is on ensuring adequate credit to these sectors, not on offering subsidized interest rates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The revised on-lending model allows banks to classify only *fresh* loans sanctioned by NBFCs (out of bank borrowing) as PSL.  It doesn't include all loans sanctioned by NBFCs.  There's also a limit of five percent of a bank's total PSL on an ongoing basis for credit to NBFCs for on-lending.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's Economic Capital Framework (ECF) primarily aims at transferring the entire net income to the government.
2.  The Bimal Jalan Committee recommended that the RBI maintain a contingency risk buffer of 5.5% to 6.5% of its balance sheet.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transferring a portion of the net income to the government is an objective of the ECF (as RBI is a 100% subsidiary of the Government of India), it's not the primary aim. The primary objectives are to maintain adequate funds for crisis management and to ensure the RBI's solvency.  The text clearly indicates that the ECF aims to allocate funds to capital reserves to meet risk contingencies *and* transfer profits to the government.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bimal Jalan Committee's recommendations, as detailed in the text, specifically suggested that the RBI maintain a 5.5% to 6.5% contingency risk buffer based on the value of its balance sheet.


**5. With reference to cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Cryptocurrencies are legal tender and are issued by governments or central banks.
2.  The primary motivation behind the RBI's launch of e-Rupee is to completely replace physical cash.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cryptocurrencies are explicitly described in the text as *not* being legal tender and are *not* issued by governments or central banks. They are decentralized digital or virtual currencies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the e-Rupee is intended to *complement* physical cash, not replace it entirely. The RBI's launch is driven by concerns about the potential destabilization of the financial system by private cryptocurrencies and the need to meet public demand for digital currencies.


**6. With reference to e-RUPI and CBDC, consider the following statements:**

1.  e-RUPI is a digital currency that can be freely transferred and converted into cash.
2.  CBDCs offer advantages like being backed by the central bank, which cannot go bankrupt, unlike commercial banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that e-RUPI is a digital *voucher*, not a digital currency. It cannot be transferred to other persons and cannot be converted into cash; it is purpose-specific and redeemable only at designated centers.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key advantage of CBDCs highlighted in the text is that they are backed by the central bank, unlike deposits in commercial banks, which are subject to the solvency of the bank.  The central bank, in theory, cannot go bankrupt, providing a higher level of security for holders of CBDCs.


**7. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The fundamental difference between a bank and a Non-Banking Financial Institution (NBFI) lies in the acceptance of demand deposits.
2.  Scheduled commercial banks are those included in the second schedule of the RBI Act, 1934, and must have a minimum paid-up share capital of ₹500 crore.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The defining characteristic that distinguishes banks from NBFIs is the acceptance of demand deposits. Banks accept demand deposits (payable on demand), while NBFIs do not.

Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly defines scheduled banks as those listed in the second schedule of the RBI Act, 1934, and specifies the minimum paid-up share capital requirement.


**8. With reference to Cooperative Banks in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are solely regulated by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) of the respective state.
2.  Rural Cooperative Banks operate through a three-tier system: State Cooperative Banks (StCBs), District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs), and Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UCBs are under *dual* regulation: the RCS of the respective state and the RBI.  The RBI regulates banking functions, while the RCS handles non-banking aspects. The text explicitly mentions this "duality of control".

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the three-tier structure of the rural cooperative credit system in India, involving StCBs, DCCBs, and PACS.


**9. With reference to the RBI's regulatory powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI has the same regulatory powers over Public Sector Banks (PSBs) as it does over private sector banks.
2.  The RBI regulates the interest rates on all categories of deposits and lending undertaken by banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that PSBs are under dual regulation (Central Government and RBI), and the RBI's powers are curtailed regarding PSBs.  The RBI cannot remove directors, supersede the board, or force mergers or liquidation of PSBs to the same extent as with private banks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions that interest rates on most deposit and lending categories are deregulated, determined by banks themselves.  The RBI regulates interest rates only on specific categories, such as NRI deposits and export credits.


**10. With reference to the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), consider the following statements:**

1.  DICGC provides insurance cover to all types of bank deposits, including those of foreign governments and central/state governments.
2.  If a bank is under moratorium, DICGC will pay depositors up to ₹5 lakh within 90 days, as per the amended DICGC Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. DICGC does *not* cover deposits of foreign governments, central/state governments, and inter-bank deposits.  The text explicitly lists these exceptions.

Statement 2 is correct. The text highlights the amendment to the DICGC Act in 2021, ensuring that even during bank moratoriums, depositors receive up to ₹5 lakh within 90 days.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the RBI's role in managing the money supply:**

1.  The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) are primarily intended to maximize bank profits.
2.  Open Market Operations (OMOs) involve the RBI buying or selling government securities to influence the money supply.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CRR and SLR are designed to ensure bank solvency and liquidity, not to maximize profits.  They are prudential measures to protect depositors and maintain financial stability.  High profits at the cost of safety and liquidity are not the objective.

Statement 2 is correct. OMOs, as clearly explained in the text, are a key tool used by the RBI to manage liquidity and influence the money supply in the economy.  The RBI buys or sells government securities to inject or absorb liquidity.


**12. With reference to the Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS), consider the following statements:**

1.  MSS was introduced primarily to address the challenges posed by volatile capital inflows.
2.  MSS involves the RBI issuing government securities and using the proceeds to fund fiscal deficits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text clearly states that MSS was introduced in 2004 to absorb surplus liquidity arising from large capital inflows, thereby mitigating the risks of currency appreciation and inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions that MSS proceeds are *not* used to fund fiscal deficits.  The funds from MSS bond sales are used for redemption of the securities issued under the scheme, and the interest payments are covered by government budgetary allocations.


**13.  With reference to the Narasimham Committee recommendations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Narasimham Committee I recommended reducing the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) to 25% and phasing out the directed credit programme.
2.  Narasimham Committee II recommended that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should not own any banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Narasimham Committee I (on Financial System) indeed recommended reducing the SLR and phasing out or redefining the directed credit program to improve efficiency and profitability of the banking sector.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Narasimham Committee II (on Banking Sector Reforms) recommended that the RBI, as a regulator, should not own banks to avoid conflicts of interest.  Subsequently, the RBI divested its shareholdings in various public sector banks.


**14. With reference to the P J Nayak Committee recommendations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The committee proposed establishing a Bank Investment Company (BIC) to hold government ownership in Public Sector Banks (PSBs).
2. The committee recommended that the Government of India should retain majority ownership and voting power in PSBs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The P J Nayak Committee recommended creating a BIC to hold government ownership in PSBs, thereby enhancing their autonomy and improving governance.  This would allow for better management and reduce government interference.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Nayak Committee's core recommendation was to reduce government control over PSBs, advocating for a reduction in government stake and increased autonomy for the banks.  The committee explicitly aimed to lessen government interference and improve the governance of these institutions.


**15. With reference to the Financial Services Institutions Bureau (FSIB), consider the following statements:**

1. FSIB replaced the Banks Board Bureau (BBB) and advises the government on the appointment of directors in PSBs only.
2. FSIB's functions include advising on performance appraisal systems and developing training programs for management personnel in PSBs, FIs, and PSIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While FSIB did replace BBB, its advisory role extends beyond PSBs. It advises on appointments in Public Sector Banks (PSBs), financial institutions (FIs), and Public Sector Insurers (PSIs).

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly lists advising on performance appraisal systems and developing training programs for management personnel in PSBs, FIs, and PSIs as key functions of the FSIB.  The FSIB plays a crucial role in enhancing the governance and professionalism of these institutions.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme primarily aims to provide subsidized loans to farmers for specific crops.
2.  It seeks to integrate small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) is a scheme designed to provide funding to micro/small units and entrepreneurs, thereby promoting entrepreneurship and job creation.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this core objective.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while MUDRA may indirectly benefit farmers who are also entrepreneurs, its primary focus is not on agricultural loans.  The scheme aims to bring these small businesses into the formal financial system, providing access to credit and financial services that were previously unavailable or difficult to access.  This formalization improves their business prospects and contributes to the overall economic growth.  Other government schemes specifically target agricultural loans.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Government's Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme:**

1.  These schemes aim to reduce India's dependence on gold imports by mobilizing domestic gold reserves.
2.  A major objective is to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Both the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are initiatives by the Indian government to utilize the vast amount of gold held by households. Statement 1 correctly identifies a key objective: reducing reliance on gold imports. By encouraging citizens to invest in bonds or monetize their gold, the government aims to increase domestic gold reserves and thus lower the need for imports.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While these schemes might indirectly impact FDI, their primary focus is not on attracting FDI into the gold and jewelry sector. The primary aim is to bring idle gold into the formal economy, boosting domestic resources and reducing import dependency. FDI attraction is a secondary or indirect consequence.


**3. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  NPCI's primary role is to regulate interest rates on various financial products.
2.  NPCI has launched RuPay, a domestic card payment network.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is an umbrella organization that operates various retail payment systems in India.  Statement 2 is accurate; NPCI is indeed responsible for the launch and operation of RuPay, a significant domestic competitor to international card networks.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  NPCI does not regulate interest rates; that function primarily resides with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  NPCI focuses on the infrastructure and operational aspects of payment systems, aiming to improve efficiency and accessibility.  The role of interest rate regulation is a distinct function of monetary policy.


**4.  With reference to "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1.  MDR is an incentive offered by the government to merchants for promoting digital payments.
2.  MDR represents a charge levied on merchants by banks for accepting debit card payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a fee charged to merchants by banks for processing debit and credit card transactions. Statement 2 correctly defines this. While the government might incentivize digital payments through other schemes, MDR itself is not a government incentive but a cost incurred by the merchant. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  MDR is a crucial element of the cost structure for businesses accepting digital payments and influences their decision to adopt digital payment methods.  Understanding MDR is essential for analyzing the effectiveness of government initiatives promoting digital transactions.


**5. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Legal tender money refers exclusively to metallic currency in circulation.
2.  A creditor is legally obligated to accept legal tender money in settlement of debts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Legal tender is the form of money that a creditor must accept as payment for a debt. Statement 2 accurately reflects this legal definition.  Statement 1 is incorrect; legal tender encompasses more than just metallic currency.  It includes banknotes and coins issued by the central bank and designated as legal tender by law.  The scope of legal tender may evolve with changes in the monetary system. Understanding the concept of legal tender is critical for analyzing financial transactions and legal enforceability.


**6. Consider the following statements about Treasury Bills:**

1.  Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued only by the State Governments.
2.  Treasury bills are always issued at a discount to their face value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Treasury bills (T-bills) are short-term debt instruments issued by governments (both central and, in some cases, state) to finance their short-term borrowing needs. Statement 1 is incorrect;  while some state governments might issue T-bills, the primary issuer is the central government. Statement 2 is correct; T-bills are typically sold at a discount to their face value (the amount the investor receives at maturity). This discount represents the interest earned by the investor.  The understanding of T-bills is essential in analyzing government finance and monetary policy.


**7. With reference to the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), consider the following statements:**

1.  CAR is determined by each individual bank based on its risk assessment.
2.  CAR represents the amount banks must maintain as their own funds to cover potential losses from loan defaults.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a regulatory requirement for banks to maintain a minimum level of capital relative to their risk-weighted assets. Statement 2 accurately describes the core purpose of CAR: to ensure banks have enough capital to absorb potential losses. Statement 1 is incorrect; while banks may conduct internal risk assessments, the minimum CAR requirement is set by regulatory authorities (like the RBI in India), not by individual banks.  The regulatory framework ensures a consistent level of safety and stability within the banking system.


**8. With reference to factors that reduce the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Increased government expenditure significantly contributes to currency stability.
2.  Remittances from Indians working abroad help mitigate currency risk.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A currency crisis occurs when a country's currency experiences a sharp and rapid devaluation.  Statement 2 is correct; remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) provide a significant inflow of foreign exchange, bolstering the country's foreign exchange reserves and thus helping to stabilize the currency.  Statement 1 is incorrect; increased government expenditure, especially if not financed prudently, can actually increase the risk of a currency crisis by potentially widening the fiscal deficit and increasing demand for foreign currency.  The management of government finances is crucial for currency stability.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding measures a government/RBI might take to prevent a slide in the Indian Rupee:**

1.  Implementing an expansionary monetary policy is a common and effective measure.
2.  Curbing imports of non-essential goods and promoting exports is a typical response.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A depreciating rupee can be a serious economic concern. Statement 2 accurately describes a standard policy response:  reducing import demand and increasing export competitiveness through various measures. This helps improve the balance of payments and reduce pressure on the Rupee. Statement 1 is incorrect; an expansionary monetary policy, while sometimes used to stimulate the economy, can actually worsen a depreciating currency if it leads to increased inflation or higher demand for imports.  Contractionary monetary policies are more likely to be used during currency crises.


**10. With reference to the effect of an increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) on the money multiplier, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in CRR leads to a decrease in the money multiplier.
2.  An increase in CRR leads to an increase in the money supply.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The money multiplier shows the potential of the banking system to create money.  Statement 1 is correct; an increase in the CRR (the percentage of deposits banks must keep with the central bank) reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thus decreasing the money multiplier.  Statement 2 is incorrect; increasing the CRR directly reduces the money supply as banks have less available to lend.  Understanding the relationship between CRR and the money multiplier is crucial for analyzing monetary policy effectiveness.


**11.  If another global financial crisis occurs, which of the following actions would most likely protect India?**

1.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility.
2.  Reducing reliance on short-term foreign borrowings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Global financial crises can have severe repercussions for economies worldwide. Statement 2 is correct; reducing dependence on short-term foreign debt makes an economy less vulnerable to sudden capital flight during a crisis.  Short-term debt needs to be rolled over frequently, making it risky during periods of global uncertainty.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while capital account convertibility offers benefits in normal times, during a crisis, it can make a country more susceptible to speculative attacks and capital flight.  Restricting short-term liabilities is a key strategy for mitigating risk.


**12. Consider the following statements about the immediate effect on aggregate money supply if Rs. 1,00,000 is withdrawn in cash from a demand deposit account:**

1.  The money supply will decrease by Rs. 1,00,000.
2.  The money supply will remain unchanged.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The aggregate money supply is the total amount of money circulating in an economy. Statement 2 is correct, while seemingly counterintuitive; the money supply remains largely unchanged.  When cash is withdrawn, it simply changes form from a demand deposit to physical currency, but the total amount of money in the system remains the same.  Statement 1 is incorrect because it overlooks the fact that the withdrawn money still exists within the economy, just in a different form.


**13. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, consider the following purposes for which short-term credit support is provided:**

1.  Construction of a family house.
2.  Post-harvest expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme is designed to provide credit to farmers for various agricultural activities. Statement 2 is correct; post-harvest expenses, such as transportation, storage, and processing, are indeed covered under the scheme. Statement 1 is incorrect; the KCC scheme's focus is on agricultural needs, and financing for non-agricultural purposes like house construction is typically not included.  The scope of KCC is limited to supporting agricultural production and related activities.


**14. With reference to Commercial Paper, Certificates of Deposit, and Call Money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Call money is a short-term instrument used primarily for interbank transactions.
2.  Certificates of Deposit are long-term instruments issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Commercial Paper (CP), Certificates of Deposit (CDs), and Call Money are all short-term money market instruments. Statement 1 is correct; call money is indeed a short-term instrument used extensively for interbank transactions and for short-term liquidity management.  Statement 2 is incorrect; CDs are short-term instruments issued by commercial banks, not the RBI. They are typically issued for periods ranging from a few days to a year. The maturity of CDs is less than one year.


**15. Consider the following statements about the characteristics of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India:**

1.  It primarily involves investments through capital instruments in listed companies.
2.  FDI is largely a non-debt-creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) represents long-term investments made by foreign entities in domestic companies. Statement 2 is correct; FDI is primarily equity investment and does not involve debt servicing obligations in the same way as loans. Statement 1 is incorrect;  while FDI can occur in listed companies, it also frequently involves investments in unlisted companies or joint ventures. FDI can take various forms, including equity investments, mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures.


**16. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI Governor is appointed by the Parliament of India.
2.  The RBI Act grants the RBI Governor significant authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the central bank of India. Statement 2 is correct; the RBI Act empowers the Governor with extensive authority over monetary policy, banking regulation, and overall financial stability. Statement 1 is incorrect; the RBI Governor is appointed by the Central Government, not the Parliament. The appointment process involves consultations and considerations.


**17.  With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  UCBs are supervised and regulated by local boards established by State Governments.
2.  UCBs are permitted to issue both equity and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are a significant part of India's financial landscape. Statement 2 is correct; UCBs, like other companies, are allowed to raise capital by issuing equity and preference shares. Statement 1 is incorrect; while State Governments play a role in their oversight, the primary regulatory body for UCBs is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which has brought most UCBs under the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.


**18. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following:**

1.  Actions of the United States Federal Reserve have a significant impact.
2.  Domestic inflation and short-term interest rates are major determinants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Government bond yields reflect the return investors expect on government debt. Statement 1 is correct; global factors, such as actions by the US Federal Reserve, influence global interest rates and capital flows, significantly affecting Indian bond yields. Statement 2 is also correct; domestic economic conditions, including inflation and short-term interest rates, are crucial determinants of bond yields.  These factors affect investor demand for government bonds.


**19. Consider the following that can be included in Foreign Direct Investments:**

1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds.
2.  Global depository receipts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) represents substantial, long-term investments by foreign entities in domestic markets. Statement 2 is correct; Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) and American Depository Receipts (ADRs), which represent shares of a foreign company, are a common form of FDI. Statement 1 is incorrect; Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs) are debt instruments, not direct equity investments, and hence are not classified as FDI but as a form of External Commercial Borrowing (ECB).


**20. With reference to the effects of currency devaluation, consider the following:**

1.  Devaluation necessarily improves the trade balance.
2.  Devaluation enhances the competitiveness of domestic exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Currency devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper and imports more expensive. Statement 2 is correct; devaluation makes domestic goods more competitive in international markets, potentially leading to increased exports. Statement 1 is incorrect; while devaluation can improve the trade balance, it's not guaranteed.  The effect depends on various factors, including the price elasticity of demand for imports and exports, and the responsiveness of producers to the price changes.


**21.  With reference to factors that can cause or increase demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following:**

1.  Expansionary policies.
2.  Rising interest rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand outpaces aggregate supply. Statement 1 is correct; expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, by increasing the money supply or government spending, can fuel demand-pull inflation.  Statement 2 is incorrect; rising interest rates are typically used to *curb* inflation, not cause it, by reducing borrowing and spending.  Rising interest rates reduce aggregate demand.


**22. Consider the following statements concerning the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) actions in response to economic conditions:**

1.  If inflation is too high, the RBI is likely to sell government securities.
2.  If the Rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to buy dollars in the market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The RBI uses various monetary policy tools to manage inflation and exchange rates. Statement 1 is correct; to curb inflation, the RBI would likely sell government securities, reducing the money supply and thus dampening demand. Statement 2 is incorrect; to counter a rapidly depreciating Rupee, the RBI would typically *sell* dollars from its reserves to increase the supply of dollars in the market, supporting the Rupee's value.


**23. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs), consider the following advantages:**

1.  IIBs provide investors with protection against inflation uncertainty.
2.  The interest received and capital gains on IIBs are always tax-exempt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation. Statement 1 is correct; IIBs adjust their principal value based on inflation, providing a hedge against inflation risk. Statement 2 is incorrect; while some aspects of returns on IIBs might have tax advantages, the tax treatment can vary depending on the specific bond and applicable tax laws.  Tax implications are not universally tax-exempt.


**24. Consider the following statements regarding the potential effects of a tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve:**

1.  It could lead to capital flight from emerging markets like India.
2.  It would necessarily decrease the interest cost for firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve typically involves raising interest rates. Statement 1 is correct; higher US interest rates can attract capital away from emerging markets like India, leading to capital flight as investors seek higher returns in the US. Statement 2 is incorrect; a tight US monetary policy would likely *increase* the interest cost for firms with existing ECBs denominated in foreign currencies, as the cost of servicing those debts would rise due to higher interest rates in the US.


**25. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1.  Convertible bonds typically offer a higher interest rate compared to non-convertible bonds.
2.  The conversion option provides bondholders with some protection against inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Convertible bonds give the holder the option to convert the bond into equity shares of the issuing company. Statement 1 is incorrect; convertible bonds usually offer a lower interest rate than non-convertible bonds because of the added benefit of the conversion option.  Statement 2 is correct; the conversion option offers some protection against inflation as the value of the equity shares may increase with inflation, offsetting the loss in purchasing power of the bond.  The conversion feature provides a degree of flexibility and potential upside.



**1. With reference to the impact of surging capital inflows on a developing economy, consider the following statements:**

1. Surging capital inflows invariably lead to currency appreciation, thereby boosting the competitiveness of export industries.
2.  Central banks often employ sterilization techniques, primarily through open market operations, to mitigate inflationary pressures arising from such inflows.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While surging capital inflows can lead to currency appreciation, this effect undermines, rather than boosts, the competitiveness of export industries. A stronger currency makes exports more expensive for foreign buyers, reducing demand and potentially harming the export sector.  This is a crucial point in understanding macroeconomic stability in an open economy.  Governments need to balance the benefits of capital inflows with the potential negative impacts on their export sectors.

Statement 2 is correct. Sterilization is a common monetary policy tool used by central banks to manage the effects of large capital inflows.  The influx of foreign currency increases the money supply, potentially leading to inflation. To counteract this, central banks sell government securities in the open market. This reduces the money supply and helps to stabilize prices.  The effectiveness of sterilization depends on various factors, including the size and persistence of the capital inflow, the central bank's ability to control money supply, and the overall state of the economy.  It's a complex issue with no guaranteed success, but it's a key tool in a central bank's arsenal.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) functions, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's primary objective is solely focused on maintaining price stability, irrespective of economic growth considerations.
2. The RBI Act of 1934 and the Banking Regulation Act of 1949 empower the RBI to regulate and supervise both banking and non-banking financial institutions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While price stability is a crucial objective for the RBI, it is not the sole focus. The RBI's mandate also includes promoting economic growth and maintaining macroeconomic stability.  A balanced approach is necessary, recognizing that overly aggressive pursuit of price stability can stifle economic growth, and vice-versa. The RBI aims for a delicate balance between these competing goals, adapting its monetary policy to changing economic conditions.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI Act, 1934, and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, provide the legal basis for the RBI's regulatory and supervisory powers over the financial sector. This includes commercial banks, cooperative banks, regional rural banks, and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).  This comprehensive oversight is vital for maintaining financial stability and protecting the interests of depositors. The RBI's regulatory framework covers various aspects of financial operations, including licensing, mergers, and the overall soundness of institutions.


**3. With reference to India's balance of payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. A current account deficit is always a negative indicator, reflecting a country’s economic weakness and unsustainable spending habits.
2. The overall balance of payments (surplus or deficit) is determined by the net effect of autonomous transactions, with official reserve transactions acting as the accommodating item.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a persistent and large current account deficit can be a cause for concern, it doesn't automatically signal economic weakness.  A current account deficit can reflect healthy economic activity, such as strong domestic demand leading to increased imports, or significant foreign investment inflows financing the deficit. The sustainability of a current account deficit depends on factors like the country's overall economic fundamentals, the nature of capital flows, and global economic conditions.  It's a complex issue needing careful analysis rather than simplistic interpretation.

Statement 2 is correct.  Autonomous transactions are those driven by market forces and individual decisions, such as imports and exports based on price and demand.  Accommodating transactions, on the other hand, are undertaken to balance the BoP.  Official reserve transactions, where the central bank buys or sells foreign currency reserves, are the primary accommodating item. If autonomous transactions result in a deficit, the central bank uses its reserves to cover the shortfall. If there is a surplus, the reserves increase. This distinction is crucial for understanding how a country manages its external accounts.


**4. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. IIBs allow the government to borrow at lower coupon rates due to the protection offered to investors against inflation risk.
2. The interest income and capital gains from IIBs are always tax-exempt.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) offer investors protection against inflation.  The principal and interest payments on IIBs are adjusted according to changes in a pre-defined inflation index. This reduced inflation risk allows the government to issue these bonds at lower coupon rates compared to conventional bonds, reducing its borrowing costs. This is an important aspect of fiscal management, allowing the government to manage its debt more efficiently.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The tax treatment of IIBs varies depending on the specific terms of the bond issue and the country's tax laws.  While some IIBs might offer tax advantages, it's not universally true that both interest income and capital gains are always tax-exempt.  Tax implications are an important consideration for investors when deciding whether to purchase IIBs.  One should always consult the relevant tax regulations to understand the tax treatment applicable to the specific IIB.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy's experience with exchange rate management, consider the following statements:**

1.  Prior to 1991, India maintained a rigidly fixed exchange rate system, with no adjustments allowed based on economic conditions.
2. The Liberalised Exchange Rate Management System (LERMS) introduced in 1992 involved a dual exchange rate system, eventually converging to a single market-determined rate.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Before 1991, India did not maintain a rigidly fixed exchange rate system.  While the rupee was pegged to the pound sterling initially, and later to a basket of currencies, the system allowed for adjustments based on economic conditions.  Devaluations were undertaken to address balance of payments issues. The system was more accurately described as an "adjustable peg" rather than a rigidly fixed system.  Understanding the nuances of exchange rate regimes is important for grasping the history of monetary and trade policies.

Statement 2 is correct.  LERMS, introduced in 1992, did involve a dual exchange rate system, with a portion of foreign exchange earnings surrendered at an official rate and the remainder at market-determined rates. This dual system was later unified into a single market-determined exchange rate in 1993, representing a significant step towards current account convertibility.  This transition reflects India's shift towards a more market-oriented exchange rate policy.


**6. With reference to the determinants of market demand for a good, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the price of a substitute good will lead to a decrease in the demand for the good in question.
2. An increase in the price of a complementary good will lead to an increase in the demand for the good in question.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of another.  If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper good in question, leading to an *increase* in its demand, not a decrease. This is a fundamental concept in microeconomics, highlighting the relationship between prices and consumer choices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Complementary goods are those that are consumed together.  If the price of a complementary good increases, the demand for the good in question will *decrease* because consumers will reduce their consumption of both goods due to the higher overall cost.  This demonstrates the interconnectedness of demand for related goods.  Understanding the relationship between substitute and complementary goods is crucial for analyzing market dynamics.


**7. With reference to India's economic reforms since 1991, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms led to an immediate and substantial reduction in poverty, with the poverty rate drastically decreasing within a few years.
2.  While the reforms spurred economic growth, they also led to an increase in income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the 1991 reforms did contribute to long-term poverty reduction in India, the effect wasn't immediate or drastic in the initial years.  Poverty reduction is a complex process influenced by various factors, including economic growth, government policies, and social programs.  It takes time for the benefits of economic reforms to trickle down to the poorest segments of the population.  A nuanced understanding of poverty dynamics is crucial for evaluating the impact of economic policies.

Statement 2 is correct.  Evidence suggests that India's economic reforms since 1991, while boosting overall growth, have also led to an increase in income inequality.  The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, has shown an upward trend in the post-reform period. This highlights the challenge of ensuring inclusive growth, where the benefits of economic progress are shared more equitably across society.  Addressing income inequality is a major policy challenge for India.


**8. With reference to the characteristics of human capital, consider the following statements:**

1.  Human capital, unlike physical capital, is perfectly mobile across international borders, allowing for easy transfer of skills and expertise.
2. Investment in health is a significant source of human capital formation, contributing to increased labor productivity and overall economic output.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Human capital is not perfectly mobile across international borders.  While skilled individuals can migrate, there are significant barriers, including immigration policies, language barriers, cultural differences, and family ties.  The movement of human capital is considerably more complex than the movement of physical capital, which can be more easily transported and transferred.

Statement 2 is correct.  Investment in health is a crucial component of human capital formation.  A healthy population is more productive, leading to increased labor output and economic growth.  This includes investments in preventive healthcare, curative medicine, and public health infrastructure.  Recognizing the importance of health as a form of capital investment is essential for economic development strategies.  Healthy individuals contribute more effectively to the economy.


**9. With reference to the impact of economic reforms on India's agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The removal of fertilizer subsidies has consistently led to lower production costs for farmers, enhancing their competitiveness.
2. The opening up of the agricultural sector to international trade has always benefited Indian farmers, providing them with greater market access and higher incomes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The removal of fertilizer subsidies has generally increased the cost of production for farmers, particularly small and marginal farmers who are less able to absorb these increased costs.  This has negatively impacted their profitability and competitiveness, especially when faced with fluctuations in agricultural prices.  Subsidy removal is a complex issue with both potential benefits (efficient resource allocation) and drawbacks (increased costs for vulnerable farmers).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While opening up to international trade offers potential benefits, the impact on Indian farmers has been mixed.  Increased competition from cheaper imports has hurt many farmers, particularly those producing crops where India lacks a significant comparative advantage.  Moreover, the lack of adequate market access and infrastructure in some regions has limited the benefits of global trade for many Indian farmers.  The impact of trade liberalization is context-specific and depends heavily on factors like market access, infrastructure, and the type of agricultural products.


**1. With reference to the Indian economy's demand-pull inflation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Expansionary fiscal policies and increased government spending directly contribute to increased aggregate demand, thereby fueling demand-pull inflation.
2.  Inflation-indexing wages, while potentially impacting inflation, does not directly cause demand-pull inflation as it is a consequence of existing inflationary pressures rather than a primary driver.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation arises when aggregate demand outpaces aggregate supply. Expansionary fiscal policies, characterized by increased government spending or tax cuts, directly inject more money into the economy, boosting aggregate demand.  This increased demand, if not met by a corresponding increase in supply, leads to upward pressure on prices, resulting in demand-pull inflation.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this causal relationship.

Statement 2, however, presents a more nuanced scenario. Inflation-indexing wages adjusts wages based on the rate of inflation.  While this can contribute to a wage-price spiral (where rising wages lead to higher prices, which further fuels wage increases), it's not the *cause* of demand-pull inflation.  Instead, it's a *reaction* to already existing inflationary pressures.  The initial impetus for demand-pull inflation comes from the excessive demand, not from the adjustment of wages in response to that demand. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect in its presentation as a direct cause.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the direct causal link between expansionary fiscal policies and demand-pull inflation.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s actions in response to economic conditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  If the Indian rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to intervene by selling dollars from its foreign exchange reserves to increase the demand for the rupee and curb its depreciation.
2.  If interest rates in the USA or European Union fall, this might induce the RBI to buy dollars, strengthening the dollar and potentially weakening the rupee to maintain a competitive exchange rate.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A rapid depreciation of the rupee poses a threat to macroeconomic stability.  To counter this, the RBI often intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling dollars from its reserves. This increases the supply of rupees and reduces the supply of dollars, thereby increasing the demand for rupees and supporting its value. This is a standard practice employed by central banks worldwide to manage exchange rate fluctuations. Statement 1 correctly describes this intervention strategy.

When interest rates in major economies like the US or EU fall, it can lead to capital outflows from India as investors seek higher returns elsewhere. This outflow of capital increases the supply of rupees and reduces demand, potentially leading to further rupee depreciation. To mitigate this, the RBI might buy dollars, thus reducing the supply of rupees and supporting its value.  This action helps maintain a more stable and competitive exchange rate for the Indian rupee. Statement 2 accurately describes a potential RBI response to such a scenario.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the RBI's typical interventions in both scenarios.


**3. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  IIBs offer investors protection against inflation risk by adjusting the principal and/or interest payments based on changes in a pre-determined inflation index, mitigating the erosion of purchasing power.
2.  The interest received on IIBs is tax-exempt, making them an attractive investment option for individuals seeking both inflation protection and tax benefits.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from the negative effects of inflation.  The core feature of IIBs is that their principal and/or interest payments are adjusted based on a specific inflation index (usually the Consumer Price Index). This adjustment ensures that the real return on the investment remains relatively stable, even if inflation rises.  This directly addresses the risk of inflation eroding the purchasing power of the investment. Therefore, statement 1 accurately describes a key characteristic and benefit of IIBs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While IIBs offer inflation protection, the tax treatment of the interest earned on IIBs is not universally tax-exempt.  The tax implications vary depending on the specific design of the bond and the applicable tax laws of the issuing country.  In many jurisdictions, including India, the interest earned on IIBs is subject to income tax, although capital gains might have different treatment.  Therefore, relying on tax exemption as a key feature of IIBs is an inaccurate generalization.


**4. With reference to the impact of US Federal Reserve's monetary policy on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (raising interest rates) tends to attract capital inflows into the US, potentially leading to capital flight from India as investors seek higher returns in the US.
2. Capital flight from India can lead to an appreciation of the Indian rupee, as the demand for the rupee decreases in the international markets.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

When the US Federal Reserve adopts a tight monetary policy by raising interest rates, it makes US assets more attractive to global investors seeking higher returns.  This increased attractiveness can lead to capital outflows from other countries, including India, as investors shift their funds to the US market. This is a classic example of how international monetary policies are interconnected and can impact capital flows across borders. Statement 1 correctly reflects this mechanism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Capital flight from India, meaning a net outflow of capital, would actually lead to a *depreciation* of the Indian rupee, not an appreciation.  The increased supply of rupees in the foreign exchange market relative to the demand would put downward pressure on the rupee's value. The other options are also incorrect because they misinterpret the relationship between US monetary policy, capital flows, and the impact on the Indian rupee.


**5. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Convertible bonds offer a lower interest rate compared to traditional bonds because they provide the bondholder with the option to convert the bond into equity shares of the issuing company.
2. The option to convert convertible bonds into equity offers the bondholder a degree of protection against inflation, as the value of equity shares often rises with inflation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Convertible bonds are hybrid instruments that combine features of both debt and equity.  Because they offer the option to convert into equity, they generally carry a lower interest rate than traditional, non-convertible bonds.  Investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate because they have the potential to benefit from equity appreciation if the company performs well and the share price increases.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this trade-off between interest rate and conversion option.

Statement 2 is also correct, although it needs some qualification.  The equity component of convertible bonds does offer some degree of inflation protection.  If the company's earnings grow in line with or faster than inflation, the value of the underlying equity shares is likely to increase, offsetting some of the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation.  However, this protection is not guaranteed, as equity values are subject to market forces and are not directly tied to inflation in a predictable way.  Despite this caveat, the potential for equity appreciation to hedge against inflation is a significant feature of convertible bonds.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the dual nature of convertible bonds and their associated benefits.


**6. With reference to e-RUPI prepaid digital vouchers, consider the following statements:**

1. e-RUPI vouchers can be issued for a maximum value of one lakh rupees.
2.  Beneficiaries can receive and utilize e-RUPI vouchers even without possessing a bank account.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

e-RUPI is a digital payment system designed to facilitate cashless and contactless transactions.  While the specific value limits might vary depending on the implementation and the issuing authority, the statement about a one-lakh rupee limit is not universally true. This is a potentially misleading distractor, as the actual limit might be lower or higher depending on specific use cases and regulations.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key feature of e-RUPI is its ability to reach beneficiaries who may not have access to traditional banking systems.  The system is designed to be inclusive and accessible, making it possible to provide financial assistance or benefits even to those without bank accounts.  The voucher functions similarly to a prepaid card, delivering the funds directly to the beneficiary's mobile device for specific use at authorized merchants.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent a core feature of the e-RUPI system.


**7. With reference to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  NBFCs are not permitted to accept demand deposits, meaning they cannot offer checking accounts or similar services that allow for immediate withdrawals.
2.  NBFCs are not eligible for deposit insurance coverage provided by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), unlike banks.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are financial institutions that provide various financial services but are not regulated as banks.  A key distinction is their inability to accept demand deposits.  Banks can offer checking accounts and savings accounts that allow for immediate withdrawals on demand.  NBFCs, however, cannot offer such services, limiting their ability to take short-term liabilities.  This distinction is crucial in maintaining financial stability. Statement 1 correctly reflects this regulatory difference.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Deposit insurance schemes, such as the DICGC in India, typically cover deposits held in banks.  This protection safeguards depositors in case of bank failures.  NBFCs are not typically covered under such schemes, exposing investors to a higher degree of risk. This difference in regulatory protection highlights the distinction between banks and NBFCs.  The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately capture the regulatory distinctions between NBFCs and banks.


**8. With reference to the Indian banking system, consider the following statements:**

1. The nationalization of 14 major commercial banks in 1969 aimed to expand banking services to underserved sectors and prioritize lending to sectors aligned with national development goals.
2. The second wave of bank nationalization in 1980 further increased the public sector's dominance in the banking sector and reinforced the government's control over credit allocation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The nationalization of 14 major banks in 1969 was a landmark event in Indian economic history.  A primary objective was to expand banking reach to rural areas and underserved populations, ensuring access to credit for small businesses, farmers, and other sectors previously excluded from formal banking.  Furthermore, the nationalization aimed to align credit allocation with national development priorities, directing funds towards sectors deemed crucial for economic growth.  Statement 1 accurately captures these motivations.

The 1980 nationalization of six more banks further consolidated the public sector's control over the banking system.  This strengthened the government's ability to influence credit allocation and steer investment towards strategically important areas.  This second wave reinforced the social control over credit allocation, furthering the goals of reaching priority sectors.  Statement 2 correctly describes the outcome and intent of the second nationalization phase.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the two distinct phases of nationalization and their shared objectives.


**9. With reference to the objectives of monetary policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Maintaining price stability is the primary objective of monetary policy, with supporting economic growth as a secondary, albeit important, goal.
2. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considers currency market fluctuations (rupee appreciation/depreciation) as a key factor when determining the policy repo rate.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has evolved its monetary policy framework over time.  While supporting economic growth is a vital goal, maintaining price stability (controlling inflation) is now considered the primary objective.  This shift reflects a global trend towards prioritizing price stability as a foundation for sustainable economic growth.  A stable price environment fosters predictability, encourages investment, and reduces uncertainty in the economy.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this prioritization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The MPC's primary focus is on inflation and growth. While exchange rate stability is important for overall macroeconomic stability, the MPC does *not* directly use currency market fluctuations as a primary determinant of the policy repo rate.  The RBI employs other instruments, such as intervention in the foreign exchange market, to manage exchange rate volatility.   The repo rate is primarily a tool for managing inflation and liquidity within the economy. The other options are incorrect as they misrepresent the primary focus of the MPC's monetary policy decisions.


**10. With reference to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 (FRBMA), consider the following statements:**

1. The FRBMA mandates the central government to achieve a revenue surplus by a specified deadline and maintain it thereafter, aiming for fiscal prudence and sustainability.
2. The FRBMA requires the central government to reduce both the fiscal deficit and revenue deficit by pre-defined annual targets, with adjustments to be made primarily through expenditure cuts if revenue targets are not met.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FRBMA, 2003, was a significant step towards fiscal consolidation in India.  A key mandate was to progressively reduce fiscal imbalances and, eventually, achieve a revenue surplus. This surplus signifies that the government's revenue receipts exceed its revenue expenditure, indicating a healthy fiscal position.  The Act aimed to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability and reduce reliance on borrowing.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this core objective.

The FRBMA also incorporated quantitative targets for reducing both fiscal and revenue deficits. If the revenue targets were not achieved through increased tax revenue, the necessary adjustments had to be made by cutting government expenditure. This mechanism aimed to ensure fiscal discipline and prevent excessive borrowing.  Statement 2 correctly reflects the FRBMA's emphasis on target-based fiscal consolidation and the prioritization of expenditure control.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to capture the key provisions of the FRBMA related to revenue surplus and deficit reduction targets.


**1. With reference to e-RUPI, consider the following statements:**

1. e-RUPI is a digital currency that can be used for various transactions.
2. e-RUPI requires a smartphone with internet access for both issuance and redemption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. e-RUPI is not a digital currency; it's a prepaid digital voucher.  It functions as a cashless and contactless payment system for specific purposes and beneficiaries, unlike a general-purpose digital currency. It cannot be used for all transactions.  The key difference lies in its restricted usage and lack of fungibility with other forms of currency.  It's designed for targeted delivery of benefits, not as a replacement for regular currency transactions.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While a smartphone is often used to receive the e-RUPI voucher (via QR code or SMS), internet access is *not* required for redemption. The voucher can be redeemed at designated centers simply by showing the QR code or SMS. This feature is specifically designed to ensure accessibility even for those without internet connectivity, promoting financial inclusion.  The system prioritizes ease of use and accessibility for all beneficiaries, regardless of their technological proficiency.


**2. With reference to Scheduled Commercial Banks in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Scheduled banks are those included in the Second Schedule of the RBI Act, 1934, and must have a minimum paid-up share capital of ₹500 crore.
2.  Non-scheduled banks in India are permitted to undertake all banking activities, including foreign exchange dealings, subject to meeting reserve requirements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The definition of a scheduled bank is explicitly tied to inclusion in the Second Schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.  Furthermore,  a minimum paid-up share capital is a criterion for being a scheduled bank, ensuring a certain level of financial strength and stability within the banking system.  This criterion helps maintain the credibility and solvency of scheduled banks in India.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Non-scheduled banks operate under limitations compared to scheduled banks.  They are not allowed to deal in foreign exchange and their operations are significantly restricted.  While they do have reserve requirements (under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949), these are not necessarily maintained with the RBI, unlike scheduled banks, indicating a difference in regulatory oversight and operational scope.  The difference in regulatory oversight significantly impacts the operational scale and the range of services offered by these banks.


**3. With reference to the Indian Financial System, consider the following statements:**

1.  All Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are regulated solely by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) are owned equally by the Central Government, the concerned State Government, and the sponsor bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  UCBs are subject to dual regulation. While the RBI regulates and supervises their banking functions, including amalgamation and liquidation, the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies/Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies oversees non-banking aspects such as registration, management, administration, and recruitment. This dual regulatory framework reflects the unique nature of UCBs as cooperative entities operating within the broader banking system.


Statement 2 is incorrect. RRBs are not owned equally. The ownership structure is a tiered system: 50% by the Central Government, 15% by the concerned State Government, and 35% by the sponsor bank. This specific ownership structure highlights the collaborative nature of RRBs, with shared responsibility between the government and a commercial sponsor bank, aimed at addressing the credit needs of the rural sector. The unequal shareholdings reflect differing levels of involvement and risk-bearing amongst the stakeholders.


**4. With reference to the components of money supply in India, consider the following statements:**

1. M1, which includes currency with the public and demand deposits, is considered narrow money.
2. M3, the broadest measure of money supply, encompasses all components of M1, M2, and M4.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. M1, consisting of currency with the public and demand deposits, is indeed considered narrow money. This is because these components are the most liquid and directly available for transactions. The narrow definition reflects the immediate transactional capacity of this segment of the money supply.


Statement 2 is incorrect. M3, while a broader measure than M1, does *not* encompass all components of M2 and M4. The hierarchy is M1 < M2 < M3 < M4. Each successive measure includes the previous one plus additional less liquid components.  M3 includes M1 and net time deposits of commercial banks, while M4 adds post office savings organization deposits. Therefore, M3 does not include all aspects of M4. The hierarchical structure reflects varying degrees of liquidity within the overall money supply.


**5. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. Remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are recorded under the capital account of the BoP.
2. India's current account convertibility implies that the rupee is fully convertible for all transactions under the current account.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Remittances from NRIs are recorded under the *current* account, not the capital account, of the BoP.  This is because remittances represent a transfer of income, not a change in ownership or investment.  They are considered unilateral transfers and thus are part of the current account balance.  The current account focuses on transactions related to goods, services, and income flows, whereas the capital account deals with financial flows like investments.


Statement 2 is correct. India does have full current account convertibility. This means that the rupee is freely convertible into other currencies for transactions related to the current account.  This convertibility is a crucial aspect of India's integration into the global economy, facilitating international trade and financial flows under the current account.  However, capital account convertibility remains partially restricted, indicating a distinction between the free flow of goods and services versus the controlled flow of capital.


**6. With reference to  the functions of money, consider the following statements:**

1. Money serves only as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions between individuals and businesses.
2. Money acts as a store of value, preserving purchasing power over time, although its value may fluctuate due to inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but incomplete. While money is primarily a medium of exchange, simplifying transactions, it also serves other vital functions.  Reducing the need for barter systems is a key function, but it is not the only one.  The statement ignores the other important roles that money plays in an economy.


Statement 2 is correct. Money does act as a store of value, allowing individuals and businesses to save purchasing power for future use. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that the value of money can erode due to inflation.  This inherent vulnerability to inflation is a key limitation of money as a store of value.  Despite this limitation, its role in facilitating savings and investments remains significant.  The statement accurately reflects this dual nature of money as a store of value.


**7. With reference to  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's primary objective is solely to maintain price stability, irrespective of other macroeconomic factors.
2. The RBI's Economic Capital Framework (ECF) aims to allocate funds to capital reserves to handle financial crises and transfer profits to the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While maintaining price stability is a crucial objective of the RBI, it also considers other macroeconomic factors like economic growth and employment.  The RBI's monetary policy strives for a balance between price stability and other economic goals, reflecting the complex interplay of factors influencing the economy.  The statement oversimplifies the RBI's mandate by focusing only on price stability.


Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's ECF is designed to manage risk and ensure its financial stability.  A sufficient capital reserve is maintained to handle contingencies and financial crises.  The remaining net income is then transferred to the government as profit, reflecting the RBI's role as a government institution. The statement accurately describes the dual purpose of the ECF: risk mitigation and profit distribution.


**8. With reference to  cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), consider the following statements:**

1. Cryptocurrencies are legal tender issued by central banks and are fully regulated.
2. CBDCs aim to provide a digital alternative to fiat currency, offering benefits like faster transactions and reduced reliance on cash.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender issued by central banks; they are decentralized digital assets not backed by any government or central authority.  They operate outside the traditional financial regulatory framework, unlike fiat currencies. The statement fundamentally misrepresents the nature and regulatory status of cryptocurrencies.


Statement 2 is correct. CBDCs are indeed digital forms of fiat currency issued by central banks.  They are designed to offer several benefits, including faster and more efficient transactions, reduced reliance on physical cash, and improved financial inclusion.  The statement accurately reflects the core purpose and advantages of CBDCs.  The statement is a concise and accurate summary of the key objectives of CBDCs.


**9. With reference to  the Indian banking sector reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. The nationalization of banks in 1969 and 1980 aimed primarily to increase profitability and efficiency in the banking sector.
2.  Post-1991 reforms in the Indian banking sector focused on deregulation, increased competition, and strengthening risk management practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While increased reach and access to credit were outcomes, the primary aims of bank nationalization were to direct credit towards priority sectors (agriculture, small-scale industries) and to align banking practices with national development goals, rather than to improve profitability and efficiency in the short term.  The statement misrepresents the primary motivations behind bank nationalization.


Statement 2 is correct. Post-1991 reforms in the Indian banking sector were indeed aimed at deregulation, promoting competition, and improving risk management.   These reforms aimed to modernize the banking sector, increase its efficiency, and integrate it more effectively with the global financial system. The statement accurately reflects the core components of the post-1991 banking sector reforms.  The statement accurately captures the essence of the changes introduced.


**10. With reference to  Systemically Important Institutions (SIIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Only banks are designated as Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The designation of SIIs aims to mitigate risks associated with their potential failure and to enhance market discipline.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI designates not only banks as DSIBs but also Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and other financial institutions are designated as SIIs by their respective regulatory bodies (IRDAI for insurers, SEBI for financial market infrastructure).  The statement fails to acknowledge the broader scope of SIIs beyond just banks.


Statement 2 is correct. The designation of SIIs is indeed intended to address the risks associated with their potential failure, as their size and interconnectedness could have significant systemic consequences.  Additional regulatory measures and enhanced supervision are employed to strengthen their resilience and to prevent any contagion effects on the financial system. The statement accurately highlights the key rationale behind the SIIs designation.  The statement appropriately reflects the overall aim of the SIIs framework.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer, a detailed explanation, and analysis of distractors.


**1. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy tools, consider the following statements:**

1.  A high inflation rate prompts the RBI to sell government securities in the open market to reduce the money supply.
2.  If the Indian Rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to purchase dollars in the foreign exchange market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Open market operations (OMO) are a crucial component of RBI's monetary policy.  When inflation is high, the RBI employs contractionary monetary policy. Selling government securities reduces the money supply in the banking system, thus curbing inflationary pressures. This is because banks use their reserves to purchase these securities, reducing their lending capacity and subsequently reducing the overall money supply.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A rapidly depreciating Rupee indicates a weakening of the domestic currency. To counter this, the RBI would typically *sell* dollars from its foreign exchange reserves. This increases the supply of dollars in the market, potentially increasing demand for Rupees and thus supporting its value. Purchasing dollars would exacerbate the depreciation.  This intervention aims to manage exchange rate volatility and maintain macroeconomic stability.  The RBI's actions are aimed at influencing the exchange rate, not necessarily to directly profit from currency trading.


**2. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  IIBs allow the government to borrow at lower coupon rates because they offer investors protection against inflation.
2.  The interest received and capital gains from IIBs are tax-exempt in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation.  The principal and interest payments on IIBs are adjusted based on an inflation index (like CPI). This feature allows the government to offer lower initial coupon rates compared to conventional bonds, as the inflation adjustment mitigates the investor's inflation risk.  This makes IIBs attractive to risk-averse investors, enabling the government to borrow at more favorable terms.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While IIBs offer protection against inflation, the interest earned and capital gains are generally *taxable* in India. The tax treatment of IIBs is subject to the prevailing income tax laws, and there is no specific exemption for these bonds compared to other debt instruments.  Tax implications are an important consideration for investors when evaluating IIBs.


**3. With reference to the impact of US Federal Reserve policies on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve is likely to lead to capital outflow from India.
2.  A devaluation of the Indian Rupee reduces the currency risk associated with External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve usually involves increasing interest rates.  Higher interest rates in the US make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to global investors. This can lead to capital outflow from emerging markets like India as investors shift their funds to the US seeking higher returns. This capital flight can put pressure on the Indian Rupee and potentially impact the country's financial markets.

Statement 2 is correct.  External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) are loans taken by Indian entities from foreign lenders.  A devaluation of the Rupee means that the Indian borrower needs fewer Rupees to repay the dollar-denominated loan. This reduces the currency risk for the Indian borrower, as the cost of repayment in Rupee terms decreases. However, this benefit is offset by the increased cost of importing goods and services.


**4. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Convertible bonds typically offer lower interest rates than comparable non-convertible bonds due to the option to convert them into equity.
2. The conversion option in convertible bonds provides investors with some protection against inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Convertible bonds offer the bondholder the option to convert the bond into equity shares of the issuing company at a specified price and time.  This option adds value to the bond, allowing the issuer to offer a lower interest rate than a comparable non-convertible bond.  The potential upside from equity participation compensates for the lower interest income.  This is a common feature in corporate finance to attract investors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While convertible bonds offer some potential for capital appreciation if the company's share price rises, they do not inherently provide protection against inflation. The value of the bond, and the eventual equity shares, can still be eroded by inflation.  The inclusion of this statement serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuances of convertible bonds.  The value of the equity obtained through conversion is subject to market forces and is not directly linked to an inflation index.


**5. With reference to Demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following factors:**

1.  Expansionary fiscal policies, characterized by increased government spending, can contribute to demand-pull inflation.
2.  Rising interest rates directly cause demand-pull inflation by stimulating increased borrowing and spending.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Demand-pull inflation arises when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply. Expansionary fiscal policies, such as increased government spending or tax cuts, boost aggregate demand. If the economy's productive capacity cannot keep pace with this increased demand, prices rise, leading to inflation. This is a fundamental concept in macroeconomic theory.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rising interest rates have the opposite effect on demand-pull inflation. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to finance spending. This reduces aggregate demand and helps to curb inflationary pressures.  The statement misrepresents the relationship between interest rates and demand-pull inflation, serving as a key distractor.  Rising interest rates are a tool used to *combat* demand-pull inflation.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on economic concepts and their application, mirroring the style and complexity expected in the UPSC exam.  Note that the difficulty is inherently high due to the requirement of precise factual recall and the inclusion of sophisticated distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Paradox of Thrift suggests that an increase in the marginal propensity to save (MPS) always leads to a proportional increase in aggregate savings within an economy.
2.  In a Keynesian model with a fixed price and interest rate, a decrease in the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) causes a downward swing of the aggregate demand (AD) line, potentially resulting in a decrease in equilibrium output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Paradox of Thrift demonstrates the counter-intuitive outcome where increased individual saving behavior does *not* necessarily lead to higher aggregate savings.  This is because reduced consumption spending due to higher MPS decreases aggregate demand, leading to lower overall output and potentially lower aggregate savings. The multiplier effect plays a crucial role here; the decrease in aggregate demand outweighs the increase in savings.

Statement 2 is correct. A decrease in MPC (which is equivalent to an increase in MPS) reduces the slope of the AD curve in a Keynesian model with fixed prices and interest rates.  This downward swing of the AD curve implies that for any given level of output, aggregate demand is lower.  The economy moves to a new equilibrium with lower output and income. The reduction in consumption spending directly impacts aggregate demand, resulting in an excess supply. Producers respond by reducing output, further impacting income and creating a multiplier effect that drives the economy to a new, lower equilibrium.  This is a core concept in Keynesian economics and demonstrates the interdependence of consumption, investment, and output in determining the equilibrium.


**2. With reference to the concept of the output multiplier, consider the following statements:**

1. The output multiplier is the ratio of the total increment in equilibrium final goods output to the initial increment in autonomous investment.
2. The size of the output multiplier is inversely related to the marginal propensity to consume (MPC); a lower MPC results in a larger multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The output multiplier precisely measures the amplification of an initial change in autonomous spending (like investment) on the overall equilibrium level of output.  A small initial increase in autonomous spending can lead to a much larger increase in overall output through the multiplier effect. This effect is due to the cyclical nature of spending – increased income leads to increased consumption, which further increases income, and so on.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The relationship between the multiplier and MPC is *directly* proportional, not inverse. A higher MPC implies a larger multiplier.  A higher MPC means that a larger fraction of any increase in income is spent on consumption, leading to a more significant ripple effect on aggregate demand and thus a larger increase in overall output.  The formula for the multiplier (1/(1-MPC)) clearly demonstrates this direct relationship. A lower MPC leads to a smaller multiplier.


**3. With reference to the Indian economy's GDP calculation methodology, consider the following statements:**

1. Before 2015, India's GDP was primarily calculated at factor cost, excluding indirect taxes and subsidies.
2. Since January 2015, the National Statistical Office (NSO) has adopted the calculation of GDP at market prices, in line with international best practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the shift in India's GDP calculation methodology.  Before 2015, the GDP calculation primarily used factor cost, which represents the value added at each stage of production without considering indirect taxes and subsidies. This method, while simpler in some ways, didn't fully reflect the market value of goods and services.  The shift to market prices in 2015 aligns India's GDP data with international standards, providing a more comprehensive and comparable measure of economic activity. The change was implemented by the NSO under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), reflecting the adoption of global best practices advocated by international organizations like the IMF.


**4. With reference to the components of India's GDP, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at market price is calculated by summing the Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices and adding indirect taxes, and then subtracting subsidies.
2.  In calculating GDP at market prices, land revenue is considered a production tax and railway subsidies are considered production subsidies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The GDP at market prices is derived from GVA at basic prices by incorporating indirect taxes (which increase the market price) and subtracting subsidies (which reduce the market price).  This approach ensures that the final GDP figure accurately reflects the total market value of goods and services produced within the country's borders.

Statement 2 is also correct. Land revenue is indeed a type of production tax, and railway subsidies are a type of production subsidy in the context of GDP calculations. These are included as adjustments to the GVA at basic prices to arrive at the GVA at factor cost, and subsequently to the GDP at market prices.  While the net impact of production taxes and subsidies might be small compared to other components, their inclusion is crucial for accuracy.


**5. With reference to  the concept of potential GDP, consider the following statements:**

1. Potential GDP represents the real value of goods and services produced when all factors of production are fully employed, and it is subject to significant fluctuations due to business cycle swings.
2.  Recessions are periods of significant decline in total output, income, and employment, typically lasting 6 to 18 months, and are always characterized by at least two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth as measured by real GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that potential GDP represents the maximum sustainable output level with full factor employment; however, it is *not* subject to significant fluctuations due to business cycles. The business cycle affects *actual* GDP, which may deviate above or below potential GDP. Potential GDP represents the long-term trend growth of the economy, whereas the actual GDP fluctuates around this trend.

Statement 2 is correct and provides a technically accurate definition of a recession. While two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth are a commonly used indicator, it is not the sole defining criterion. The duration, severity, and breadth of the economic contraction across different sectors are also considered.  A severe and prolonged recession is termed a depression.


**6.  With reference to exchange rate systems, consider the following statements:**

1.  A managed float exchange rate system implies that the central bank never intervenes in the foreign exchange market; the currency price is entirely determined by market forces.
2.  Devaluation of a currency is undertaken to correct an adverse balance of payments situation, making exports cheaper and imports more expensive.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A managed float system allows the exchange rate to fluctuate based on market forces, but the central bank *does* intervene to manage volatility or to achieve specific economic policy goals.  Interventions might involve buying or selling foreign currencies to influence the exchange rate. A free float system is where there is no intervention.

Statement 2 is correct. Devaluation is a deliberate policy decision by a government to reduce the value of its currency relative to other currencies. This is a tool used to improve a country's trade balance by making its exports more competitive in the global market and imports relatively more expensive.  This can help address a balance of payments deficit.


**7. With reference to the functions of money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money acts as a medium of exchange, eliminating the need for a double coincidence of wants, which is essential for barter systems to function efficiently.
2.  Money serves as a store of value, but its effectiveness in this role is compromised if there is high and sustained inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of money.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe crucial functions of money in an economy.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the primary function of money: to facilitate transactions by eliminating the cumbersome requirement of a double coincidence of wants inherent in barter systems.  This allows for specialization and efficient allocation of resources.

Statement 2 also correctly points out that while money serves as a store of value, its effectiveness is diminished under conditions of high inflation.  Inflation erodes the real value of money held over time, reducing its ability to maintain purchasing power. This can lead to a shift away from holding money as a store of value toward alternative assets that hold their value better in inflationary environments.


**8. Consider the following statements:**

1.  In an open economy, the aggregate demand for domestic goods is equal to domestic demand plus net exports (exports minus imports).
2. The open economy multiplier is larger than the closed economy multiplier because a portion of increased domestic demand falls on foreign goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In an open economy, aggregate demand includes not only domestic consumption, investment, and government spending but also net exports.  Net exports represent the demand for domestic goods from foreign countries (exports) minus the demand for foreign goods by domestic consumers (imports).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The open economy multiplier is *smaller* than the closed economy multiplier. This is because some portion of increased spending leaks out of the domestic economy as imports, reducing the overall multiplier effect on domestic output and income.  The leakage of spending into imports reduces the cyclical nature of spending within the domestic economy.  The multiplier is smaller in an open economy because the increased demand is split between domestic and foreign goods.


**9. With reference to the relationship between savings, investment, and trade balance, consider the following statements:**

1. In a closed economy, savings and investment must always be equal.
2. In an open economy, a trade deficit implies that national savings are greater than domestic investment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  In a closed economy without international trade, savings must equal investment. This is because all income generated within the economy must either be consumed or saved.  Savings provide the funds for investment, ensuring that the two are always in balance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. In an open economy, a trade deficit implies that national savings are *less than* domestic investment.  The difference is financed by capital inflows from abroad (a capital account surplus).  A trade deficit means the country is importing more than it is exporting; to finance this difference, it must borrow from abroad, representing an increase in investment financed by foreign savings.  The equation S = I + NX (where S is national savings, I is investment, and NX is net exports) clearly shows that a trade deficit (NX < 0) implies S < I.


**1. With reference to the functioning of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  If inflation is excessively high, the RBI is likely to purchase government securities to increase money supply and stimulate the economy.
2.  If the Indian rupee is rapidly depreciating against other currencies, the RBI is likely to sell its dollar reserves in the foreign exchange market to support the rupee's value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  When inflation is high, the RBI typically adopts a *contractionary* monetary policy to curb inflation. This involves actions like *increasing* interest rates or selling government securities to reduce the money supply, thereby decreasing aggregate demand and cooling down inflationary pressures. Buying government securities would have the opposite effect, exacerbating inflation.  This is a fundamental principle of monetary policy management.

Statement 2 is correct. A rapidly depreciating rupee indicates a weakening of the domestic currency in the foreign exchange market. To counter this, the RBI would intervene by selling its foreign exchange reserves (primarily dollars) to increase the supply of rupees in the market. This increased supply would, in theory, increase the demand for rupees and thus support its value against other currencies. This is a standard tool used by central banks to manage exchange rates, particularly in situations of rapid depreciation.  The RBI's foreign exchange reserves act as a buffer against such market fluctuations.


**2. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  IIBs allow the government to reduce coupon rates on its borrowings because the principal and interest payments are adjusted for inflation, reducing the real cost of borrowing.
2.  IIBs provide investors with protection against unexpected inflation, as the returns are adjusted to reflect changes in the price level, ensuring that the real value of their investment is maintained.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) offer a significant advantage to governments by allowing them to offer lower coupon rates. Since the principal and interest payments are adjusted for inflation, the *real* cost of borrowing for the government is reduced. This is because the government doesn't have to compensate investors for the erosion of the value of their investment due to inflation. This makes IIBs an attractive option for governments looking to manage their debt burden effectively.

Statement 2 is also correct. The primary benefit of IIBs for investors is protection against inflation risk. The principal and interest payments are indexed to a measure of inflation (like the CPI), ensuring that the real return on the investment remains relatively stable even if the general price level rises.  This makes IIBs a valuable tool for risk-averse investors seeking to preserve the purchasing power of their investments over the long term.  This feature makes them especially attractive in inflationary environments.


**3. With reference to the impact of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (like raising interest rates) can lead to capital flight from India, as investors seek higher returns in the US.
2.  Capital flight from India due to US Federal Reserve actions can increase the interest cost for Indian firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), as the demand for funds increases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The US Federal Reserve's monetary policy significantly impacts global capital flows. A "tight" monetary policy, characterized by higher interest rates in the US, makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive to international investors. This can lead to capital flight from emerging markets like India, as investors withdraw their investments to take advantage of higher returns in the US. This outflow of capital can put downward pressure on the value of the Indian rupee and impact the availability of funds in the Indian market.

Statement 2 is also correct. If capital flees India due to US Federal Reserve actions, the demand for funds in the Indian market may increase (as borrowers still need funds). This increased demand, in a situation where the supply of funds has decreased, can lead to higher interest rates for borrowers. Indian firms with existing ECBs may find their borrowing costs increase as lenders adjust their rates to reflect the higher risk and increased demand for capital. This demonstrates the interconnectedness of global financial markets and the impact of US monetary policy on other economies.


**4. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Convertible bonds offer a lower interest rate than traditional bonds because they provide the bondholder with the option to convert the bond into equity shares of the issuing company.
2. The option to convert to equity in convertible bonds offers bondholders a degree of protection against rising inflation, as the value of the equity shares may increase with inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Convertible bonds typically offer a lower interest rate compared to traditional, non-convertible bonds. This is because the embedded option to convert into equity provides an additional potential return for the investor, compensating for the lower coupon rate. The lower interest rate reflects the value of the conversion option.  This is a key feature that makes convertible bonds attractive to investors.

Statement 2 is also correct. While not a direct inflation hedge like an IIB, the conversion feature of convertible bonds offers some degree of inflation protection. If inflation rises, the underlying company's earnings and the value of its shares may also rise (depending on the company's ability to pass on increased costs).  The bondholder can then exercise their option to convert their bond into equity shares, potentially benefiting from the increased share value. Therefore, the convertible bond provides a form of indirect inflation protection, although the level of protection is not guaranteed and depends heavily on the performance of the issuing company.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy's openness, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ratio of total foreign trade (exports plus imports) to GDP is a common indicator used to measure the degree of openness of an economy.
2.  India's foreign trade as a proportion of GDP increased significantly between 1985-86 and 2004-05, indicating a growing integration into the global economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ratio of a country's total foreign trade (the sum of exports and imports) to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) serves as a widely accepted metric for gauging the extent of its economic openness. A higher ratio suggests greater integration with the global economy through increased participation in international trade.  This indicator reflects the significance of international trade relative to the overall size of the domestic economy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  India's participation in global trade has demonstrably expanded over the period mentioned. The proportion of foreign trade to GDP increased substantially between 1985-86 and 2004-05, reflecting a significant rise in both exports and imports. This growth reflects India's liberalization policies, which aimed to integrate the Indian economy more deeply into the global marketplace.  This increased openness has had both positive and negative consequences for the Indian economy, impacting various sectors and requiring careful policy management.


**6. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. The current account of the BoP includes trade in goods and services, as well as transfer payments (like remittances and foreign aid).
2. A current account deficit necessarily implies that a country is financing this deficit by either selling assets or borrowing from abroad, leading to a net capital inflow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The current account of the Balance of Payments (BoP) is a crucial component that records transactions related to the trade of goods and services. This includes visible trade (exports and imports of goods) and invisible trade (exports and imports of services).  In addition, it encompasses transfer payments, which are one-way flows of funds without any expectation of repayment, such as remittances from citizens working abroad or foreign aid received.  The current account balance reflects a country's net flow of income from its international transactions.

Statement 2 is also correct. A current account deficit signifies that a country's spending on imports of goods and services, along with net transfer payments, exceeds its earnings from exports.  To finance this shortfall, the country must obtain funds from external sources. This typically occurs through either selling assets (like foreign investments) to foreign entities or by borrowing funds from abroad.  The net effect is a capital inflow that offsets the current account deficit.  The magnitude of the capital inflow required directly corresponds to the size of the current account deficit. This relationship is a fundamental principle of international finance.


**7. With reference to the foreign exchange market, consider the following statements:**

1. The exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another currency.  A bilateral nominal exchange rate is the exchange rate for one currency against another, quoted in money terms.
2. The real exchange rate is a measure that considers the relative prices of goods and services in two countries, taking into account the nominal exchange rate, to assess the purchasing power of currencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The exchange rate is indeed the price at which one national currency can be exchanged for another. The bilateral nominal exchange rate specifically refers to the exchange rate between two individual currencies, typically expressed as a certain amount of one currency equal to one unit of the other (e.g., USD/INR).  This is the most common way exchange rates are quoted and used in daily transactions. The nominal exchange rate does not consider the relative purchasing power of the currencies.

Statement 2 is also correct. The real exchange rate goes beyond the nominal exchange rate by incorporating the relative price levels of goods and services in the two countries involved. It adjusts the nominal exchange rate for differences in purchasing power parity (PPP), providing a more accurate reflection of the relative cost of goods and services across borders.  The real exchange rate helps in comparing the purchasing power of currencies and understanding the competitiveness of a country's exports in international markets.  A real exchange rate of 1 suggests purchasing power parity – goods cost the same in both countries when measured in the same currency.


**8. With reference to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) of 2003, consider the following statements:**

1. The FRBM Act mandates the central government to take measures to progressively reduce both the fiscal deficit and revenue deficit, aiming for a revenue surplus.
2. The FRBM Act strictly prohibits the central government from borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A key objective of the FRBM Act is to ensure fiscal prudence and sustainability by imposing limits on government borrowing.  The Act mandates that the central government should progressively reduce both the fiscal deficit (the difference between total expenditure and total receipts) and the revenue deficit (the difference between revenue receipts and revenue expenditure). The ultimate goal is to achieve a revenue surplus, meaning that revenue receipts exceed revenue expenditure. This shows a commitment towards responsible fiscal management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the FRBM Act aims to reduce the government's reliance on borrowing from the RBI, it does *not* completely prohibit it.  The Act allows for borrowing from the RBI under specific exceptional circumstances, such as to meet temporary cash flow mismatches (i.e., when cash disbursements exceed cash receipts).  This exception is designed to provide the government with some flexibility in managing short-term liquidity needs.  The intent is to minimize the government’s dependence on the RBI as a source of funding, but it’s not entirely eliminated.


**9.  With reference to the components of the Government of India's budget, consider the following statements:**

1.  Expenditure on the acquisition of assets like roads, buildings, and machinery is classified as capital expenditure.
2.  Loans received from foreign governments are included in the revenue budget of the Government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Capital expenditure refers to government spending that results in the creation of assets.  This includes investment in infrastructure (roads, buildings), machinery, and other durable goods that will provide benefits over an extended period. These assets contribute to the country's productive capacity and are considered long-term investments.  The distinction between capital and revenue expenditure is crucial for understanding the government's fiscal position and its long-term impact on the economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Loans received from foreign governments are considered as *capital receipts* and are part of the capital budget, not the revenue budget.  Revenue receipts comprise tax revenues, non-tax revenues, and grants received from other governments (but not loans). Loans are considered capital receipts because they represent inflows of funds that do not need to be repaid immediately; they represent borrowing, not current income.  The capital budget reflects the government's investment activities and borrowing.


**10. With reference to the effects of Goods and Services Tax (GST) implementation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. GST replaced multiple indirect taxes levied by multiple authorities, leading to the creation of a unified national market in India.
2.  GST implementation significantly reduced India's current account deficit and led to a substantial increase in its foreign exchange reserves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The introduction of GST in India was a major tax reform that aimed to simplify the indirect tax system.  Prior to GST, there were multiple indirect taxes at the central and state levels, creating complexities and inefficiencies. GST replaced these with a single, unified indirect tax, resulting in a more streamlined and integrated national market. This simplification reduced compliance costs for businesses and promoted a more efficient flow of goods and services across state borders.  This was a landmark achievement in indirect tax reform.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While GST aimed to improve the efficiency of the economy and potentially boost exports, there's no direct causal link between GST implementation and a significant reduction in India's current account deficit or a substantial increase in foreign exchange reserves.  The current account deficit is influenced by a multitude of factors, including global commodity prices, export competitiveness, and capital flows.  While GST might indirectly influence these factors, it's not the primary driver of changes in the current account deficit or foreign exchange reserves.  Attributing such an impact solely to GST would be an oversimplification.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme primarily aims to provide financial assistance to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to enhance their operations and growth.
2.  It exclusively focuses on providing loans to women entrepreneurs, thereby promoting gender equality in the entrepreneurial landscape.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) is a government initiative designed to provide funding to micro and small enterprises.  The scheme aims to boost entrepreneurship and employment generation by providing financial access to individuals who may not qualify for traditional bank loans.  It offers various loan products catering to different business needs, significantly impacting the formal financial inclusion of small businesses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While MUDRA Yojana encourages women entrepreneurship and aims to empower women economically, it doesn't exclusively provide loans to women.  The scheme is open to all eligible individuals, regardless of gender, who meet the specified criteria for loan eligibility.  The scheme's focus is broader than just gender-based lending, encompassing the needs of a wider range of micro and small enterprises.


**2. With reference to the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both schemes aim to reduce India's dependence on gold imports by encouraging domestic gold mobilization.
2.  The Gold Monetization Scheme primarily focuses on attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are aimed at increasing the availability of gold within the Indian economy.  The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme offers an alternative investment option to physical gold, encouraging individuals to invest in government bonds denominated in gold, thereby reducing demand for physical gold imports. The Gold Monetization Scheme encourages individuals and institutions to deposit their idle gold holdings with banks and other authorized agencies, making this gold available for productive use within the country.  Both schemes indirectly reduce the need for gold imports.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Gold Monetization Scheme is not designed to attract FDI. Its primary purpose is to mobilize domestic gold resources for productive use, primarily by lending the deposited gold to jewelers and other industries, thereby reducing reliance on imported gold.  Attracting FDI is not a stated goal of this scheme; the focus remains squarely on domestic gold mobilization.


**3. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  NPCI’s primary objective is to facilitate interbank transactions and promote financial inclusion through initiatives such as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
2.  NPCI is solely responsible for the regulation and oversight of all payment systems in India, including those operated by private entities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NPCI plays a crucial role in facilitating interbank transactions and promoting financial inclusion within India. It operates various payment systems, including the widely used UPI, aimed at making digital payments more accessible and convenient for a broader population.  This has a direct impact on financial inclusion by enabling individuals and businesses to participate more effectively in the formal financial system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NPCI operates several prominent payment systems, it is not the sole regulator of all payment systems in India. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the primary regulatory authority for payment systems and oversees the overall functioning of the payment infrastructure. NPCI operates under the guidelines and regulations set by the RBI, and its activities are subject to RBI oversight.  Other private entities also operate payment systems within the regulatory framework established by the RBI.


**4. With reference to Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SFBs are specifically mandated to cater to the financial needs of small businesses, including micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
2.  SFBs are prohibited from offering any services related to large corporate clients or high-net-worth individuals (HNIs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. SFBs are designed to address the financial needs of underserved segments of the population, primarily focusing on micro and small businesses.  They provide credit and other financial services tailored to the requirements of small businesses, promoting entrepreneurship and economic growth within these segments.  Their mandate is to reach individuals and businesses that are typically underserved by larger commercial banks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While SFBs primarily focus on small businesses and individuals, they are not entirely prohibited from engaging with larger clients.  They can offer services to large corporate clients and HNIs within defined limits and regulatory guidelines.  The restrictions are not absolute; they exist to ensure that SFBs maintain their focus on small businesses and individuals while also allowing for some level of diversification within their operations.  The specific limits and guidelines are determined by the regulatory authorities.


**5. With reference to the term "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1.  MDR represents the fee charged to a merchant by a bank for accepting payments from customers using the bank's debit cards.
2.  MDR is a fixed percentage applied uniformly across all types of debit card transactions, regardless of the transaction value or the merchant's category.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MDR is a fee that banks charge merchants for processing debit card payments. This fee covers the costs associated with processing the transaction, including the bank's infrastructure, security measures, and network fees.  The MDR is a key component of the overall cost structure for merchants accepting digital payments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. MDR is not a fixed percentage applied uniformly across all debit card transactions. The MDR varies based on several factors, including the type of card (credit or debit, domestic or international), the transaction value, and the merchant category code (MCC) assigned to the merchant's business.  The MDR structure is dynamic and is subject to change based on market conditions and regulatory decisions.  Smaller merchants often receive preferential rates to encourage wider adoption of digital payments.


**6. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Legal tender money is any form of money that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of debts.
2.  In India, all forms of money, including cheques and bank drafts, are considered legal tender.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Legal tender refers to the currency that a creditor must accept as payment for a debt. This legal obligation ensures that the currency maintains its value and facilitates transactions within the economy.  The legal tender status is typically granted by the government to specific forms of currency issued by the central bank.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While banknotes and coins issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are legal tender in India, other forms of money, such as cheques and bank drafts, are not.  These instruments represent a promise to pay and are not inherently legal tender.  Their acceptance is based on trust and the contractual agreement between the parties involved, not a legal obligation.  Only specific forms of RBI-issued currency hold the legal tender status.


**7. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) functions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI manages and services both Central Government Securities and State Government Securities.
2.  Treasury bills are exclusively issued by the Central Government and not by State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI primarily manages and services Central Government Securities. While it may interact with State Governments on financial matters, its direct involvement in managing and servicing State Government Securities is limited. The management and servicing of State Government Securities is primarily handled by other designated agencies or banks.

Statement 2 is correct.  Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued by the Central Government to finance its short-term budgetary needs.  State Governments typically have their own mechanisms for raising short-term funds, which may not involve treasury bills in the same manner as the Central Government.  The issuance of treasury bills is a prerogative of the Central Government.


**8. With reference to the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), consider the following statements:**

1.  CAR is the minimum amount of capital that banks must maintain as a percentage of their risk-weighted assets to mitigate potential losses.
2.  The CAR is determined independently by each individual bank based on its own risk assessment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAR is a crucial regulatory requirement for banks globally, including in India.  It mandates that banks maintain a certain level of capital relative to their risk-weighted assets.  This capital acts as a buffer against potential losses from bad loans or other financial risks.  The CAR is a key indicator of a bank's financial strength and stability.  A higher CAR indicates greater resilience to potential shocks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAR is not determined independently by each bank.  It is set by regulatory authorities, such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in India, and is based on internationally accepted standards like Basel norms.  While banks may conduct their own internal risk assessments, the minimum CAR requirement is a regulatory mandate and is uniformly applied to all banks within a jurisdiction.  The RBI sets the minimum CAR requirement, and banks must meet or exceed this level.


**9. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Advances (loans) constitute a significant portion of a commercial bank's assets.
2.  Deposits held by customers are considered assets of the bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Advances, or loans given to customers by commercial banks, are a substantial part of their assets.  These loans generate interest income for the banks, contributing to their profitability.  The quality of a bank's loan portfolio is a key indicator of its financial health.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Deposits held by customers are liabilities for the bank, not assets. The bank owes this money to its depositors.  While deposits form the basis of a bank's lending capacity, they are recorded as liabilities on the bank's balance sheet.  Assets represent what the bank owns, while liabilities represent what the bank owes.


**10. With reference to factors influencing the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Remittances from Indians working abroad contribute positively to reducing currency crisis risks.
2.  Increasing government expenditure generally reduces the risk of a currency crisis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) represent a significant inflow of foreign exchange into India. This inflow helps bolster foreign exchange reserves, strengthening the rupee and reducing the vulnerability to currency crises.  A larger pool of foreign exchange reserves provides a buffer against external shocks and speculative attacks on the currency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Increasing government expenditure, particularly if it leads to a widening fiscal deficit and increased borrowing, can actually increase the risk of a currency crisis.  A large fiscal deficit can lead to higher inflation and a decline in investor confidence, potentially causing capital flight and pressure on the currency.  Fiscal prudence and responsible government spending are crucial for maintaining macroeconomic stability and reducing currency risks.  Excessive expenditure can lead to inflationary pressure and a weakening of the currency.


**11. With reference to measures taken by the Government/RBI to prevent the depreciation of the Indian rupee, consider the following statements:**

1.  Curbing imports of non-essential goods and promoting exports are common measures to support the rupee.
2.  Following an expansionary monetary policy, which involves lowering interest rates, generally strengthens the rupee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Reducing imports helps lower the demand for foreign currencies, particularly the US dollar, thus reducing downward pressure on the rupee. Simultaneously, promoting exports increases the supply of foreign exchange, further supporting the rupee's value. This is a standard approach to manage the balance of payments and support the domestic currency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy, characterized by lower interest rates, typically weakens a currency. Lower interest rates make it less attractive for foreign investors to hold the currency, leading to capital outflow and depreciation.  To strengthen the rupee, a contractionary monetary policy, involving higher interest rates, is more likely to be employed.  Higher interest rates attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the currency.


**12. With reference to factors influencing the money multiplier in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) leads to a higher money multiplier.
2.  An increase in the banking habit of the population leads to a higher money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CRR is the percentage of deposits that banks are required to hold with the central bank.  A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thereby lowering the money multiplier. The money multiplier is inversely related to the CRR.

Statement 2 is correct. An increase in the banking habit, meaning more people depositing money in banks, increases the money supply. Banks can lend out a larger fraction of these deposits, leading to a higher money multiplier effect.  A higher proportion of deposits in the banking system allows for greater lending and a larger money multiplier.


**13. With reference to actions/policies that can provide immunity to India during a global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1.  Not depending on short-term foreign borrowings reduces vulnerability to sudden capital flight.
2.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility enhances resilience during a crisis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Reliance on short-term foreign borrowings makes an economy vulnerable to sudden capital flight during a global financial crisis.  Short-term debt needs to be rolled over frequently, and if foreign investors lose confidence, they may withdraw their funds, causing a sharp decline in the currency and creating a financial crisis. Reducing reliance on short-term debt increases an economy's resilience to such events.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While capital account convertibility offers certain benefits under normal circumstances, it can expose an economy to greater volatility and risk during a global financial crisis.  Full capital account convertibility makes it easier for capital to flow in and out of a country, but during a crisis, this can lead to significant capital flight, putting immense pressure on the currency and financial system.  Some degree of capital control can be a useful tool during crises to manage capital flows and mitigate risks.


**14. With reference to the immediate effect of a large cash withdrawal from a demand deposit account, consider the following statements:**

1.  The aggregate money supply in the economy immediately decreases by the amount withdrawn.
2.  The withdrawal leads to a decrease in commercial banks' reserves, potentially impacting their lending capacity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the withdrawal reduces the money held directly by the individual, it does not immediately reduce the overall money supply.  The money simply changes hands; it moves from the bank's deposit account to the individual's possession. The overall money supply remains largely unchanged in the immediate aftermath of the withdrawal.  The money is still within the economy.

Statement 2 is correct. The withdrawal directly impacts the commercial bank's reserves.  This reduction in reserves might limit the bank's ability to lend further, potentially having a secondary impact on the money multiplier and the broader money supply over time.  However, the immediate effect is primarily on the bank's reserves, not the aggregate money supply.


**15. With reference to the purposes for which short-term credit support is given to farmers under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  KCC provides funds for the purchase of large farm machinery like combine harvesters and tractors.
2.  KCC covers post-harvest expenses, such as transportation and storage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While KCC can provide funds for purchasing some farm equipment, it does not typically cover large machinery like combine harvesters and tractors.  These are usually considered long-term investments and are not within the scope of short-term credit offered under KCC.  KCC primarily focuses on short-term needs related to crop production.

Statement 2 is correct.  Post-harvest expenses are a critical component of agricultural operations, and KCC provides support for these expenses, including transportation costs to markets and storage of harvested produce.  This helps farmers manage their finances effectively during the post-harvest phase.  The scheme is designed to cover the entire farming cycle, including post-harvest activities.


**16. With reference to financial instruments in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds.
2.  Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are long-term instruments issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to corporations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Commercial Paper (CP) is a money market instrument representing a short-term debt obligation issued by large and creditworthy corporations.  It is an unsecured promissory note, meaning it is not backed by any collateral.  CP is used by corporations to meet their short-term funding requirements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CDs are short-term borrowings issued by banks, not the RBI.  The RBI does not typically issue CDs to corporations.  CDs are issued by banks to raise short-term funds from the market.  They are a short-term debt instrument and are not issued by the central bank.


**17. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FDI primarily involves investment through capital instruments in listed companies.
2.  FDI is characterized by a largely non-debt-creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FDI can involve investments in listed companies, it's not limited to them.  FDI can also involve investments in unlisted companies, joint ventures, or the establishment of new subsidiaries.  The investment can take many forms beyond simply acquiring shares in listed entities.

Statement 2 is correct. FDI is fundamentally equity investment, representing ownership stakes in companies.  Unlike loans or other debt instruments, FDI doesn't create a debt burden for the recipient country.  It's a more stable form of capital inflow compared to portfolio investments or debt financing, which are more susceptible to sudden withdrawals during economic downturns.


**18. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor's appointment and powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI Governor is appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Union Finance Minister.
2.  The RBI Governor's powers are primarily derived from the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the appointment process involves consultation with the Finance Ministry, the RBI Governor is appointed by the President of India.  The President's role is constitutionally mandated, and the Finance Minister's role is advisory.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI Governor's authority and responsibilities are largely defined by the RBI Act, 1934.  This Act sets out the framework for the RBI's operations and the Governor's role in overseeing its functions.  While other laws and regulations may also influence the RBI's actions, the RBI Act is the foundational legal instrument governing the Governor's powers.


**19. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  UCBs are primarily supervised and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  UCBs are permitted to issue both equity shares and preference shares to raise capital.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While UCBs were initially under the purview of state governments, the RBI now plays a significant role in their supervision and regulation.  The RBI's oversight helps maintain the stability and soundness of the UCB sector and ensures adherence to banking regulations.

Statement 2 is correct.  UCBs are allowed to issue both equity shares and preference shares as a means of raising capital to support their operations and growth.  This is a common mechanism for banks to expand their capital base and meet regulatory requirements.


**20. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following statements:**

1.  Actions of the United States Federal Reserve (the Fed) have a significant impact on Indian Government Bond Yields.
2.  Inflation in India has minimal impact on government bond yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The actions of the Fed, particularly changes in US interest rates, significantly influence global capital flows.  These flows impact the demand for Indian government bonds, affecting their yields.  If US interest rates rise, investors may shift funds to US bonds, reducing demand for Indian bonds and potentially increasing their yields.  Global monetary policy has a ripple effect on emerging markets like India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Inflation has a substantial impact on government bond yields. Higher inflation erodes the purchasing power of future interest payments, leading investors to demand higher yields to compensate for the inflation risk.  Inflation is a key determinant of bond yields in any economy, including India.  Investors demand higher returns to offset the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation.


**21. With reference to instruments that can be included in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds can be considered a form of FDI.
2.  Non-resident external (NRE) deposits are a form of FDI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) can be considered a form of FDI if they are converted into equity shares.  While initially debt instruments, their conversion into equity represents a direct investment in the company.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NRE deposits are not considered FDI.  They represent deposits made by NRIs in Indian banks, and they are essentially a form of foreign portfolio investment rather than direct investment in a company or business. NRE deposits are short-term investment and not long term investment which is the characteristic of FDI.


**22. With reference to the effects of currency devaluation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Currency devaluation necessarily improves a country's trade balance.
2.  Currency devaluation necessarily increases the foreign value of the domestic currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While devaluation aims to make exports cheaper and imports more expensive, thereby potentially improving the trade balance, it does not guarantee it. The effectiveness of devaluation depends on several factors, including the elasticity of demand for exports and imports, the responses of other countries, and global market conditions.  Devaluation can sometimes lead to a worsening trade balance if import demand is inelastic.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Devaluation, by definition, reduces the value of a country's currency in relation to other currencies.  It does not increase the foreign value of the domestic currency; rather, it decreases it.  The purpose of devaluation is to make the domestic currency less valuable relative to foreign currencies.


**23. With reference to factors that can cause or increase demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Expansionary fiscal policies can contribute to demand-pull inflation.
2.  Rising interest rates are a significant cause of demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Expansionary fiscal policies, involving increased government spending or tax cuts, can boost aggregate demand. If this increased demand outpaces the economy's capacity to produce goods and services, it can lead to demand-pull inflation, where prices rise due to excessive demand.  This is a classic macroeconomic scenario.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rising interest rates are typically used to *combat* inflation, not cause it. Higher interest rates reduce borrowing and spending, thereby cooling down aggregate demand and reducing inflationary pressures.  Rising interest rates are a contractionary monetary policy tool used to curb inflation.


**24. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) actions in response to macroeconomic conditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  If inflation is too high, the RBI is likely to buy government securities to increase money supply.
2.  If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to sell dollars in the foreign exchange market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. If inflation is too high, the RBI would typically *sell* government securities (through open market operations) to reduce the money supply and curb inflation.  Buying securities would increase the money supply, exacerbating inflation.  This is a fundamental tool of monetary policy.

Statement 2 is correct. If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI would intervene in the foreign exchange market by selling dollars from its reserves to increase the supply of dollars and support the rupee's value. This is a standard method used by central banks to manage exchange rates and stabilize the currency.  Selling dollars increases the supply of dollars, reducing the pressure on the rupee.


**25. With reference to the advantages of Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  IIBs allow the government to reduce coupon rates on its borrowing.
2.  IIBs provide investors with protection against capital losses due to unexpected inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Because IIBs adjust the principal and interest payments based on inflation, the government can offer lower coupon rates than on conventional bonds without sacrificing the attractiveness of the investment to investors.  This reduces the government's borrowing costs.

Statement 2 is correct. IIBs offer investors protection against inflation risk.  The principal and interest payments are adjusted for inflation, preventing investors from experiencing capital losses due to unexpected increases in the price level.  This makes IIBs an attractive investment option, particularly in times of high or volatile inflation.  The inflation adjustment protects the real value of the investment.


**26. With reference to the effects of a tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, consider the following statements:**

1.  A tight monetary policy by the US Fed could lead to capital flight from emerging markets, including India.
2.  Capital flight increases the interest cost for firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A tight monetary policy by the US Fed, typically involving higher interest rates, makes US dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors globally. This can lead to capital flight from emerging markets like India as investors seek higher returns in US assets.  Higher interest rates in the US draw capital away from other countries.

Statement 2 is correct.  If capital flees from India, the supply of funds in the Indian market decreases, potentially leading to higher interest rates. This directly increases the cost of servicing existing ECBs for Indian firms, as they have to pay more to service their dollar-denominated debt.  Increased demand for funds leads to higher interest rates.


**27. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1.  Convertible bonds typically offer a lower interest rate compared to non-convertible bonds due to the option to convert to equity.
2.  The option to convert to equity in convertible bonds provides some degree of protection against inflation for the bondholder.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Because convertible bonds offer the option to convert into equity shares, they typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds.  The potential upside from equity participation compensates for the lower interest income.  Investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate due to the potential for equity appreciation.

Statement 2 is correct.  If the company issuing the convertible bond performs well, the value of the equity shares obtained through conversion could potentially increase faster than inflation, offering some protection against inflation for the bondholder.  The equity component provides a hedge against inflation.  However, it's important to note that this is not a guaranteed protection; the value of the equity could also decline.


**1. With reference to the features of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) Act, 2003, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates the central government to eliminate the revenue deficit by a specific date and subsequently build up an adequate revenue surplus.
2.  The Act permits exceeding fiscal deficit targets only under exceptional circumstances such as national security threats or natural calamities, with limitations on the extent of such deviations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FRBM Act, 2003, aimed to establish fiscal prudence and macroeconomic stability in India. Statement 1 accurately reflects a core objective of the Act: to reduce and eventually eliminate the revenue deficit, followed by the accumulation of a revenue surplus. This is crucial for long-term fiscal sustainability and reducing the government's reliance on borrowing.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Act includes an "escape clause" that allows for exceeding fiscal deficit targets under exceptional circumstances, such as national security threats or natural calamities. However, these deviations are subject to limitations and require justification.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements are accurate representations of the FRBM Act's provisions. Option (d) is incorrect because the Act incorporates both the elements mentioned in the statements.  Understanding the FRBM Act's provisions, including its targets and the escape clause, is crucial for comprehending India's fiscal policy framework and its implications for macroeconomic stability.


**2. With reference to the concept of "effective revenue deficit" and "effective capital expenditure", consider the following statements:**

1. Effective revenue deficit excludes grants given to states for the creation of capital assets, while effective capital expenditure includes such grants.
2. The calculation of effective revenue deficit and effective capital expenditure addresses the accounting complexities arising from central government grants that create assets owned by state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The concepts of "effective revenue deficit" and "effective capital expenditure" are crucial for a nuanced understanding of India's government budgeting. Statement 1 correctly points out the key difference in calculation: grants used for capital asset creation by states are excluded from the effective revenue deficit but included in the effective capital expenditure. This adjustment provides a more accurate picture of the government's true spending on consumption versus investment. Statement 2 accurately explains the rationale behind these adjusted figures;  the standard definitions of revenue and capital expenditure can be misleading when central grants lead to asset creation at the state level.  Therefore, these adjusted figures offer a more realistic assessment of the government's fiscal position.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, as both statements accurately describe aspects of these adjusted fiscal measures. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are factually correct and reflect the complexities in accounting for central government grants that result in capital asset creation at the state level.


**3. With reference to the different types of subsidies provided by the government, consider the following statements:**

1.  Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for farmers represent an example of a producer subsidy, while subsidies on LPG cylinders are examples of consumer subsidies.
2. Implicit subsidies, such as under-pricing of public goods and services, are less transparent and harder to quantify compared to explicit subsidies provided through direct cash transfers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Understanding the different types of subsidies is vital for analyzing government expenditure and its impact on the economy. Statement 1 correctly differentiates between producer and consumer subsidies. MSPs aim to support farmers' incomes (producer benefit), while LPG subsidies directly benefit consumers.  Statement 2 accurately highlights the distinction between explicit and implicit subsidies. Explicit subsidies are clearly defined and budgeted, like direct benefit transfers (DBT). Implicit subsidies are often hidden within the pricing of public goods and services, making them less transparent and difficult to track accurately.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements offer accurate descriptions of subsidy types and their characteristics. Option (d) is incorrect because the statements correctly classify the different types of subsidies and their relative transparency.


**4. With reference to the methods of disbursing subsidies, consider the following statements:**

1. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) aims to improve the efficiency of anti-poverty programmes by reducing leakages and administrative costs associated with traditional price subsidies.
2. Income support, unlike price subsidies and DBT, does not distort market mechanisms because it provides unconditional cash transfers without influencing the price or purchase of specific goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The shift towards DBT and income support represents a significant change in India's subsidy delivery mechanism. Statement 1 accurately describes the advantages of DBT. By directly transferring funds to beneficiaries' accounts, DBT reduces leakages, administrative overhead, and the inefficiencies inherent in distributing subsidized goods. Statement 2 accurately contrasts income support with other subsidy methods.  Income support provides unconditional cash transfers, allowing beneficiaries to spend the money as they see fit, without distorting market prices or creating artificial demand for specific goods. This avoids the market distortions associated with price subsidies. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements correctly identify key features and advantages of these subsidy mechanisms. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually accurate and highlight the distinct advantages and characteristics of these different subsidy delivery mechanisms.


**5. With reference to the government's fiscal deficit and its implications, consider the following statements:**

1. A large fiscal deficit necessarily leads to inflation, as increased government spending or tax cuts boost aggregate demand beyond the economy's productive capacity.
2. The concept of "crowding out" suggests that increased government borrowing to finance a fiscal deficit can reduce private investment by increasing competition for available savings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Understanding the relationship between fiscal deficits and macroeconomic outcomes is crucial for policy analysis.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While a large fiscal deficit can be inflationary, it's not an automatic consequence.  If the economy has significant idle capacity, increased government spending can boost output without causing inflation. The inflationary pressure arises when aggregate demand exceeds the economy's potential output. Statement 2 is correct. The "crowding out" effect describes how increased government borrowing can compete with private sector borrowing for limited savings, potentially raising interest rates and reducing private investment.  This is a key concern associated with large fiscal deficits.  Option (a) is incorrect because statement 1 is not always true. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is accurate and reflects a significant macroeconomic concern associated with large fiscal deficits.


**6. With reference to the concepts of revenue deficit and fiscal deficit, consider the following statements:**

1. Revenue deficit represents the excess of government revenue expenditure over revenue receipts, indicating dissaving by the government.
2. Fiscal deficit is the difference between total government expenditure and total receipts excluding borrowing, representing the government's total borrowing requirement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Revenue deficit and fiscal deficit are key indicators of a government's fiscal health. Statement 1 accurately defines revenue deficit.  When revenue expenditure (spending that doesn't create assets) exceeds revenue receipts, the government is consuming more than it earns, leading to dissaving. This necessitates borrowing to finance consumption, which is unsustainable in the long run. Statement 2 accurately defines fiscal deficit. It represents the total borrowing requirement of the government, calculated as the difference between total expenditure and total receipts (excluding borrowings).  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as both statements provide correct definitions of these crucial fiscal indicators. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are accurate and essential for understanding the government's fiscal position.


**7. With reference to the types of taxes levied in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Progressive taxes, where the tax rate increases with income, aim to achieve greater equity in the tax system.
2.  Ad valorem taxes, levied as a percentage of the value of goods or services, differ from specific taxes, which are fixed amounts per unit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian tax system employs various types of taxes with different objectives and characteristics. Statement 1 correctly describes progressive taxes.  These taxes are designed to ensure that higher earners contribute a larger proportion of their income in taxes, promoting a more equitable distribution of the tax burden.  Statement 2 correctly distinguishes between ad valorem and specific taxes. Ad valorem taxes are based on the value of the item, while specific taxes are a fixed amount per unit regardless of value. This difference impacts the incidence of the tax, particularly during periods of inflation. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect since both statements accurately describe different tax types and their characteristics. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements offer correct descriptions of the tax systems employed in India.


**8. With reference to the impact of government policies on the economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Expansionary fiscal policy, involving increased government spending and reduced taxes, aims to stimulate economic activity during recessions.
2.  Counter-cyclical fiscal policy seeks to stabilize the economy by implementing policies that counteract the prevailing economic trend (boom or recession).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Government fiscal policy plays a crucial role in managing the business cycle. Statement 1 accurately describes expansionary fiscal policy. By increasing government spending and reducing taxes, this policy injects more money into the economy, boosting aggregate demand and stimulating economic activity, particularly during recessions. Statement 2 accurately describes counter-cyclical fiscal policy. This policy aims to stabilize the economy by taking actions that counter the current economic trend. During booms, counter-cyclical policies might involve reducing spending or increasing taxes to cool down the economy. During recessions, the opposite approach would be taken. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements offer accurate descriptions of the government's fiscal policy tools and their objectives. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually correct and reflect the government's approach to managing the business cycle.


**9. With reference to the primary deficit and its calculation, consider the following statements:**

1. The primary deficit measures the government's deficit excluding interest payments on its accumulated debt, focusing on current fiscal imbalances.
2.  The primary deficit is calculated by subtracting net interest liabilities from the fiscal deficit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The primary deficit provides a more focused measure of the government's fiscal position. Statement 1 correctly defines the primary deficit. By excluding interest payments, it isolates the government's current spending and revenue imbalances, providing a clearer picture of the government's ability to manage its finances without the burden of past debt. Statement 2 correctly describes the calculation of the primary deficit. Subtracting net interest liabilities (interest payments minus interest receipts) from the fiscal deficit removes the impact of past debt, resulting in a measure that reflects the government's current fiscal performance. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as both statements accurately explain the concept and calculation of the primary deficit. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually correct and essential for understanding the calculation and significance of the primary deficit.


**10. With reference to the concept of public goods, consider the following statements:**

1. Public goods are characterized by non-rivalry, meaning one person's consumption doesn't diminish another's, and non-excludability, meaning it's difficult to prevent anyone from consuming them.
2.  The non-rivalrous and non-excludable nature of public goods makes it difficult for private entities to provide them profitably, necessitating government provision.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Public goods are a distinct category of goods with unique characteristics. Statement 1 correctly defines the key characteristics of public goods. Non-rivalry means that multiple individuals can consume the good simultaneously without diminishing its availability for others.  Non-excludability means that it is difficult or impossible to prevent individuals from consuming the good, even if they don't pay for it. Statement 2 correctly explains why the government is typically responsible for providing public goods. Because private entities cannot easily charge for their use due to non-excludability, and because the additional cost of providing the good to one more person is zero due to non-rivalry, they lack the incentive to provide them at an efficient level. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately describe the nature of public goods and the reasons for government intervention in their provision. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually correct and reflect the core characteristics of public goods and the rationale for government intervention.



**1. With reference to the concept of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services across different countries, adjusting for differences in price levels.
2.  According to PPP, a country with a lower price level will have a higher exchange rate relative to a country with a higher price level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It aims to determine the relative value of currencies by comparing the prices of the same goods and services in different countries.  The calculations adjust for price level differences to provide a more accurate comparison of purchasing power than nominal exchange rates alone.

Statement 2 is also correct.  PPP theory suggests that exchange rates should adjust to equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. If a country has a lower price level for a given basket of goods, its currency should be relatively stronger (have a higher exchange rate) compared to a country with a higher price level. This ensures that the same amount of money buys a similar amount of goods and services in both countries, when converted using the PPP exchange rate.  This is because the exchange rate adjusts to reflect the difference in price levels.


**2. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) signifies a weakening of the Indian Rupee against a basket of major currencies.
2. A decrease in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in India's international trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A rise in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates an appreciation (strengthening) of the domestic currency (in this case, the Indian Rupee) relative to a basket of other currencies.  A higher NEER means it takes more units of foreign currencies to buy one unit of the Rupee.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) adjusts the NEER for inflation differentials between countries. A decrease in REER suggests that Indian goods and services are becoming relatively cheaper compared to those of other nations. This increased price competitiveness boosts exports and improves the country's trade balance, thus enhancing international trade competitiveness.


**3. With reference to Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The weight assigned to food items is significantly higher in the CPI compared to the WPI, reflecting the greater importance of food in household consumption.
2. The WPI, unlike the CPI, does not capture changes in service sector prices, which have become a significant component of the Indian economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CPI (Consumer Price Index) tracks the average change in prices paid by urban and rural consumers for a basket of goods and services.  Food items constitute a substantial portion of household budgets in India, particularly for lower-income groups. Therefore, the CPI assigns a higher weight to food items compared to the WPI, which reflects the broader economy's price changes.

Statement 2 is also correct. The WPI (Wholesale Price Index) primarily measures price changes at the wholesale level for goods.  It traditionally excluded services; however, in recent years, there have been attempts to incorporate service sector prices into the WPI calculation.  Nevertheless, the CPI remains a more comprehensive measure of inflation for the overall consumer economy, especially considering the growing importance of the service sector in India's GDP.


**4. With reference to the determinants of economic development, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sustained increases in real GNP per capita are sufficient to ensure a higher level of economic development, even if poverty and unemployment remain high.
2.  A high saving rate in an economy guarantees significant increases in output, provided the capital-output ratio remains low.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While increases in real GNP per capita are an indicator of economic growth, they do not fully encapsulate economic development. Economic development is a broader concept that encompasses improvements in various social indicators like poverty reduction, unemployment levels, education, health, infrastructure, and overall quality of life.  High GNP per capita with persistent poverty and unemployment signifies unequal distribution of wealth and doesn't reflect genuine development.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. A high saving rate is a necessary condition for investment and potential economic growth, but it's not sufficient. The capital-output ratio (the amount of capital required to produce one unit of output) plays a crucial role. A high capital-output ratio implies that a large amount of investment is needed to generate a relatively small increase in output, thus negating the effect of high savings. Other factors like technological advancements, efficient resource allocation, and institutional frameworks also influence the impact of savings on output.


**5. With reference to the Indian Government's fiscal policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Reducing revenue expenditure is an effective measure to reduce the fiscal deficit, but it may negatively impact essential public services.
2.  Introducing new welfare schemes, while potentially increasing social benefits, can exacerbate the fiscal deficit if not adequately funded.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Revenue expenditure constitutes the government's day-to-day expenses on items like salaries, subsidies, and interest payments.  Reducing this expenditure can directly lower the fiscal deficit. However, indiscriminate cuts can negatively impact the provision of essential public services like education, healthcare, and infrastructure, potentially hindering long-term economic growth and social welfare. A balanced approach is necessary.

Statement 2 is also correct. New welfare schemes often involve substantial expenditure, potentially widening the fiscal deficit if not accompanied by corresponding increases in government revenue or cuts in other areas. While these schemes aim to improve social welfare, their fiscal implications must be carefully considered to ensure fiscal sustainability.  The government needs to prioritize and strategically implement such schemes to minimize the adverse impact on the fiscal deficit.


**6. With reference to the Indian banking system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) are regulatory requirements imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on commercial banks to maintain a certain proportion of their deposits in liquid assets.
2.  High CRR and SLR requirements can reduce the profitability of commercial banks by limiting their lending capacity and earning potential from investments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CRR (Cash Reserve Ratio) mandates that commercial banks maintain a specified percentage of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as cash reserves with the RBI.  The SLR (Statutory Liquidity Ratio) requires banks to hold a certain proportion of their NDTL in the form of liquid assets like government securities. These are regulatory tools used by the RBI to control money supply and maintain financial stability.

Statement 2 is also correct. High CRR and SLR requirements directly impact the profitability of banks.  A larger portion of their deposits is held as reserves, reducing the amount available for lending to customers or investing in other profitable ventures.  Lower lending and investment opportunities translate to reduced interest income, thereby affecting the banks' overall profitability.  The RBI needs to carefully balance the need for financial stability with the requirement of ensuring adequate profitability for banks.


**7. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI involves long-term capital investments in a company or business, often accompanied by managerial and technological inputs.
2. FII primarily involves investment in the secondary market of stocks and bonds, with a shorter-term investment horizon compared to FDI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) represents a significant commitment of capital by a foreign entity into a domestic company or project.  It is typically a long-term investment strategy, frequently involving active management participation and transfer of technology or expertise. This makes FDI a crucial source of capital, technology, and managerial skills for recipient economies.

Statement 2 is also correct. Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) involves investments by foreign institutional investors (like mutual funds, pension funds, etc.) in a country’s financial markets.  These investments are primarily in the secondary market (buying and selling of existing stocks and bonds) and are generally characterized by a shorter-term investment horizon compared to FDI.  FIIs play a significant role in providing liquidity to the markets but are also known for their volatility.


**8. With reference to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The FRBM Act mandates the central government to progressively reduce its fiscal deficit and achieve a revenue surplus.
2. The Act requires the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to subscribe to the primary issues of central government securities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) Act of 2003 aims to improve the management of India's public finances.  A core objective is to gradually reduce the fiscal deficit (the difference between government expenditure and revenue) and eventually achieve a revenue surplus (where revenue exceeds expenditure). This promotes fiscal prudence and long-term macroeconomic stability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FRBM Act, in fact, aims to reduce the government's reliance on borrowing from the RBI. The Act explicitly restricts the RBI from subscribing to primary issues of central government securities, thereby promoting market-based borrowing and reducing the government's dependence on the central bank for financing its deficits. This measure is intended to enhance the independence of monetary policy.


**9. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. IIBs offer investors protection against inflation risk by adjusting the principal and/or interest payments based on inflation.
2. IIBs help the government reduce its borrowing costs by offering lower coupon rates compared to conventional bonds.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. The principal and interest payments on IIBs are adjusted periodically based on changes in a pre-determined inflation index. This ensures that the real return on the investment remains relatively stable, even if inflation rises.

Statement 2 is also correct. Because IIBs offer inflation protection, the government can afford to issue them with lower coupon rates (interest payments) compared to conventional bonds. Investors are willing to accept a lower nominal interest rate because the real return is protected from inflation. This helps reduce the government's borrowing costs.


**10. With reference to the impact of a tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, consider the following statements:**

1. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve may lead to capital flight from emerging markets, including India.
2. Capital flight may increase the interest cost for Indian firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) as the demand for dollars increases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A tight monetary policy (like increasing interest rates) in the US attracts foreign investment into dollar-denominated assets. This increases the demand for dollars, appreciating the dollar and making other currencies (including the Indian Rupee) relatively less attractive.  This can cause capital flight from emerging markets like India as investors move their funds to the US to take advantage of higher returns.

Statement 2 is also correct.  If capital flows out of India (capital flight), the demand for dollars in the Indian foreign exchange market will increase.  This strengthens the dollar and makes it more expensive for Indian firms to repay their dollar-denominated debts (ECBs).  The increased demand for dollars will also generally increase the cost of borrowing in dollars for Indian firms, even for new borrowings.


**11. With reference to the characteristics of Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Convertible bonds typically offer a lower interest rate compared to non-convertible bonds because of the embedded option to convert them into equity.
2. The conversion option in convertible bonds provides some degree of protection to bondholders against inflation risk, as equity values often rise with inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Convertible bonds offer the holder the right to convert the bond into a specified number of shares of the issuing company's stock at a predetermined price. This option adds value to the bond, enabling companies to offer a lower interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds. Investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate because of the potential upside from equity participation.

Statement 2 is also correct. While not a perfect hedge, the conversion feature of convertible bonds offers some protection against inflation.  As inflation rises, the value of the underlying equity often increases, potentially offsetting some of the loss in purchasing power.  This makes convertible bonds relatively attractive in inflationary environments compared to fixed-income securities with no such option.  However, it is important to note that equity prices are not perfectly correlated with inflation, and this protection isn't guaranteed.


**12. With reference to the "Amrit Kaal" vision for India, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Panch Pran" (five pledges) of Amrit Kaal include the commitment to achieving a developed India by 2047.
2. The "Amrit Kaal" vision encompasses a 25-year roadmap focusing on economic growth and technological advancement, with minimal emphasis on social justice and inclusivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The "Amrit Kaal," marking India's 75th year of independence, is a 25-year period leading up to the centenary of independence in 2047.  The "Panch Pran" (five pledges) outlined by the Prime Minister aim to guide India's development during this period.  A key pledge is to make India a developed nation by 2047.  This involves various aspects of development, including economic growth, social progress, and technological advancement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the "Amrit Kaal" vision prioritizes economic growth and technological advancement, it explicitly emphasizes social justice and inclusivity.  The "Panch Pran" pledges include commitments to eliminating all vestiges of colonial mentality, upholding India's rich heritage, fostering unity and solidarity, and emphasizing the duties of citizens.  These aspects underscore the importance of social cohesion and inclusive growth alongside economic development.


**13. With reference to inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth in India aims to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are equitably shared among all sections of society, irrespective of their socioeconomic background or identity.
2.  Strategies for achieving inclusive growth in India primarily focus on income redistribution through direct cash transfers, rather than on creating productive employment opportunities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Inclusive growth is a development strategy that seeks to ensure that the benefits of economic growth reach all segments of the population.  In the Indian context, it emphasizes addressing inequalities based on factors like class, caste, gender, religion, and region.  The goal is to create a more equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to participate in and benefit from economic progress.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While income redistribution can be a supplementary measure, inclusive growth strategies in India primarily focus on creating productive employment opportunities and improving access to essential resources like education, healthcare, and infrastructure.  The emphasis is on empowering marginalized groups through skill development, entrepreneurship, and access to markets, rather than solely relying on direct cash transfers for poverty alleviation.  Productive employment is viewed as a more sustainable and empowering approach to inclusive growth.


**14. With reference to the concept of "fiscal stimulus", consider the following statements:**

1. A fiscal stimulus involves government intervention to boost economic activity by increasing government spending or reducing taxes.
2. A fiscal stimulus primarily focuses on providing direct financial assistance to individual citizens to stimulate consumption demand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A fiscal stimulus is a macroeconomic policy tool used to counteract economic downturns. Governments employ it by increasing government spending (on infrastructure projects, social programs, etc.) or by cutting taxes to stimulate aggregate demand.  Increased government spending directly boosts demand, while tax cuts increase disposable income, leading to higher consumer spending and investment.  The aim is to stimulate economic activity and create jobs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a fiscal stimulus might indirectly lead to increased consumption, its primary focus is not on providing direct financial assistance to individuals.  The stimulus aims to influence aggregate demand through broader measures like government spending and tax policies, rather than targeted handouts.  Direct cash transfers can be a part of a broader fiscal stimulus package, but they are not the defining characteristic.


**15. With reference to Value Added Tax (VAT), consider the following statements:**

1. VAT is a multi-stage tax levied at each stage of the production and distribution chain, based on the value added at each stage.
2. VAT is a tax on the final consumption of goods and services, with the ultimate burden borne by the consumer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Value Added Tax (VAT) is a consumption tax applied at each stage of the production and distribution process.  It is levied on the value added at each stage, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost of inputs purchased from previous stages.  This prevents double taxation, as only the value added at each stage is taxed.

Statement 2 is also correct. While VAT is collected at multiple stages, it is ultimately a tax on the final consumption of goods and services.  Businesses can claim credits for the VAT they've already paid on inputs, so the final price paid by the consumer incorporates the VAT only once.  Therefore, the consumer bears the final burden of the VAT.


**16. With reference to the sources of revenue for the Union Government in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All revenues received by the Union Government are credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  The Contingency Fund of India is used to meet unexpected expenses not provided for in the budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Consolidated Fund of India is the main repository of all revenues received by the Union Government.  This includes tax revenues, non-tax revenues, grants received from foreign governments, and other receipts.  All government expenditure (except for those from the Contingency Fund and Public Account) must be authorized by Parliament and met from this fund.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Contingency Fund of India is a reserve fund established under the Constitution to meet unforeseen emergencies.  It is meant to provide funds for expenses that cannot be anticipated during the budget-making process.  Withdrawals from this fund require the President's authorization and are subsequently reported to Parliament.


**17. With reference to the Indian Government's budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The authorization for withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India rests solely with the Parliament.
2. The annual Union Budget must be passed by both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha before funds can be withdrawn.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Constitution of India vests the power to authorize the withdrawal of funds from the Consolidated Fund of India with the Parliament.  No expenditure can be incurred by the government without prior parliamentary approval.  This is a crucial safeguard to ensure transparency and accountability in public finance management.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Union Budget needs to be presented in both Houses of Parliament, it is the Lok Sabha (the Lower House) that has the primary power to pass the budget.  The Rajya Sabha (Upper House) can only delay the budget for a maximum of 14 days; it cannot reject the budget.  Once the Lok Sabha passes the budget, the government can begin withdrawing funds from the Consolidated Fund of India.


**18. With reference to capital gains, consider the following statements:**

1.  Capital gains arise only when there is an increase in the market value of an asset.
2. Capital gains tax is levied on the profit earned from the sale of capital assets, like stocks, real estate or art.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Capital gains refer to the profit realized from the sale of a capital asset.  Capital assets are typically long-term investments, like stocks, bonds, real estate, or precious metals.  Capital gains only arise when the selling price of the asset exceeds its original purchase price or its adjusted cost basis (accounting for depreciation, etc.).  A mere increase in market value without a sale doesn't generate a realized capital gain.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Capital gains tax is a tax levied on the profit earned from the sale or exchange of capital assets.  The tax rate varies depending on the type of asset, holding period, and the applicable tax laws of the relevant jurisdiction.  This tax is a significant source of revenue for many governments worldwide.


**19.  With reference to the functions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI acts as a banker to the government, managing government accounts and providing financial services.
2. The RBI's primary function is to regulate and supervise the commercial banks in India to ensure the stability of the banking system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI acts as a banker to both the central and state governments. It manages their accounts, provides advice on financial matters, and facilitates government borrowing through the issuance of government securities. This is a crucial role in managing public finances.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Maintaining the stability of the banking system is a primary mandate of the RBI. It regulates and supervises commercial banks, setting rules for capital adequacy, lending practices, and risk management.  It also acts as the lender of last resort to banks in times of financial distress, preventing systemic failures.  The RBI's supervisory role is critical to maintaining public confidence in the banking system.


**20. With reference to measures that increase the money supply in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The purchase of government securities in the open market by the central bank increases the money supply.
2.  A decrease in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) increases the money supply by freeing up funds for banks to lend.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. When the central bank buys government securities from commercial banks or the public, it injects money into the economy.  The banks or individuals selling the securities receive cash, which increases their deposit balances.  This increase in reserves allows banks to lend out more money, leading to a multiple expansion of the money supply through the money multiplier effect.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The CRR (Cash Reserve Ratio) is the percentage of deposits that commercial banks are required to hold with the central bank.  Reducing the CRR allows banks to retain a larger portion of their deposits as available reserves. This enables them to lend more money, thereby increasing the money supply.  A lower CRR is an expansionary monetary policy tool.


**21. With reference to the components of the Indian Government's budget, consider the following statements:**

1.  Expenditure on the acquisition of assets like roads, buildings, and machinery is classified as capital expenditure.
2.  Loans received from foreign governments are included in the revenue budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Capital expenditure refers to government spending on creating assets that will benefit future generations.  This includes investments in infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc.), buildings, machinery, and other durable assets.  These investments enhance the country's productive capacity and contribute to long-term economic growth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Loans received from foreign governments are considered capital receipts.  They are not part of the revenue budget, which comprises tax revenues and non-tax revenues received during the fiscal year.  Capital receipts are non-recurring, while revenue receipts are recurring.  Loans received are used to finance capital expenditure and are recorded separately in the capital budget.


**22.  With reference to the likely advantages of implementing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. GST simplifies the tax structure by subsuming multiple indirect taxes into a single tax, leading to better tax compliance and revenue collection.
2.  GST leads to a significant reduction in the Current Account Deficit (CAD) by boosting exports and reducing imports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The GST (Goods and Services Tax) was implemented in India to create a unified indirect tax system.  It replaced several indirect taxes levied by the central and state governments, creating a single, national market.  This simplification reduces compliance costs for businesses and makes tax evasion more difficult, improving tax collection efficiency and broadening the tax base.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While GST can positively impact trade by reducing tax-related barriers, its direct effect on the Current Account Deficit (CAD) is not necessarily significant or guaranteed.  The CAD depends on various factors, including the balance of trade, investment flows, and remittances.  While GST can contribute to improved competitiveness and potentially higher exports, it does not directly and significantly control the CAD.


**23. With reference to the relationship between tax revenue, GDP, and fiscal deficit in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A steady increase in tax revenue as a percentage of GDP indicates improved tax collection efficiency and a stronger fiscal position.
2. A consistently high fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP is always indicative of unsustainable government finances and potential economic instability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Tax revenue as a percentage of GDP is a key indicator of a government's fiscal strength.  A rising ratio generally indicates improved tax collection efficiency, a broader tax base, or increased economic activity.  This strengthens the government's ability to finance its expenditure and reduce reliance on borrowing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a consistently high fiscal deficit is a cause for concern, it does not always imply unsustainable government finances or inevitable economic instability.  The impact of a fiscal deficit depends on various factors, including the composition of the deficit (revenue vs. capital), the level of public debt, the growth rate of the economy, and the overall macroeconomic environment.  A high fiscal deficit during an economic downturn may be a necessary measure for stimulus.  Context and other economic indicators are crucial for proper analysis.


**24. With reference to the recommendations of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Review Committee, consider the following statements:**

1. The FRBM Review Committee recommended a gradual reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio for the combined central and state governments.
2. The Committee emphasized the need for greater fiscal transparency and accountability in government finances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) Review Committee, tasked with reviewing India's fiscal framework, recommended a path towards reducing the overall debt-to-GDP ratio for both the central and state governments. This is aimed at improving fiscal sustainability and reducing the country's vulnerability to economic shocks.  The committee suggested a phased approach to achieve the target ratio.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The committee strongly advocated for greater fiscal transparency and accountability.  This involves measures like improved budget preparation, clearer presentation of fiscal data, enhanced public disclosure of government finances, and strengthening mechanisms for parliamentary oversight of public expenditure.  Greater transparency is vital for building public trust and ensuring responsible fiscal management.


**25. With reference to the impact of black money on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. Black money contributes to the growth of the informal economy by evading taxes and regulations.
2. The primary concern for the government regarding black money is its impact on social welfare programs due to reduced government revenue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Black money, or unaccounted-for income, fuels the growth of the informal economy.  Businesses operating in the informal sector often evade taxes and regulations, leading to reduced government revenue and a distortion of the market.  Black money is also often used in transactions that are not subject to normal banking processes.

Statement 2 is also correct. While black money has several negative consequences, the primary concern for the government is the loss of revenue to the state exchequer due to tax evasion.  This loss of revenue directly affects the government's ability to fund public services and social welfare programs, limiting the resources available for essential social initiatives.  This undermines the government's ability to address critical social issues and promote equitable development.


**26. With reference to capital and revenue expenditure, consider the following statements:**

1.  Acquiring new technology for a business is considered capital expenditure because it enhances the company's long-term productive capacity.
2. Debt financing is classified as capital expenditure, while equity financing is considered revenue expenditure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Capital expenditure (CAPEX) involves investments in fixed assets that will generate benefits over several years.  Acquiring new technology is a classic example of CAPEX as it improves a company's productive capabilities and competitiveness in the long run.  The cost of the technology is spread over its useful life through depreciation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The classification of debt and equity financing depends on how the funds are used, not the source of the funds. Both debt and equity financing can be used for both capital and revenue expenditure.  If the funds are used to acquire fixed assets or enhance long-term productive capacity, it is considered capital expenditure.  If the funds are used for day-to-day operations or expenses that don't create long-term assets, it is considered revenue expenditure.


**27. With reference to the sources of India's internal debt, consider the following statements:**

1. A significant portion of India's internal debt comes from borrowings from domestic households and financial institutions.
2. Dated securities issued at market-related rates in auctions constitute a major component of India's internal debt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A substantial part of India's internal debt arises from borrowings from domestic sources. This includes borrowings from households (through various savings schemes), financial institutions (banks, insurance companies, etc.), and other domestic investors.  This represents the government's reliance on domestic savings to finance its expenditure.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The government frequently raises funds by issuing dated securities (government bonds) through auctions. These securities offer a fixed rate of return over a specified period.  Auction-based issuance ensures market-determined interest rates, allowing the government to borrow at competitive rates.  Dated securities constitute a large portion of India's internal debt.


**1. With reference to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) Act, 2003, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates the central government to achieve a fiscal deficit of not more than 3% of GDP by March 31, 2021, and a revenue deficit of 0% by the same date.
2.  The Act permits deviations from the fiscal deficit target only on grounds explicitly specified, such as national security or natural calamity, with any such deviation subject to parliamentary approval.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The FRBM Act, 2003, aimed to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP by March 31, 2021, and the revenue deficit to 0% by the same date.  However, the actual achievement of these targets was subject to various factors and economic realities. The statement presents it as a rigid mandate, which is not entirely accurate. The act aimed for these targets but didn't guarantee their attainment.  The timeframe mentioned is also crucial, as subsequent amendments and economic circumstances may have altered the practical application of these initial targets.

Statement 2 is correct. The FRBM Act does allow for deviations from the fiscal deficit target under specific, exceptional circumstances like national security threats or major natural calamities.  These deviations, however, require justification and are not arbitrary. The Act emphasizes transparency and accountability, necessitating parliamentary approval for any such deviation.  This safeguard prevents misuse of the escape clause and ensures that the government remains answerable to the legislature for any fiscal adjustments outside the established norms. The process ensures that deviations aren't used as a loophole to circumvent fiscal discipline.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding government deficits in India:**

1. The revenue deficit represents the excess of government revenue expenditure over revenue receipts, indicating the government's reliance on borrowing to finance its consumption expenditure.
2. The primary deficit measures the government's borrowing requirement excluding interest payments on accumulated debt, providing a clearer picture of current fiscal imbalances.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A revenue deficit arises when a government's revenue expenditure (spending on day-to-day operations, salaries, subsidies etc.) exceeds its revenue receipts (tax revenue, non-tax revenue etc.). This signifies that the government is using up savings from other sectors of the economy to fund its consumption needs, leading to a build-up of debt. This is a cause for concern as it indicates a lack of fiscal sustainability.

Statement 2 is also correct. The primary deficit isolates the impact of current government spending on borrowing needs. By subtracting net interest payments (interest paid minus interest received) from the fiscal deficit, it provides a measure of the government's borrowing requirement solely attributable to its current expenditure exceeding current revenue.  This metric is useful in assessing the government's ability to manage its finances without relying on borrowing solely to service its existing debt.  A high primary deficit suggests unsustainable fiscal practices even when accounting for interest payments.


**3. With reference to the Indian government's budget, consider the following statements:**

1. The Consolidated Fund of India holds all revenues received by the government, including tax revenues, and all loans raised by the government.  Expenditures from this fund require parliamentary authorization.
2. The Public Account of India encompasses all public money received by the government except that credited to the Consolidated Fund of India; disbursements from this account do not require parliamentary authorization.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI). The CFI is the primary account for the government's receipts and expenditures.  All government revenues, whether from taxes or other sources, and all loans raised are credited to the CFI.  Importantly, no money can be withdrawn from the CFI without explicit parliamentary authorization, ensuring transparency and accountability in government spending.  This underlines the principle of parliamentary sovereignty over public funds.

Statement 2 correctly explains the Public Account of India. The Public Account holds public money received by the government that does not fall under the purview of the CFI. This includes funds held in trust, such as small savings schemes, provident funds, and deposits.  Unlike the CFI, disbursements from the Public Account do not require parliamentary approval. This is because the government acts as a trustee or banker in managing these funds, with the obligation to return them as per the terms under which they were received.  Parliamentary authorization is not needed for routine transactional activities.


**4. With reference to the measures of government deficit, consider the following statements:**

1.  The fiscal deficit is the difference between total government expenditure and total receipts excluding borrowings, representing the government's total borrowing requirement.
2. The effective revenue deficit is calculated by subtracting grants given to states for capital asset creation from the revenue deficit, providing a more accurate picture of the government's consumption spending.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The fiscal deficit is a key indicator of the government's financial health. It is calculated as the difference between the total expenditure (revenue and capital) and total receipts (revenue and capital) excluding borrowings.  Since borrowings are used to finance the deficit, the fiscal deficit directly indicates the government's total borrowing needs from all sources – domestic and external.  A high fiscal deficit raises concerns about debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The standard definition of revenue expenditure excludes spending that creates assets. However, some central government grants to states may be used to create capital assets within the states. To provide a more accurate reflection of the government's consumption spending (which doesn't lead to asset creation for the central government), the concept of the ‘effective revenue deficit’ is used. This metric adjusts the revenue deficit by subtracting grants used for capital asset creation in states, giving a more precise picture of the government's consumption-related borrowing needs.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Indian budget process:**

1. A "vote-on-account" is a mechanism used by the government to obtain parliamentary approval for expenditure for a limited period when the annual budget has not been passed. It deals only with expenditure.
2.  "Supplementary Demands for Grants" are presented to Parliament after the financial year has ended to cover any excess expenditure incurred during that year.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A "vote-on-account" is a constitutional provision that allows the government to obtain parliamentary approval for spending for a short period (usually two months) when the annual budget has not yet been approved. This prevents a shutdown of government operations while the budget process is ongoing.  Crucially, a vote-on-account only covers expenditure; it does not deal with revenue aspects of the budget.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  "Supplementary Demands for Grants" are presented to Parliament *before* the end of the financial year to seek additional funds for unforeseen expenses or to cover shortfalls in the original budget allocation for a particular service. "Demands for Excess Grants," on the other hand, are presented *after* the financial year has ended to cover any excess expenditure incurred during that year.  The statement confuses these two distinct procedures.


**6. With reference to the XV Finance Commission's recommendations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission recommended a vertical devolution of 41% of the divisible pool of central taxes to the states, distributed based on parameters such as population and income distance.
2.  The Commission's grants-in-aid included revenue deficit grants to states with fiscal capacity deficiencies and sector-specific grants for areas like health and education.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The XV Finance Commission's recommendations included a vertical devolution of 41% of the divisible pool of central taxes to states.  This devolution is a crucial element of fiscal federalism in India, aiming to address the vertical imbalance between the Centre and states. The distribution among states is based on multiple factors, including population, income distance, demographic performance, state area, forest cover, and tax effort, reflecting a multi-faceted approach to resource allocation.

Statement 2 is also correct. The XV Finance Commission's grants-in-aid encompassed various categories, including revenue deficit grants aimed at assisting states with revenue shortfalls and addressing fiscal capacity imbalances.  The commission also recommended sector-specific grants for key development areas such as health and education.  These grants often come with performance-based incentives, promoting better governance and service delivery.  This demonstrates a focus on both fiscal equalization and performance-based incentives to improve outcomes.


**7. With reference to the types of taxes in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A progressive tax system is one where the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases, while a regressive tax system has the tax rate decrease as the taxable amount increases.
2.  Specific taxes are levied as a fixed amount per unit of a good or service, while ad valorem taxes are levied as a percentage of the value of the good or service.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines progressive and regressive tax systems.  A progressive tax system, like the income tax in many countries, ensures that higher earners pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes.  This aims to redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality. Conversely, a regressive tax system, where the tax rate decreases as the taxable amount increases, disproportionately affects lower-income individuals.  Sales tax is often cited as an example of a regressive tax because it takes a larger percentage of income from low-income individuals.

Statement 2 correctly distinguishes between specific and ad valorem taxes. Specific taxes are levied at a fixed rate per unit of a good or service, regardless of its value. For example, a tax of Rs. 10 per liter of petrol is a specific tax. Ad valorem taxes, in contrast, are levied as a percentage of the value of the good or service.  Sales tax and GST are examples of ad valorem taxes, where the tax amount varies depending on the price of the goods or services.  This distinction is important for understanding the impact of taxes on different goods and services.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The RBI's role as a banker's bank involves maintaining commercial banks' deposits and providing them with liquidity support when needed.
2. The RBI's open market operations (OMO) are primarily used to support government borrowing rather than managing liquidity and inflation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes a key function of the RBI as a banker's bank.  Commercial banks maintain a portion of their reserves with the RBI, ensuring the stability of the banking system. In times of financial stress, the RBI acts as the lender of last resort, providing liquidity support to banks to prevent bank runs and maintain financial stability.  This is a crucial aspect of monetary policy and financial regulation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the RBI's open market operations (OMO) can influence government borrowing indirectly, their primary purpose is to manage liquidity in the economy and control inflation. The RBI buys and sells government securities in the open market to adjust the money supply. This is a key tool for implementing monetary policy objectives, aiming to balance economic growth, inflation control, and financial stability.  The statement misrepresents the primary focus of OMOs, which are primarily a monetary policy tool.  Supporting government borrowing is a secondary and indirect consequence.


**1. With reference to the distribution of tax revenue between the Centre and States, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Divisible Pool" of central taxes, from which states receive their share, includes cess and surcharge levied by the Union government.
2.  The horizontal devolution of tax proceeds among states considers parameters like income distance, population, and state area, but excludes demographic performance and forest and ecology factors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The divisible pool of central taxes explicitly excludes cess and surcharge. These are not shared with the states.  The cost of tax collection, tax revenue of Union Territories, and National Calamity Contingency Duty are also excluded.  The 41% share of divisible pool is distributed among the states as untied grants.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The horizontal devolution of tax proceeds among states, as recommended by the XV Finance Commission, *does* include demographic performance, state area, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal effort as parameters, in addition to income distance and population. These parameters are weighted differently to achieve a more equitable distribution.


**2. With reference to Grants-in-Aid to states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Revenue Deficit Grants, recommended by the Finance Commission, are always provided to states with a revenue deficit, regardless of their fiscal capacity or expenditure efforts.
2. Local Body Grants are distributed among states with a 90% weightage on population and a 10% weightage on area, ensuring equitable allocation across rural and urban local bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission does recommend Revenue Deficit Grants to states facing revenue deficits, these grants are not automatically provided.  The commission ensures that the grants correct deficiencies in fiscal capacity but do not encourage inadequate revenue effort or excessive expenditure. The number of states receiving these grants can vary over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the weightage for inter-se distribution of Local Body Grants among states is indeed 90% on population and 10% on area, the statement misrepresents the allocation across rural and urban local bodies. The ratio of grants for rural and urban local bodies gradually changes from 67.5:32.5 to 65:35, reflecting urbanization trends.


**3. With reference to the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The proceeds from the vertical devolution of central taxes are credited to the Consolidated Fund of India before being distributed to the states.
2. Grants-in-Aid to states under Article 275 are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, meaning they are automatically allocated without requiring parliamentary approval.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The vertical devolution of central taxes, representing the percentage share allocated to states, is *not* credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.  It is directly transferred to the states as untied grants. The Consolidated Fund is used for the government's general revenue and expenditure.

Statement 2 is correct. Grants-in-Aid provided under Article 275 of the Constitution are indeed charged on the Consolidated Fund of India. This means that their allocation is automatic and does not require separate parliamentary approval.  This is a key difference between these grants and other budgetary allocations.


**4. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on the President of India regarding all financial matters, including the Union Budget.
2. The Finance Commission's mandate includes advising on measures to augment the consolidated fund of a state to supplement the resources of Panchayats and Municipalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission makes recommendations on the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States, these recommendations are not binding on the President regarding *all* financial matters, including the Union Budget. The President's role is primarily related to approving the budget.

Statement 2 is correct. The Finance Commission's terms of reference explicitly include advising on measures to augment the consolidated fund of a state to supplement the resources of Panchayats and Municipalities. This is based on the recommendations made by the State Finance Commissions. This demonstrates the Commission's crucial role in intergovernmental fiscal relations.


**5. With reference to the Modernisation Fund for Defence and Internal Security, consider the following statements:**

1. The fund is solely financed through transfers from the Consolidated Fund of India.
2. The fund's proceeds can be used for capital investment in CAPFs and modernisation of state police forces, but not for welfare of soldiers and paramilitary personnel.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Modernisation Fund for Defence and Internal Security is not funded solely through transfers from the Consolidated Fund of India. It has multiple sources of funding, including disinvestment proceeds of DPSEs, proceeds from the monetisation of surplus defence land, and proceeds from receipts from defence land transfers.  This diversification of funding sources makes the fund more resilient.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The fund's proceeds can be used for capital investment in CAPFs and modernisation of state police forces, and also includes a component for welfare of soldiers and paramilitary personnel. This aspect reflects the holistic nature of the fund's objectives.


**6. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs are implemented by the Central Government and 100% funded by the Centre, primarily on subjects within the Union List.
2. Post 2014-15, all funds for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Funds of the States, unlike the earlier practice of direct transfers to state/district-level agencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are *not* solely implemented by the Central Government and 100% funded by the Centre.  They are implemented by State Governments, with funding shared between the Centre and States in varying ratios (e.g., 50:50, 70:30, etc.).  The subjects under CSSs are often from the State List, reflecting cooperative federalism.

Statement 2 is correct.  Prior to 2014-15, funds for CSSs were routed through two channels: the Consolidated Fund of States and direct transfers to state/district-level agencies.  However, from 2014-15 onwards, the government discontinued direct transfers, channeling all CSS funds through the Consolidated Funds of the States. This change streamlined the funding process.


**7. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), consider the following statements:**

1.  If a business sells a product within the same state, only the State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) is levied.
2.  Exports are considered "zero-rated" supplies under GST, meaning that the GST paid in the entire value chain is not refunded to the exporters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. If a business sells a product within the same state, both the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) and the State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) are levied.  The total GST is divided equally between the Centre and the State.  Only in interstate sales, IGST is levied.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Exports are indeed considered "zero-rated" supplies under GST. However, this means that the GST paid in the entire value chain *is* refunded/credited back to the suppliers. This ensures that exports are not burdened by GST, promoting competitiveness in international markets.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the GST Compensation Cess:**

1. The GST Compensation Cess was levied to compensate states for revenue losses due to the implementation of GST, with the compensation period ending on June 30, 2022.
2. The additional shortfall in GST revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic was addressed by the Centre borrowing the amount and passing it on to the states on a back-to-back basis, with the repayment period extending beyond June 30, 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GST Compensation Cess was indeed levied to compensate states for potential revenue losses arising from the implementation of GST. The initial compensation period was set for five years, ending on June 30, 2022. This measure was intended to mitigate the risk of revenue shortfalls for states during the transition to the GST regime.

Statement 2 is also correct. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly exacerbated the GST revenue shortfall faced by states. To address this, the Centre adopted a strategy of borrowing the additional amount and transferring it to states on a back-to-back basis. This mechanism helped states maintain financial stability during the crisis, but it also extended the repayment period for the borrowed amount beyond the initial five-year timeframe.  This extended the period for GST compensation cess.


**9. With reference to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA), 2003, consider the following statements:**

1. The FRBMA mandates the central government to eliminate the revenue deficit by a specific date, and thereafter build up adequate revenue surplus.
2. The FRBMA allows the central government to borrow from the Reserve Bank of India without any restrictions to meet temporary cash flow mismatches.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FRBMA, 2003, sets targets for fiscal consolidation and aims to achieve macroeconomic stability. A key mandate is to eliminate the revenue deficit by a specified date (originally March 31, 2009) and subsequently build up a revenue surplus. This demonstrates the Act's focus on fiscal prudence and long-term sustainability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FRBMA restricts the central government's borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India.  Borrowing is permitted only through advances to meet temporary cash flow mismatches.  This restriction aims to prevent the monetization of deficits and maintain the independence of the central bank's monetary policy.  The FRBMA aims to reduce government dependence on RBI borrowing.


**10. With reference to measures of government deficit, consider the following statements:**

1.  A revenue deficit indicates that the government is using up the savings of other sectors to finance a part of its consumption expenditure.
2.  The primary deficit is calculated by subtracting total revenue receipts from the gross fiscal deficit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A revenue deficit signifies that the government's revenue expenditure exceeds its revenue receipts.  This implies that the government is dissaving, drawing upon the savings of other sectors (households, businesses, etc.) to finance its consumption spending.  This situation can lead to increased reliance on borrowing and potentially unsustainable fiscal practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary deficit is calculated by subtracting *net interest liabilities* (interest payments minus interest receipts) from the gross fiscal deficit.  This measure aims to isolate the borrowing requirement attributable to current expenditure exceeding revenue, excluding the impact of interest obligations on accumulated debt.  Total revenue receipts are not used in calculating the primary deficit.


**1. With reference to the functioning of the Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission's mandate includes recommending the principles governing grants-in-aid to states from the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  The Finance Commission is responsible for determining the allocation of central taxes among states based solely on population figures from the most recent census.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A core function of the Finance Commission, as enshrined in its terms of reference, is to recommend the principles guiding the distribution of grants-in-aid to states from the Consolidated Fund of India.  These grants are crucial for ensuring fiscal equity and addressing the developmental needs of less-developed states.  The commission meticulously examines various factors to arrive at a fair and equitable allocation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While population is a significant parameter considered by the Finance Commission in determining the horizontal distribution of taxes among states, it's not the sole criterion.  The XV Finance Commission, for instance, employed a multi-faceted formula that included income distance, demographic performance, state area, forest cover, and tax effort, in addition to population.  A more nuanced approach is necessary to account for the diverse developmental needs and capacities of different states.  Over-reliance on a single factor like population would lead to an inequitable distribution of resources.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the XV Finance Commission's recommendations (2021-26):**

1.  The vertical devolution of central taxes, representing 41% of the divisible pool, is distributed among all states and union territories.
2.  Grants-in-aid under Article 275 are untied grants, meaning states have unrestricted spending power over these funds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The XV Finance Commission's vertical devolution of central taxes, while amounting to 41% of the divisible pool, is *not* distributed to all union territories.  Union territories without their own legislative assemblies receive funds directly from the Central Government's budgetary resources, allocated through demand for grants under the Ministry of Home Affairs.  This highlights the nuanced approach to fiscal federalism in India, recognizing the varying administrative and fiscal capacities of different entities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Grants-in-aid under Article 275 are *tied* grants, not untied.  This means that their allocation is linked to specific purposes or conditions, unlike untied grants which provide states with complete freedom in their utilization.  The XV Finance Commission's recommendations included various categories of tied grants, such as those for revenue deficit, local bodies, disaster management, and specific sectors, reflecting a targeted approach to addressing particular developmental challenges. The tied nature of these grants ensures accountability and effective resource allocation.


**3. With reference to the "Divisible Pool" of tax resources shared between the Union Government and States, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Divisible Pool" includes all tax revenue collected by the Union Government, including cess and surcharge.
2.  The cost of collecting taxes is deducted from the gross tax revenue before determining the "Divisible Pool."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Divisible Pool" explicitly *excludes* cess and surcharge levied by the Union Government. These are earmarked for specific purposes and are not part of the resources shared with the states. This reflects the constitutional framework and the principles of fiscal federalism in India.  The exclusion of cess and surcharge from the divisible pool ensures that the states receive a clearly defined share of the tax revenue available for distribution.

Statement 2 is correct. The cost of collecting taxes is indeed deducted from the gross tax revenue before calculating the "Divisible Pool." This is a crucial step to ensure that the amount shared with the states accurately reflects the net tax revenue available for distribution.  The cost of collection represents the administrative expenses incurred by the Union Government in collecting taxes, and deducting these costs ensures a more accurate representation of the resources available for sharing.


**4. With reference to the parameters used by the Finance Commission for the horizontal distribution of taxes among states, consider the following statements:**

1.  The parameter "Income Distance" accounts for the difference in per capita income between the highest-ranking state and other states.
2.  The weight assigned to the "Demographic Performance" parameter is higher than the weight assigned to the "State Area" parameter.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "Income Distance" parameter, as used by the Finance Commission, indeed measures the disparity in per capita income between the wealthiest state and other states.  This parameter aims to address regional imbalances and ensure that states with lower per capita incomes receive a larger share of the resources, thereby promoting a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities across the country.  The inclusion of this parameter underscores the commission's commitment to narrowing the development gap between states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The weight assigned to "Demographic Performance" (12.5%) is *lower* than the weight assigned to "State Area" (15%) in the XV Finance Commission's formula.  This indicates that the commission gives greater importance to geographical factors in its allocation formula.  The weight assigned to each parameter reflects the commission's assessment of their relative importance in achieving a balanced and equitable distribution of resources among states.


**5. With reference to the types of grants-in-aid recommended by the XV Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1.  Revenue Deficit Grants are provided to states with revenue deficits after the devolution of funds, ensuring correction of fiscal capacity deficiencies.
2.  Local Body Grants are allocated entirely to rural local bodies, prioritizing rural development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Revenue Deficit Grants are indeed a key component of the XV Finance Commission’s recommendations. They are provided to states exhibiting revenue deficits *after* the devolution of funds from the divisible pool of central taxes.  The commission's aim is to address the fiscal capacity constraints of these states without encouraging inadequate revenue efforts or excessive expenditure.  The allocation of these grants is carefully calibrated to ensure fiscal sustainability and promote responsible fiscal management at the state level.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Local Body Grants, as recommended by the XV Finance Commission, are *not* allocated exclusively to rural local bodies.  A significant portion is allocated to urban local bodies as well, reflecting the commission's recognition of the importance of urban development and the need to address the diverse needs of both rural and urban populations.  The inter-se distribution of these grants between rural and urban local bodies is carefully calibrated, taking into account factors like urbanization trends and future growth prospects.


**6.  Consider the following statements regarding the funding sources for the proposed "Rashtriya Suraksha Naivedyam Kosh":**

1.  The fund will be primarily financed through disinvestment proceeds from Defence Public Sector Enterprises (DPSEs).
2.  Proceeds from the monetization of surplus defence land are included as a potential funding source.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct, but not the primary source. While disinvestment proceeds from DPSEs are indeed proposed as a funding source for the "Rashtriya Suraksha Naivedyam Kosh," it is not the *primary* source. The fund is designed to have multiple sources of funding to ensure its stability and sustainability.  The commission's approach underscores the need for a diversified funding strategy for such a critical fund.

Statement 2 is correct.  The monetization of surplus defence land is explicitly identified as a potential funding source for the proposed fund.  This reflects a broader strategy to optimize the utilization of government assets and generate additional resources for national security.  The inclusion of this source demonstrates a pragmatic approach to resource mobilization for defense modernization. The realization of arrears of payment for defence land used by State Governments and for public projects, and cost recovery of encroached land, are also explicitly mentioned as sources.


**7. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs are implemented by the Central Government and 100% funded by the Centre.
2.  The NITI Aayog's sub-group on rationalization of CSSs recommended that the number of CSSs should ideally not exceed 30.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are *not* implemented solely by the Central Government. They are implemented jointly by the Central and State Governments, with funding shared between them in pre-determined ratios (e.g., 50:50, 70:30).  This collaborative approach is designed to leverage the expertise and resources of both levels of government to achieve common development goals.  The shared implementation and funding reflect the principles of cooperative federalism in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The NITI Aayog's sub-group on rationalization of CSSs did indeed recommend that the number of CSSs should be limited to a maximum of 30. This recommendation aimed to streamline the implementation of CSSs, improve their effectiveness, and enhance the overall efficiency of government spending.  The recommendation reflects a broader effort to improve governance and optimize resource allocation in the context of India's development priorities.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) of 2003:**

1. The FRBM Act mandates the elimination of the revenue deficit by a specific year.
2. The FRBM Act applies equally to both the Central and State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The FRBM Act, 2003, originally mandated the elimination of the revenue deficit by March 31, 2009.  This target, while not always fully achieved, underscored the Act's commitment to fiscal prudence and the importance of aligning government revenue and expenditure.  The revenue deficit target reflected a key objective of the Act: to improve the quality of government expenditure and reduce reliance on deficit financing.  While the target year has passed, the principle of reducing revenue deficit remains a core element of fiscal policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FRBM Act, 2003, primarily applies to the *Central* Government.  While some states have enacted their own fiscal responsibility legislation, the FRBM Act itself does not have direct applicability to them.  This reflects the constitutional framework of India's federal system, where the Centre and States have separate fiscal responsibilities and legislative powers.  The lack of uniform implementation across all states presents challenges to achieving coordinated fiscal consolidation at the national level.


**9. With reference to the concept of "crowding out," consider the following statements:**

1. Crowding out occurs when increased government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, reducing private investment.
2. Crowding out is more likely to occur when an economy is operating at full capacity, with limited unutilized resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The concept of "crowding out" accurately describes the phenomenon where increased government borrowing to finance deficits puts upward pressure on interest rates. This happens because the government competes with private borrowers for a limited pool of savings. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for private firms, potentially leading to a reduction in their investment plans. This effect is central to debates about the impact of fiscal deficits on economic growth.

Statement 2 is correct. Crowding out is more pronounced when the economy is operating at or near its full capacity. In such a scenario, there are limited unutilized resources, and increased government spending leads to a direct competition for these resources. This intensifies the upward pressure on interest rates and the potential for crowding out private investment.  When resources are abundant, increased government spending can stimulate economic activity without necessarily leading to a significant crowding-out effect.


**10. With reference to the relationship between fiscal deficit and inflation, consider the following statements:**

1. Large fiscal deficits always lead to high inflation.
2. Fiscal deficits can be inflationary if the economy is operating at full capacity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While fiscal deficits can contribute to inflation, it's not an automatic or inevitable consequence.  If an economy has significant unutilized capacity (unemployed resources), increased government spending can boost output without necessarily causing inflationary pressure. The impact of fiscal deficits on inflation depends on the state of the economy and the interaction between aggregate demand and aggregate supply.  The presence of slack in the economy can absorb the increased demand without leading to a price increase.

Statement 2 is correct. Fiscal deficits are more likely to be inflationary when the economy is operating at or near its full capacity. In this scenario, increased government spending or tax cuts lead to higher aggregate demand, which cannot be fully met by increased production due to resource constraints.  This excess demand puts upward pressure on prices, leading to inflation.  The relationship between fiscal deficit and inflation is therefore context-dependent and influenced by the level of resource utilization in the economy.  The extent of inflationary pressure also depends on the monetary policy response.


**1. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST Council's recommendations regarding primary legislations, such as amendments to the CGST/SGST Acts, are legally binding on both the Union and State Governments.
2.  The GST regime has subsumed more than 17 Central and State indirect taxes, creating a unified national market for goods and services.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A Supreme Court judgment clarified that the GST Council's recommendations are recommendatory in nature and not legally binding on the Union and State Governments for primary legislation. While the recommendations hold persuasive value, the Parliament and State Legislatures retain the power to legislate independently on GST matters.  The binding nature of the Council's decisions primarily applies to secondary or subordinate legislations, such as changes in tax rates or rules under CGST/SGST/IGST.

Statement 2 is correct. The GST regime successfully integrated numerous Central and State indirect taxes, including Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Service Tax, VAT, Entertainment tax, Entry tax, Purchase Tax, and Luxury tax. This consolidation aimed to create a single, unified national market, eliminating the complexities and inefficiencies of a multi-layered tax system.  The simplification of the tax structure was intended to reduce compliance costs for businesses and improve ease of doing business in India.  This unification is a cornerstone of the GST's design and a key achievement of the reform.


**2. With reference to the challenges faced in implementing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The multiple tax rate slabs under GST, including additional cesses, have contributed to a complicated tax structure, hindering ease of compliance.
2.  The exclusion of alcohol, petroleum products, and electricity from the GST base has negatively impacted the competitiveness of Indian industries by embedding taxes in manufacturing costs.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GST Council initially opted for a multi-rate structure (5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%), along with exempt categories and additional cesses. This complexity contrasts with the initial aim of a simplified, single tax system. The multiple rates and cesses increased the administrative burden for businesses and made compliance more challenging. This complexity has been a significant criticism of the GST implementation.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The decision to keep certain crucial items like alcohol, petroleum products, and electricity outside the GST ambit has had significant adverse effects on Indian industries.  Taxes on these essential inputs are embedded in the final product's cost, preventing manufacturers from claiming input tax credits. This increases the cost of production for Indian businesses, reducing their competitiveness compared to those in countries with more comprehensive GST systems. This exclusion undermines the very principle of seamless tax credit across the value chain, which was a core objective of GST.


**3. With reference to the fiscal policy instruments used by the Indian government, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in government expenditure, financed by borrowing, leads to a fiscal deficit, potentially crowding out private investment by increasing competition for available savings.
2.  A reduction in proportional taxes acts as an automatic stabilizer, making disposable income and consumer spending less sensitive to fluctuations in GDP.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. When the government increases its expenditure without a corresponding increase in tax revenue, it leads to a fiscal deficit. This deficit is typically financed through borrowing, which increases the demand for loanable funds. This increased demand can lead to higher interest rates, making it more expensive for private businesses to borrow and invest. This phenomenon is known as crowding out – where government borrowing reduces the funds available for private sector investment.  This is a crucial aspect of understanding the macroeconomic implications of fiscal policy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Proportional taxes, where the tax rate is a fixed percentage of income, act as automatic stabilizers. During economic booms, higher incomes lead to increased tax revenue, reducing aggregate demand and curbing inflationary pressures. Conversely, during recessions, lower incomes result in reduced tax revenue, increasing disposable income and mitigating the decline in aggregate demand. This inherent characteristic of proportional taxes helps to moderate economic fluctuations without requiring any discretionary policy intervention.


**4. With reference to the functioning of the Finance Commission in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission's recommendations on the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Centre and States (vertical devolution) are binding on the Union Government but not on State Governments.
2.  The XV Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool of Central taxes for devolution to the States, distributed among 28 States based on parameters including income distance, population, and demographic performance.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential, they are not legally binding on either the Union or State Governments.  They serve as crucial guidelines for resource allocation and fiscal federalism but do not carry the force of law.  The acceptance and implementation of these recommendations depend on the political will and budgetary priorities of both the central and state governments.

Statement 2 is correct. The XV Finance Commission did recommend a 41% share of the divisible pool of Central taxes for vertical devolution to the States.  This devolution was to be distributed among the 28 States using a multi-criteria formula that considered several factors, including income distance, population (based on the 2011 census), demographic performance, state area, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal effort.  This illustrates the complex considerations involved in distributing central tax revenue among the states, aiming for equitable distribution while acknowledging varying needs and capacities.


**5. With reference to the different types of subsidies provided by the Indian government, consider the following statements:**

1.  Price subsidies, while intended to benefit the poor, often prove regressive as richer households consume more subsidized goods and services than poorer ones.
2.  Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) aims to improve the efficiency of subsidy delivery by transferring cash directly to beneficiaries' accounts, reducing leakages and market distortions associated with price subsidies.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Price subsidies, while aiming to alleviate poverty by lowering the prices of essential goods and services, often disproportionately benefit wealthier households. This is because wealthier households generally consume a larger quantity of these goods than poorer households.  For example, subsidies on electricity benefit wealthier households more because they consume more electricity. This regressive nature of price subsidies is a major criticism and motivates the shift towards alternative mechanisms.

Statement 2 is also correct. DBT is designed to address the inefficiencies and leakages inherent in traditional price subsidies.  By directly transferring cash to beneficiaries' accounts linked to Aadhaar, the government aims to ensure that the intended beneficiaries receive the subsidy without intermediaries or diversions.  This system also helps to avoid market distortions caused by artificially low prices. The shift to DBT represents a significant reform effort to improve the targeting and efficiency of social welfare programs.


**6. With reference to land reforms in India post-independence, consider the following statements:**

1.  The abolition of intermediaries, such as zamindars and jaghirdars, aimed to establish a direct relationship between cultivators and the government, but faced challenges due to inadequate land records and ambiguities in defining "personal cultivation."
2.  Tenancy reforms, while intended to secure the rights of tenants, faced implementation challenges due to the lack of strong enforcement mechanisms and the persistence of informal tenancy arrangements.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The abolition of intermediaries was a major land reform initiative post-independence, aiming to eliminate exploitative intermediary systems and establish a more equitable land ownership structure.  However, this reform encountered significant challenges. The lack of accurate and comprehensive land records hindered the effective identification of landholdings and the fair distribution of land to cultivators.  Furthermore, the vague definition of "personal cultivation" allowed many former intermediaries to retain significant landholdings, undermining the reform's intended impact.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Tenancy reforms aimed to protect the rights of tenants and sharecroppers, ensuring fair rent and security of tenure.  However, the implementation of these reforms proved difficult. Weak enforcement mechanisms allowed landlords to circumvent the legal provisions, often maintaining informal tenancy arrangements that continued to exploit tenants.  The lack of effective monitoring and redressal mechanisms contributed to the limited success of tenancy reforms in many parts of India.


**1. With reference to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) Act, 2003, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates the central government to eliminate the revenue deficit by a specific date and build up an adequate revenue surplus thereafter.  
2. The Act allows for exceeding fiscal deficit targets only under exceptional circumstances such as national security threats or natural calamities, with any deviation limited to a pre-defined percentage of GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FRBM Act, 2003, aimed to improve India's fiscal management. Statement 1 is correct because the Act originally mandated the central government to eliminate the revenue deficit by March 31, 2009, and subsequently build a revenue surplus. This was a crucial element of the Act’s strategy for fiscal consolidation.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The Act includes an "escape clause" that permits exceeding fiscal deficit targets under exceptional circumstances like national security crises or natural disasters.  However, these deviations are not unlimited; they are subject to specific conditions and limitations, usually defined as a percentage of GDP. The Act aims to balance fiscal prudence with the need for flexibility to respond to unforeseen events.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key provisions of the FRBM Act. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only partially address the provisions of the Act, and option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually accurate representations of the Act's core objectives and provisions.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding government deficits:**

1.  A larger fiscal deficit always indicates a more expansionary fiscal policy.
2.  A revenue deficit implies that the government is using the savings of other sectors to finance a portion of its consumption expenditure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A larger fiscal deficit does not automatically signify a more expansionary fiscal policy. The size of the deficit is influenced by both government spending and revenue.  A decline in economic activity (recession) can lead to lower tax revenues, thus increasing the deficit even without changes in government spending. Conversely, increased government spending during a recession (counter-cyclical policy) aims to stimulate the economy, but this may also result in a larger deficit.  Therefore, the deficit size alone doesn't fully reflect the policy's expansionary nature.  Statement 2 is correct. A revenue deficit arises when revenue expenditure exceeds revenue receipts.  This means the government is spending more than it earns from taxes and other non-borrowing sources to fund its day-to-day operations.  To cover this shortfall, it has to borrow from other sectors of the economy, essentially using their savings.  This can lead to increased public debt and potentially crowd out private investment. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the relationship between fiscal deficits, fiscal policy, and revenue deficits.


**3. With reference to the components of revenue receipts of the Union Government, consider the following statements:**

1.  Disinvestment receipts are a significant component of revenue receipts.
2.  Corporate tax receipts form a major source of revenue for the Union Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Disinvestment receipts, which arise from the sale of government shares in Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), are considered capital receipts, not revenue receipts. Revenue receipts represent income earned by the government through taxes, fees, and other non-borrowing sources, while capital receipts involve borrowing or the sale of assets.  Statement 2 is correct. Corporate tax receipts constitute a substantial portion of the Union Government's revenue. Corporate taxes are levied on the profits earned by companies, and this source contributes significantly to the government's overall revenue stream. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to accurately differentiate between capital and revenue receipts and the relative importance of various sources of revenue for the Union Government.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding public goods:**

1. Public goods are non-rivalrous, meaning one person's consumption doesn't diminish another's enjoyment.
2.  Private enterprises generally provide public goods due to their profitability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A defining characteristic of public goods is their non-rivalrous nature.  Multiple individuals can simultaneously consume a public good without reducing the availability or enjoyment for others. For example, national defense benefits all citizens equally, regardless of individual consumption.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Private enterprises typically do *not* provide public goods. This is because public goods are often non-excludable, meaning it's difficult or impossible to prevent individuals from consuming them even if they don't pay. This makes it challenging to charge for their use, reducing profitability for private businesses.  The free-rider problem, where individuals benefit without contributing, further discourages private provision.  Therefore, governments usually provide public goods to ensure their availability. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the fundamental characteristics of public goods and their provision in a market economy.


**5. With reference to the impact of taxes, consider the following statements:**

1. A tax is shifted forward to consumers if the supply is relatively more inelastic than demand.
2. A tax is shifted backward to producers if the demand is relatively more inelastic than supply.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The direction of tax incidence (who ultimately bears the burden of the tax) depends on the relative elasticities of supply and demand.  Statement 1 incorrectly states that a tax is shifted forward to consumers when supply is more inelastic.  In reality, a tax is shifted forward to consumers if *demand* is relatively inelastic compared to supply.  When demand is inelastic, consumers are less responsive to price changes, meaning they will continue to purchase the good even with a higher price (caused by the tax), thus bearing the burden.  Statement 2 incorrectly says a tax is shifted backward to producers when demand is more inelastic.  A tax is shifted backward to producers if *supply* is relatively more inelastic than demand.  If supply is inelastic, producers are less able to reduce output in response to the tax, absorbing more of the tax burden.  Therefore, the correct relationships between elasticity and tax incidence are opposite to what's stated in the given statements.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the principles of tax incidence and the role of elasticity in determining the distribution of tax burdens.


**6.  With reference to the measures of government deficit, consider the following statements:**

1. The primary deficit is the fiscal deficit minus net interest payments.
2. The revenue deficit is the difference between total government expenditure and total receipts excluding borrowing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The primary deficit is calculated by subtracting net interest payments from the fiscal deficit.  This provides a measure of the government's deficit excluding interest payments on its accumulated debt, focusing solely on current fiscal imbalances.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The revenue deficit is the difference between the government's revenue expenditure and its revenue receipts.  It does not involve total expenditure or borrowing.  The fiscal deficit, on the other hand, accounts for total expenditure minus total receipts (excluding borrowing). Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the definitions and calculations of the primary deficit and the revenue deficit, which are crucial concepts in public finance.


**7. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. A trade deficit always indicates a decline in national savings.
2.  A trade deficit can be financed by net capital inflows.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A trade deficit (imports exceeding exports) does not automatically imply a decline in national savings.  A trade deficit can occur even when national savings are increasing if investment is rising faster than savings, leading to borrowing from abroad to finance the investment.  The relationship between trade deficits and savings is more complex than a simple inverse correlation.  Statement 2 is correct.  A trade deficit necessitates financing from external sources.  This financing is typically achieved through net capital inflows, which represent an increase in capital investments into the country from foreign sources.  These inflows compensate for the excess of imports over exports, balancing the country's balance of payments.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect, failing to accurately reflect the intricate relationship between trade deficits, national savings, and capital flows in an open economy.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding counter-cyclical fiscal policy:**

1. Counter-cyclical fiscal policy involves increasing government expenditure during economic booms.
2. Counter-cyclical fiscal policy aims to stabilize the economy by moderating both booms and recessions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Counter-cyclical fiscal policy operates *against* the prevailing economic cycle. During economic booms, when inflation is a concern, counter-cyclical policy would involve *reducing* government expenditure and/or increasing taxes to curb aggregate demand and prevent overheating.  Statement 2 is correct. The core objective of counter-cyclical fiscal policy is to stabilize the economy by smoothing out the fluctuations of the business cycle.  During recessions, it involves stimulating aggregate demand through increased government spending and/or tax cuts.  During booms, it aims to cool down the economy to prevent inflationary pressures.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the fundamental principles and application of counter-cyclical fiscal policy in managing economic fluctuations.


**9. With reference to the expenditure method of calculating GDP, consider the following statements:**

1.  Government consumption expenditure includes both consumption and capital goods purchased by the government.
2.  The expenditure method adds up all expenditures on final goods and services by households, firms, the government, and the external sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Government consumption expenditure, as part of GDP calculation, encompasses both final consumption goods (like salaries of government employees) and capital goods (like infrastructure investments) acquired by the government.  This is because both contribute to the overall economic output.  Statement 2 is also correct. The expenditure method of GDP calculation precisely sums up the final expenditures on goods and services by all economic agents within a country's boundaries.  This includes household consumption (C), private investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (X-M).  Therefore, both statements accurately describe the components and approach of the expenditure method for GDP calculation. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not fully and accurately reflect the expenditure method's approach and components in measuring a nation's GDP.


**10. With reference to the income method of calculating GDP, consider the following statements:**

1.  The income method sums up all factor incomes, including wages, rent, interest, and profits, earned within a country's domestic territory.
2.  Transfer payments, such as pensions and unemployment benefits, are included in GDP calculations using the income method.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The income method of GDP calculation adds up all factor incomes generated within a country's borders during a specific period. These factor incomes represent payments made to the factors of production—labor (wages), capital (interest), land (rent), and entrepreneurship (profit).  Statement 2 is incorrect. Transfer payments are not included in GDP calculations using any method, including the income method. Transfer payments represent income transfers from one sector to another without corresponding production of goods or services.  They are not part of the value added in the economy.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the income method's approach in calculating GDP, failing to distinguish between factor incomes and transfer payments.


**1. With reference to the components of National Income accounting, consider the following statements:**

1.  Net National Product at market prices is calculated by subtracting depreciation from Gross National Product at market prices.
2.  Net National Product at factor cost (National Income) is derived by adjusting Net National Product at market prices for net indirect taxes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Net National Product (NNP) represents the value of goods and services produced by a nation after accounting for depreciation (capital consumption).  Depreciation reflects the wear and tear of capital goods during production. Subtracting depreciation from Gross National Product (GNP) at market prices yields NNP at market prices. This is a fundamental concept in national income accounting.

Statement 2 is also correct. NNP at market prices includes indirect taxes (taxes levied on production or sale of goods and services).  To arrive at NNP at factor cost (also known as National Income), these indirect taxes must be deducted.  Conversely, subsidies (government payments to producers) are added.  Therefore, the adjustment involves subtracting net indirect taxes (indirect taxes minus subsidies) from NNP at market prices. This reflects the income actually received by the factors of production.  Understanding the difference between market prices and factor cost is crucial for analyzing economic performance accurately.  The factor cost approach provides a truer picture of the income generated within an economy.


**2. With reference to the calculation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), consider the following statements:**

1. The product method calculates GDP by summing the value-added at each stage of production, ensuring that intermediate goods are not double-counted.
2. The expenditure method calculates GDP by adding up all final expenditures in the economy, including consumption, investment, government spending, exports, and subtracting imports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe two key methods of calculating GDP.

Statement 1 correctly explains the product or value-added method. This approach avoids double-counting by only considering the value added at each stage of production.  The value added is the difference between the value of output and the value of intermediate goods used in production.  Summing the value added across all sectors of the economy provides a comprehensive measure of GDP.  This method is particularly useful for understanding the contribution of different industries to the overall economy.

Statement 2 accurately describes the expenditure method. This approach focuses on the final demand for goods and services. It sums up the spending by households (consumption), businesses (investment), the government (government spending), and net exports (exports minus imports). This method highlights the various sources of demand driving economic activity.  It is important to note that only final goods and services are counted, as intermediate goods are already incorporated in the price of final goods.  The expenditure method is often used to analyze the components of aggregate demand and their impact on economic growth.


**3. With reference to macroeconomic variables and their relationships, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gross National Product (GNP) equals Gross Domestic Product (GDP) plus net factor income from abroad.
2.  Net National Product (NNP) at factor cost is equivalent to National Income and is obtained by deducting depreciation from GNP at market prices and adjusting for net indirect taxes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. GNP is a broader measure of national income than GDP.  GDP only considers production within a country's borders. GNP adds income earned by domestic factors of production employed abroad (e.g., Indian workers working overseas) and subtracts income earned within the country by foreign factors of production (e.g., foreign workers in India).  The difference between these two components is called net factor income from abroad (NFIA).  Therefore, GNP = GDP + NFIA. This distinction is crucial for understanding the income accruing to a nation's residents, regardless of the location of production.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NNP at factor cost is indeed equivalent to National Income, the calculation is not directly derived from GNP at market prices by simply deducting depreciation and adjusting for net indirect taxes.  The correct procedure is to start with GDP at market prices, deduct depreciation to get NDP at market prices, then adjust for net indirect taxes to arrive at NDP at factor cost, and finally add net factor income from abroad to obtain NNP at factor cost or National Income.  The sequence and the starting point of calculation matter significantly in obtaining the correct National Income figure. This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the intricacies of national accounts.


**4. With reference to Personal Income and Personal Disposable Income, consider the following statements:**

1. Personal Income is calculated by subtracting undistributed profits, net interest payments made by households, and corporate taxes from National Income, while adding transfer payments from the government and firms.
2. Personal Disposable Income is obtained by subtracting personal tax payments and non-tax payments from Personal Income.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly define Personal Income (PI) and Personal Disposable Income (PDI) within the context of national income accounting.

Statement 1 accurately describes the components of Personal Income.  National Income (NI) represents the total income earned by factors of production within an economy.  However, not all of this income accrues directly to households.  Undistributed profits (profits retained by corporations), net interest payments made by households (interest paid minus interest received), and corporate taxes are all deducted from NI.  Conversely, transfer payments (payments made without a corresponding exchange of goods or services) from the government and firms are added to account for income received by households that is not directly linked to factor payments.   Understanding these adjustments provides a clear picture of the income available to households for spending and saving.

Statement 2 correctly defines Personal Disposable Income.  Personal Income is the income received by households.  However, households are subject to taxes and other payments.  Subtracting personal tax payments (income tax, etc.) and non-tax payments (fines, etc.) from Personal Income yields Personal Disposable Income (PDI). PDI represents the income households have at their disposal to either consume or save.  This is a crucial measure for understanding household spending patterns and consumption behavior.


**5. With reference to the government's budget and its components, consider the following statements:**

1. Revenue deficit occurs when revenue expenditure exceeds revenue receipts.
2. Fiscal deficit represents the difference between total government expenditure and total government receipts (excluding borrowings).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately define key aspects of a government's budget.

Statement 1 correctly defines revenue deficit. Revenue expenditure refers to government spending that doesn't result in the creation of assets (e.g., salaries, subsidies, interest payments). Revenue receipts are funds received by the government through taxes and other non-borrowing sources.  A revenue deficit indicates that the government is spending more on day-to-day activities than it is earning from non-borrowing sources. This situation necessitates borrowing to finance the shortfall, potentially leading to increased government debt.

Statement 2 accurately defines fiscal deficit. This is a broader measure of the government's borrowing needs.  It is calculated as the difference between total government expenditure (revenue and capital expenditure) and total government receipts (including revenue receipts and non-debt capital receipts). In essence, fiscal deficit represents the amount the government needs to borrow to finance its expenditure.  A high fiscal deficit can be a cause for concern, as it may indicate unsustainable levels of government debt.  The difference between revenue deficit and fiscal deficit is critical for understanding the nature and sustainability of government finances.


**6. With reference to the impact of government policies on the economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Proportional income taxes act as automatic stabilizers, reducing the sensitivity of disposable income and consumption to fluctuations in GDP.
2.  An increase in government expenditure, financed by an equal increase in taxes (balanced budget), leads to a one-to-one increase in equilibrium income.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe the effects of government policies, specifically focusing on fiscal policy and its automatic stabilization properties.

Statement 1 accurately describes the role of proportional income taxes as automatic stabilizers.  Proportional taxes mean that the tax rate remains constant regardless of income level. During economic booms, when GDP rises, tax revenues increase automatically, reducing disposable income and thus dampening consumption spending and inflationary pressures. Conversely, during recessions, when GDP falls, tax revenues decrease, increasing disposable income and providing some support to consumption.  This inherent responsiveness of the tax system helps moderate economic fluctuations.  Automatic stabilizers are a crucial component of macroeconomic policy.

Statement 2 accurately describes the effect of a balanced budget multiplier.  When the government increases spending and finances it through an equal increase in taxes, the net effect on equilibrium income is an increase equal to the increase in government spending.  This is because the initial increase in government spending directly boosts aggregate demand.  While the tax increase reduces disposable income and consumption, the overall effect on equilibrium income is still positive due to the multiplier effect.  The balanced budget multiplier is a significant concept in Keynesian economics illustrating how fiscal policy can stimulate economic activity.


**7. With reference to the concept of money and its functions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money serves as a medium of exchange, eliminating the need for a double coincidence of wants that characterizes barter systems.
2.  Money functions as a store of value, enabling individuals to defer consumption and accumulate wealth, although its value can be affected by inflation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe essential functions of money in a modern economy.

Statement 1 correctly identifies money's role as a medium of exchange.  Barter systems require a "double coincidence of wants," where two individuals must each possess what the other desires to trade.  This creates significant transaction costs and limits the efficiency of exchange. Money overcomes this limitation by serving as a universally accepted medium of exchange.  Any good or service can be exchanged for money, which can then be used to acquire other goods and services.  This increases efficiency and facilitates economic activity.

Statement 2 correctly describes money's function as a store of value.  Money allows individuals to save a portion of their income for future use.  This enables deferred consumption, providing a crucial link between present income and future spending.  However, it's important to note that the value of money as a store of value can be eroded by inflation, which decreases the purchasing power of money over time.  Therefore, the stability of money's value is a critical factor in its effectiveness as a store of value.  This understanding of money's dual roles is fundamental to macroeconomics.



**8.  With reference to the demand for money, consider the following statements:**

1. Transaction demand for money is primarily driven by the need to facilitate everyday purchases and payments, and it is positively related to the level of income.
2. Speculative demand for money arises from the desire to hold assets that can quickly be converted to cash, and it is inversely related to the expected rate of return on alternative investments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the transaction demand for money.  This component of money demand reflects the need for cash to conduct everyday transactions.  As income levels rise, individuals and businesses typically need more money to meet their increased spending needs.  Therefore, transaction demand is positively related to income.  This is a fundamental aspect of monetary theory, illustrating the direct link between economic activity and the demand for money.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading in its phrasing. While the desire to hold assets quickly convertible to cash is a motive for holding money, this isn't precisely the definition of speculative demand. Speculative demand is primarily driven by the anticipation of changes in interest rates. If individuals expect interest rates to rise, they will reduce their money holdings (as the opportunity cost of holding money increases) and invest in other assets. Conversely, if they anticipate interest rates to fall, they will increase their money holdings, anticipating capital gains from holding bonds or other interest-bearing securities.  The statement incorrectly links speculative demand to the rate of return on *all* alternative investments, when it is specifically tied to interest rate expectations.  The nuance between the motivation to hold liquid assets and the specific nature of speculative demand makes this a challenging concept to grasp fully.  A thorough understanding of these different motives for holding money is essential for analyzing monetary policy.


**1. With reference to the distribution of tax proceeds between the Centre and States in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The vertical devolution, representing the percentage share of central taxes allocated to states, is always a part of the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  The horizontal devolution, outlining the distribution of tax proceeds among states, considers parameters like income distance, population, and state area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The vertical devolution, representing the percentage share of central taxes allocated to states, is *not* part of the Consolidated Fund of India.  It's distributed as untied grants, meaning states have discretion over how to spend them. The Consolidated Fund of India is a separate entity.  This is a crucial point for understanding the financial relationship between the Centre and the States.  The untied nature of these grants allows for greater flexibility for the states in addressing their specific needs.

Statement 2 is correct. The horizontal devolution, indeed, employs various parameters to distribute the shared tax proceeds among states. These parameters ensure a degree of fairness and address the developmental disparities between states.  The inclusion of factors like income distance, population (based on the 2011 census), demographic performance, state area, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal effort reflects a multi-faceted approach to resource allocation.  The weight assigned to each parameter plays a significant role in shaping the final distribution.  Understanding the rationale behind these parameters is vital for analyzing India's fiscal federalism.


**2. With reference to Grants-in-Aid provided by the Centre to States in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Grants-in-aid, as stipulated under Article 275 of the Constitution, are always untied grants, allowing states complete flexibility in their utilization.
2.  The XV Finance Commission recommended grants-in-aid categorized into revenue deficit grants, local body grants, and disaster management grants, amongst others.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While some grants-in-aid might be untied,  Article 275 allows for both tied and untied grants. Tied grants are allocated for specific purposes, while untied grants allow states more flexibility.  The nature of the grant depends on the specific recommendation of the Finance Commission and the needs being addressed. The distinction between tied and untied grants is essential in understanding the Centre's influence on state-level spending priorities.

Statement 2 is correct. The XV Finance Commission did indeed recommend several categories of grants-in-aid, including revenue deficit grants (to address revenue shortfalls post-devolution), local body grants (to support Panchayats and Municipalities), and disaster management grants.  These categories demonstrate a strategic approach to providing financial assistance to states, targeting different aspects of their financial and developmental needs.  The specific allocation within each category also reflects considerations of need and performance.


**3. With reference to the "Divisible Pool" of tax resources in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Divisible Pool includes all tax revenues collected by the Union Government, including cess and surcharge.
2.  Union Territories with their own Assemblies are also included in the distribution of the Divisible Pool.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Divisible Pool *excludes* certain items from the gross tax revenue of the Union Government.  These exclusions include the cost of tax collection, cess and surcharge, tax revenue of Union Territories, and National Calamity Contingency Duty.  Understanding these exclusions is crucial for accurate assessment of the resources available for sharing with the states.  The exclusion of cess and surcharge, for instance, reflects the Centre’s retention of specific funds for particular purposes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Union Territories (UTs) with their own Assemblies are *not* allocated funds from the Divisible Pool.  UTs without their own Assemblies receive funds directly from the Central Government's budgetary resources.  This difference in funding mechanisms reflects the varying constitutional statuses and administrative arrangements of UTs within the Indian federal structure.  The distinction highlights the complexities of fiscal relations within the Indian federal system.


**4. With reference to the parameters used for horizontal distribution of taxes among states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The principle of "Income Distance" prioritizes allocating a larger share to states with the highest per capita income to further enhance their economic growth.
2.  "Demographic Performance" is a parameter that considers factors influencing population growth and distribution, such as birth rates and mortality rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The principle of "Income Distance" aims to *reduce* the income gap between the most affluent and least affluent states. It doesn't prioritize states with the highest income; rather, it allocates resources to narrow the developmental gap. This reflects a policy focus on inclusive growth and reducing regional disparities. The weighting given to this parameter indicates the importance of addressing economic inequality.

Statement 2 is correct. "Demographic Performance" indeed encompasses factors related to population dynamics.  It assesses aspects such as birth rates, mortality rates, and population density, which influence a state's developmental challenges and resource requirements.  The inclusion of this parameter underscores the importance of considering population-related factors in resource allocation.


**5. With reference to the XV Finance Commission's recommendations on sector-specific grants, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sector-specific grants were recommended only for those sectors showing significant progress in achieving their targets.
2.  The recommendations included performance-based incentives for sectors like school education, higher education, and the implementation of agricultural reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The XV Finance Commission recommended sector-specific grants to various sectors, irrespective of their past performance.  While some grants might have been performance-based, incentivizing better outcomes, others were aimed at strengthening weaker areas or addressing specific developmental needs. The allocation of grants wasn't solely contingent on past achievements; it also considered future potential and national priorities.

Statement 2 is correct. The XV Finance Commission's recommendations included performance-based incentives or grants for various sectors including school education, higher education, and the implementation of agricultural reforms (with incentives linked to specific areas like land lease reforms, water use efficiency, and export promotion).  The focus on performance-based incentives demonstrates a results-oriented approach to public spending, seeking to improve outcomes in key sectors.


**6. With reference to the  "Rashtriya Suraksha Naivedyam Kosh" (or similar named fund) recommended by the XV Finance Commission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The fund's primary objective is to exclusively finance capital investments for the modernization of state police forces.
2.  The fund's sources of funding include transfers from the Consolidated Fund of India and proceeds from the monetization of surplus defence land.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The recommended fund, aimed at bridging the gap between budgetary requirements and allocations for defence and internal security, has a broader objective. While modernization of state police forces is included, it also encompasses capital investments for the modernization of defence services and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), along with a welfare component for personnel.  The multi-faceted nature of the fund's objectives reflects the interconnectedness of defence and internal security needs.

Statement 2 is correct. The proposed sources of funding for the fund include transfers from the Consolidated Fund of India, disinvestment proceeds from Defence Public Sector Enterprises (DPSEs), proceeds from the monetization of surplus defence land (including arrears from state governments and public projects), and proceeds from future land transfers.  The diverse sources of funding reflect a strategic approach to securing resources for this crucial area of national security.


**7. With reference to the  differences between Central Sector Schemes (CSS) and Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Central Sector Schemes are implemented by central agencies and entirely funded by the Centre, typically on subjects within the Union List.
2.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes involve cost-sharing between the Centre and States, with the States implementing the schemes on subjects under the State List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Central Sector Schemes are indeed implemented by central agencies and are 100% funded by the Centre. These schemes typically fall under subjects listed in the Union List of the Constitution, reflecting the Centre’s primary responsibility in these areas.  Examples such as Namami Gange and Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana illustrate this pattern.

Statement 2 is also correct. Centrally Sponsored Schemes involve cost-sharing between the Centre and States, with the implementation responsibility resting with the States.  These schemes often address subjects under the State List, but the Centre’s involvement reflects a collaborative approach to addressing national priorities. The varying cost-sharing ratios (e.g., 50:50, 70:30) reflect the relative importance assigned to the scheme by the Centre and the States.


**8. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  GST subsumed only state-level indirect taxes such as VAT and Entry Tax, leaving central-level indirect taxes untouched.
2.  The GST Council's recommendations on matters related to GST are binding on both the Union and State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GST subsumed both central and state-level indirect taxes.  Central taxes such as Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, and Service Tax were also integrated into the GST framework.  The unification of both central and state-level taxes was a crucial aspect of the GST reform, aiming to create a single, unified indirect tax system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GST Council's recommendations are *recommendatory* in nature, not binding.  While they carry significant weight, the Union and State Governments retain the autonomy to make their own legislative decisions.  This reflects the balance of power within the Indian federal system.  The Council's role is primarily to foster consensus and cooperation between the Centre and States on GST-related matters.  The Supreme Court's judgement further clarified this aspect of the GST Council's powers.


**9. With reference to the "GST Compensation Cess" in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Cess was imposed to compensate states for revenue shortfalls arising from the implementation of GST, with a fixed duration irrespective of revenue shortfalls.
2.  The proceeds of the GST Compensation Cess were credited to the Consolidated Fund of India before being transferred to the States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Compensation Cess was initially designed to compensate states for revenue shortfalls for a period of five years (July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2022),  but the duration was extended due to the significant revenue shortfalls caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The compensation was not entirely independent of the actual revenue shortfalls experienced by the states.


Statement 2 is correct. The GST Compensation Cess was collected by the Centre and credited to the Consolidated Fund of India before being transferred to the GST Compensation Fund (under the Public Account of India) and subsequently to the States' Consolidated Funds. This process reflects the constitutional framework for the handling of tax revenues and transfers to States.  The transfer mechanism highlights the financial management practices involved in intergovernmental fiscal relations.


**10.  With reference to the different types of subsidies provided by the Indian government, consider the following statements:**

1.  Price subsidies are generally considered progressive, benefiting poorer households more than wealthier households.
2.  Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) aims to reduce leakages and improve the targeting of subsidies by transferring funds directly to beneficiaries' accounts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Price subsidies are often regressive, meaning wealthier households tend to benefit more due to higher consumption levels of subsidized goods and services (e.g., electricity, LPG). This is because the subsidy is applied to the price of the good or service, rather than being targeted at specific income levels.  The regressive nature of price subsidies is a significant concern in terms of their effectiveness in poverty reduction.

Statement 2 is correct. DBT aims to increase the efficiency and transparency of subsidy delivery by transferring funds directly to beneficiaries’ accounts. This reduces leakages and diversion of funds, which are common problems associated with traditional price subsidy mechanisms.  The JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile) trinity has played a significant role in facilitating the implementation of DBT.  The shift to DBT also promotes financial inclusion by encouraging the use of bank accounts.


**11. With reference to the characteristics of Universal Basic Income (UBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  UBI is a conditional cash transfer program, requiring beneficiaries to meet specific criteria such as work participation or income level.
2.  UBI payments are typically made on a household basis, rather than on an individual basis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UBI is, by definition, an *unconditional* cash transfer.  It is provided to all citizens regardless of their employment status or income level.  The unconditional nature of UBI is a central feature of its design and philosophy, aiming to provide a basic safety net for all members of society.  The debate around UBI often revolves around the potential impacts of this unconditional nature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. UBI payments are typically made on an *individual* basis, not on a household basis.  This ensures that each citizen receives the guaranteed minimum income, regardless of their household's overall income or composition.  The individual-based nature of UBI reflects its focus on individual rights and social justice.  Providing payments on a household basis would potentially disadvantage certain individuals within a household.


**12. With reference to the Indian government's approach to providing support to the poor, consider the following statements:**

1.  Income support, unlike price subsidies and DBT, does not distort market mechanisms.
2.  The phasing out of kerosene subsidies is primarily driven by the declining use of kerosene due to increased electricity access and LPG adoption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Income support, by providing cash transfers without targeting specific goods or services, avoids distortions in market prices and resource allocation.  Price subsidies and DBT, on the other hand, can lead to market distortions due to price manipulation and artificial demand.  This makes income support a more market-friendly approach to poverty alleviation.

Statement 2 is also correct. The decision to phase out kerosene subsidies is largely based on the declining usage patterns of kerosene, primarily due to improvements in electricity access (through programs like Saubhagya) and the growing adoption of LPG as a cleaner cooking fuel (through programs like Ujjwala). The reduction in kerosene consumption reduces the need for subsidies and allows for reallocation of resources to other welfare programs.  The success of these programs has contributed to the feasibility of phasing out kerosene subsidies.


**1. With reference to the concept of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services across different countries, adjusting for differences in price levels.
2.  The use of PPP exchange rates often leads to a different ranking of countries' economies compared to rankings based on nominal exchange rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It aims to determine the relative value of currencies based on their purchasing power in each country, rather than relying solely on nominal exchange rates which can be volatile and influenced by speculation.  The calculation involves comparing the prices of the same set of goods and services in different countries, adjusting for differences in price levels to arrive at a more accurate comparison of purchasing power.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Because PPP takes into account the relative cost of living and price levels within each country, it often leads to a different ranking of national economies compared to rankings based on nominal exchange rates. A country might have a relatively low nominal GDP per capita due to a low nominal exchange rate, but a high PPP-adjusted GDP per capita if the cost of living is significantly lower in that country.  This is particularly relevant when comparing developed and developing economies.  For example, India's nominal GDP might rank lower than other countries, but its PPP-adjusted GDP might be significantly higher.


**2. With reference to the determinants of economic development, consider the following statements:**

1.  High savings rates alone guarantee significant increases in output and a higher standard of living.
2.  Increases in absolute and per capita real GNP are sufficient indicators of higher levels of economic development, irrespective of other socio-economic factors.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While high savings rates are crucial for capital formation and economic growth, they are not a guarantee of significant output increases or improved living standards.  The efficiency of capital utilization, technological advancements, and institutional factors (like governance and infrastructure) are equally important. High savings without productive investment can lead to a high capital-output ratio, diminishing returns, and ultimately, limited growth impact.  Furthermore, even with high savings, issues like inequality in income distribution can prevent widespread benefits from reaching the population.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Economic development is a multifaceted concept encompassing not just economic growth (measured by GNP), but also social progress, human development, environmental sustainability, and reduced inequality.  High GNP figures, even per capita, may mask underlying issues like high poverty rates, unemployment, and widening income disparities.  These social and economic indicators are essential for a complete picture of development, and their absence negates the claim that simply increased GNP signifies genuine economic development.  Therefore, solely relying on GNP figures, regardless of their magnitude, is an inadequate measure of true economic development.


**3. With reference to the Indian economy's response to economic recession, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cutting tax rates while simultaneously increasing interest rates is a typical policy response during an economic recession.
2. Increasing government expenditure on public projects is a common fiscal policy tool used to stimulate demand during an economic downturn.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. During an economic recession, characterized by low aggregate demand and high unemployment, the typical policy response involves expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.  Cutting tax rates aims to stimulate demand by increasing disposable income, but simultaneously raising interest rates would counteract this effect. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, discouraging investment and consumption, thus dampening economic activity further.  The simultaneous application of contractionary monetary policy (higher interest rates) and expansionary fiscal policy (tax cuts) would create conflicting signals and potentially hinder recovery.

Statement 2 is correct. Increasing government expenditure on public projects is a key component of expansionary fiscal policy.  This increases aggregate demand directly through increased government spending and indirectly through the multiplier effect.  Public works projects create employment, boost related industries, and generally inject liquidity into the economy, stimulating demand and pulling the economy out of a recession.  This is a classic Keynesian approach to managing recessions.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy's monetary policy tools, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) leads to a decrease in the money multiplier and a contraction of money supply.
2. An increase in the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) directly reduces the amount of money available for lending by commercial banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) is the percentage of a bank's deposits that it is required to maintain with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the form of liquid cash.  An increase in CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, decreasing the money multiplier (the amount by which an initial deposit can expand the money supply through lending). A smaller money multiplier leads to a contraction of the overall money supply in the economy.  This is a contractionary monetary policy tool used to control inflation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) is the percentage of a bank's total deposits that it must maintain in the form of specified liquid assets, including government securities.  An increase in SLR directly reduces the funds available for lending by banks, as a larger portion of their deposits must be held in less productive assets.  This reduces the banks’ capacity to create credit, thus acting as a tool for controlling money supply and inflation.  Similar to CRR, an increase in SLR is a contractionary monetary policy measure.


**5. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The weight assigned to food items is typically higher in the CPI than in the WPI, reflecting the significant share of food expenditure in household budgets.
2. The WPI does not capture changes in the prices of services, whereas the CPI includes both goods and services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures changes in the price level of a basket of goods and services consumed by households.  A significant portion of household expenditure in India is on food, so food items typically receive a higher weight in the CPI calculation compared to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).  The WPI, on the other hand, focuses on prices at the wholesale level and may give less emphasis to food items relative to other goods traded in bulk.

Statement 2 is correct.  The WPI primarily tracks price changes of goods at the wholesale stage, before they reach consumers.  It traditionally excludes services, focusing largely on the industrial and agricultural sectors.  The CPI, however, incorporates prices of both goods and services consumed by households, offering a broader measure of inflation that reflects the overall cost of living.  This difference in scope is a key distinction between the two indices, making the CPI a more comprehensive indicator of consumer inflation.


**6. With reference to the Indian economy's exchange rate system, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates an appreciation of the Indian rupee against a basket of other currencies.
2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) signifies an improvement in India's trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is an index that measures the value of a currency against a weighted average of other currencies.  An increase in NEER indicates that the rupee has appreciated—it can now buy more units of foreign currencies.  This means that imports become cheaper and exports become more expensive, potentially impacting the trade balance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) adjusts the NEER for differences in price levels between countries. An increase in REER does not necessarily mean an improvement in trade competitiveness. While a decrease in REER would generally improve competitiveness (making exports cheaper and imports more expensive), an increase in REER suggests a loss of competitiveness, as domestic goods become relatively more expensive compared to foreign goods.  Other factors like productivity, technology, and global demand also significantly influence a country's trade competitiveness.  Therefore, simply interpreting REER increase as an improvement in trade competitiveness is misleading.


**7. With reference to India's Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs), consider the following statements:**

1. IIBs offer investors protection against inflation risk by adjusting the principal and/or interest payments based on inflation.
2. The interest income earned on IIBs is fully taxable, similar to other government bonds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from inflation risk. Unlike conventional bonds where the return is fixed regardless of inflation, IIBs adjust the principal and/or interest payments in line with changes in a specified inflation index (like the CPI).  This ensures that the real value of the investment is maintained even if the general price level rises.  This feature makes IIBs attractive to risk-averse investors concerned about the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the tax treatment of IIBs can vary depending on the specific scheme and the country's tax laws,  the interest income earned on IIBs is generally not fully taxable in the same way as other government bonds.  Often, there are specific tax provisions related to the inflation adjustment component, making the tax burden less than on conventional bonds with similar nominal yields.  Therefore, a blanket statement that interest income is fully taxable is inaccurate.


**8. With reference to the impact of US Federal Reserve's monetary policy on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (like raising interest rates) can lead to capital flight from India.
2. A devaluation of the Indian rupee increases the currency risk associated with External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) for Indian firms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The US Federal Reserve's monetary policy significantly influences global capital flows. A tight monetary policy, usually involving interest rate hikes, makes US dollar-denominated assets more attractive to international investors. This can lead to capital flight from emerging markets like India, as investors seek higher returns in US assets.  Capital outflow puts downward pressure on the rupee and may impact the country's financial stability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A devaluation of the Indian rupee actually *decreases* the currency risk associated with External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) for Indian firms.  ECBs are loans taken by Indian companies in foreign currencies (typically USD).  If the rupee depreciates, the repayment burden in rupee terms decreases.  While fluctuations in exchange rates always pose some risk, devaluation reduces the risk for borrowers who have taken out ECBs.  Appreciation, on the other hand, would increase the rupee cost of repayment, raising the currency risk.


**9.  With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Because convertible bonds offer the option to convert into equity, they typically pay a lower coupon rate compared to comparable non-convertible bonds.
2.  The conversion option in convertible bonds provides the bondholder with some protection against inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Convertible bonds offer the holder the right to convert the bond into a predetermined number of equity shares of the issuing company at a specified price.  This option adds value to the bond, allowing the issuer to offer a lower coupon (interest) rate.  Investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate because they have the potential to benefit from equity appreciation if the company's stock price rises.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While convertible bonds offer some potential upside if the company performs well, they do not inherently provide protection against inflation. The conversion feature does not automatically adjust for inflation.  The value of the equity shares received upon conversion will be subject to market forces and inflation, which could either increase or decrease the real value of the investment.  Therefore, relying on convertible bonds as an inflation hedge is not accurate.  Other instruments, like inflation-indexed bonds, are specifically designed to mitigate inflation risk.


**10. With reference to the factors contributing to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. Expansionary monetary policies, such as lowering interest rates, can contribute to demand-pull inflation.
2. Inflation-indexing wages, where wages are adjusted to reflect inflation, directly fuels demand-pull inflation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand in an economy outstrips aggregate supply, leading to a general rise in prices.  Expansionary monetary policies, such as reducing interest rates, increase the money supply and make borrowing cheaper.  This stimulates investment and consumption, boosting aggregate demand and potentially leading to demand-pull inflation if the increase in demand exceeds the economy's capacity to produce.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While inflation-indexing wages protects workers' purchasing power from the effects of inflation, it does not directly *cause* demand-pull inflation.  Inflation-indexing wages merely adjusts wages to keep pace with price increases.  It does not create excess demand in itself.  Demand-pull inflation arises from factors that increase overall demand beyond the economy's productive capacity, such as expansionary monetary or fiscal policies, increased consumer confidence, or external shocks.  Therefore, attributing demand-pull inflation solely to inflation-indexed wages is inaccurate.  Inflation-indexing wages is a response to inflation, not a cause of demand-pull inflation.


**1. With reference to the determinants of India's economic development, consider the following statements:**

1.  A high saving economy does not guarantee significant output increase if the capital-output ratio remains high.
2.  Rapid industrial output growth, without commensurate agricultural output growth, may not necessarily signify higher economic development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A high savings rate is a necessary but not sufficient condition for economic growth.  A high capital-output ratio indicates that a large amount of capital investment is required to generate a unit of output. This implies inefficiency in capital utilization, technological backwardness, or other structural bottlenecks.  Therefore, even with high savings, if the capital-output ratio remains high, the resulting increase in output may be insignificant.  This reflects a lack of productivity gains from investment.

Statement 2 is also correct. While industrial growth is crucial for economic development, neglecting the agricultural sector can hinder overall progress.  Agricultural output constitutes a significant portion of GDP in many developing economies, including India. If industrial growth outpaces agricultural growth, it could lead to imbalances in the economy, such as rural-urban migration without sufficient job creation in urban areas, food insecurity, and inflationary pressures.  Balanced growth across sectors is essential for sustainable and inclusive economic development.  Focusing solely on industrial output might lead to skewed development, neglecting the needs of a large segment of the population dependent on agriculture.


**2. With reference to the impact of economic policies on inflation, consider the following statements:**

1. Expansionary fiscal policies and increased purchasing power directly contribute to demand-pull inflation.
2. Inflation-indexing wages and rising interest rates mitigate demand-pull inflationary pressures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Expansionary fiscal policies, such as increased government spending or tax cuts, inject more money into the economy, increasing aggregate demand.  Simultaneously, higher purchasing power, resulting from factors like increased wages or reduced unemployment, also boosts aggregate demand.  When aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, prices rise, leading to demand-pull inflation.  This is a classic Keynesian explanation of inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Inflation-indexing wages, while seemingly counterintuitive, can actually exacerbate inflation. If wages are automatically adjusted to reflect the current inflation rate, this increases costs for businesses, which they may pass on to consumers in the form of higher prices, creating a wage-price spiral.  Rising interest rates, on the other hand, are typically used as a *contractionary* monetary policy tool to curb inflation.  By increasing borrowing costs, higher interest rates reduce investment and consumption, thereby lowering aggregate demand and inflationary pressure. However, rising interest rates can also negatively impact economic growth.


**3. With reference to the functioning of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's buying of government securities is a measure to increase money supply and combat deflationary pressures.
2.  The RBI's selling of dollars in the foreign exchange market is a measure to appreciate the Indian Rupee and curb inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. When the RBI buys government securities, it injects liquidity into the banking system. This increases the money supply, making credit cheaper and more readily available.  This stimulates economic activity and can help counter deflationary pressures (falling prices). This is a form of expansionary monetary policy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  When the RBI sells dollars in the foreign exchange market, it increases the demand for the Indian Rupee. Increased demand for the Rupee leads to its appreciation (increase in value) against the dollar.  A stronger Rupee makes imports cheaper and can help curb inflationary pressures caused by rising import prices. This is a form of intervention in the foreign exchange market to manage the exchange rate and control inflation.


**4. With reference to India's financial instruments, consider the following statements:**

1.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) protect investors from inflation risk by adjusting returns based on inflation rates, but they may have lower coupon rates than conventional bonds.
2.  Convertible Bonds offer a lower interest rate due to the option of converting them into equity, providing a degree of indexation to rising consumer prices, but the interest and capital gains are taxable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation. The principal and interest payments on IIBs are adjusted periodically based on a pre-defined inflation index. This feature makes them attractive to risk-averse investors concerned about inflation.  However, because of this inflation protection, IIBs typically offer lower coupon rates (interest payments) compared to conventional bonds.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While it is true that convertible bonds often offer lower interest rates than comparable non-convertible bonds due to the embedded option to convert into equity, this option does not directly provide indexation to rising consumer prices in the same way IIBs do.  The value of the equity received upon conversion will fluctuate with market conditions, which may or may not reflect inflation.  Additionally, the statement incorrectly claims that the interest and capital gains on convertible bonds are taxable; the tax implications vary depending on the specific bond and the investor's tax jurisdiction.


**5. With reference to the impact of global financial events on India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve can lead to capital flight from India, increasing the interest costs for firms with External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).
2.  Devaluation of the Indian Rupee increases the currency risk associated with ECBs for Indian firms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (like raising interest rates) typically leads to higher interest rates globally.  This makes investments in countries like India (with potentially lower returns) less attractive to foreign investors. Consequently, foreign investors may withdraw their investments from India, leading to capital flight. This outflow of capital can increase the interest costs for Indian firms that have taken out External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) denominated in foreign currencies, as the repayment burden becomes higher due to currency fluctuations and increased interest rates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Devaluation of the Indian Rupee *reduces* the currency risk associated with ECBs for Indian firms. If a firm has borrowed in a foreign currency (like USD) and the Rupee depreciates, the amount of Rupees required to repay the loan decreases, reducing the effective cost of the borrowing. Conversely, an appreciation of the Rupee increases the effective cost of repaying the loan.  Therefore, devaluation actually helps reduce the currency risk for borrowers.


**6. With reference to the characteristics of money, consider the following statements:**

1. Money serves as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions without the need for a double coincidence of wants.
2.  Money acts as a perfect store of value, maintaining its purchasing power irrespective of inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The primary function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange.  In a barter system, two parties must have a "double coincidence of wants"—each must desire what the other possesses—for a transaction to occur.  Money eliminates this requirement by providing a universally accepted medium of exchange.  This significantly simplifies and facilitates economic transactions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While money serves as a store of value, it is not a *perfect* store of value.  During periods of inflation, the purchasing power of money erodes.  This means that the same amount of money will buy fewer goods and services over time.  The rate of inflation directly impacts the effectiveness of money as a store of value.  Other assets, such as gold or real estate, are sometimes considered better stores of value during inflationary periods, although they carry different risks and may be less liquid.


**7. Consider the following statements concerning India's financial inclusion initiatives:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana primarily aims at providing loans to small and marginal farmers for specific crops.
2. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) plays a significant role in promoting financial inclusion through initiatives like RuPay.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) is a scheme aimed at promoting entrepreneurship among small businesses and micro-units.  While it might indirectly benefit some farmers who engage in small-scale enterprises, its primary focus is not on providing loans to farmers for specific crops.  Other schemes specifically target agricultural credit needs.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) plays a crucial role in promoting financial inclusion in India.  It facilitates the development and implementation of various payment systems, including the RuPay card payment scheme.  RuPay aims to provide access to affordable and convenient payment solutions to a wider population, including those previously excluded from formal financial services.  By expanding access to digital payment systems, NPCI helps to bridge the financial inclusion gap.


**8. With reference to India's balance of payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. A current account deficit necessarily implies a net capital outflow from the country.
2.  The overall balance of payments (including official reserve transactions) must always equal zero.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A current account deficit does *not* necessarily imply a net capital outflow.  A current account deficit means that a country is importing more goods and services than it is exporting. To finance this deficit, the country needs to attract capital inflows. These inflows could be in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign portfolio investment (FPI), or borrowing from abroad.  The capital account reflects these inflows and outflows.  A current account deficit is typically financed by a net capital inflow, not outflow.

Statement 2 is correct. The balance of payments (BoP) is a double-entry accounting system. Every transaction involves both a debit (payment) and a credit (receipt).  The BoP accounts for all international transactions, including trade in goods and services (current account), capital flows (capital account), and changes in official reserves (official reserve transactions).  Therefore, the sum of all these accounts must always equal zero. Any surplus in one account is balanced by a deficit in another, or by a change in official reserves.  This ensures that the BoP always balances.


**1. With reference to the concept of Inclusive Growth, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth necessitates high national income growth as a primary condition for poverty reduction and balanced regional development.
2.  Inclusive growth strategies prioritize productive employment and skill development over direct income redistribution as a long-term solution for poverty alleviation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While high national income growth is a positive factor, inclusive growth emphasizes that it's insufficient on its own.  The benefits of growth must be equitably distributed across all sections of society, including those in rural areas, women, and marginalized communities.  High GDP growth without addressing issues of inequality and exclusion does not constitute inclusive growth. The focus must be on broad-based growth, not just high aggregate growth.

Statement 2 is correct. Inclusive growth strategies prioritize sustainable, long-term solutions, focusing on creating productive employment opportunities and enhancing human capital through skill development.  While short-term income redistribution schemes might be used to mitigate immediate hardship, they are not considered a sustainable solution for poverty reduction in the long run. The emphasis is on empowering individuals to participate in and benefit from economic growth through productive activities. This aligns with the concept of enabling "equality of opportunity" and "participation in growth by all" as core elements of inclusive growth.  Direct income redistribution can be problematic due to budgetary constraints and its inherent limitations in addressing the root causes of poverty.


**2. With reference to the measurement of poverty in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tendulkar Committee's poverty estimates used a consumption expenditure-based methodology, setting lower daily expenditure thresholds than the subsequent Rangarajan Committee.
2.  The Rangarajan Committee's poverty line, based on higher daily expenditure thresholds than the Tendulkar Committee, resulted in a significantly lower poverty rate for 2011-12.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Tendulkar Committee, appointed by the Planning Commission, employed a consumption expenditure methodology to estimate poverty.  It indeed proposed lower daily expenditure thresholds for both rural and urban areas compared to the subsequent Rangarajan Committee.  This difference in methodology and thresholds led to a significant variation in the estimated poverty rates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rangarajan Committee, tasked with reviewing the poverty estimation methodology, raised the daily expenditure thresholds significantly.  This resulted in a *higher*, not lower, poverty rate for 2011-12 compared to the Tendulkar Committee's estimates. The higher thresholds reflected a revised understanding of the minimum consumption requirements to escape poverty.  The discrepancy highlights the ongoing debate and challenges in accurately measuring poverty in India, influenced by factors like inflation, changing consumption patterns, and the complexity of defining a poverty line.


**3. With reference to India's economic reforms post-1991, consider the following statements:**

1. The reforms led to a consistent increase in the growth rate of all major sectors (agriculture, industry, and services) of the Indian economy.
2.  Post-reform economic growth in India has been primarily driven by the service sector, while agricultural growth has decelerated.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the overall GDP growth rate increased after the 1991 reforms, this growth wasn't uniform across all sectors.  While the service sector experienced significant expansion, the growth rate of the agricultural sector decelerated. The industrial sector also showed some fluctuations, not a consistent increase. The uneven growth highlights the structural challenges within the Indian economy, including the continued dependence on agriculture despite its declining contribution to GDP and the need for a more balanced and diversified economic structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The post-1991 reforms led to a substantial increase in the service sector's contribution to India's GDP.  This sector's growth, fueled by technological advancements and globalization, became a key driver of the overall economic expansion.  Conversely, the agricultural sector's growth rate slowed down, partly due to reduced public investment in infrastructure and the impact of liberalization policies on small and marginal farmers.  This uneven sectoral growth underscores the need for policy interventions to address the challenges faced by the agricultural sector and ensure more inclusive and sustainable economic development.



**4. With reference to the concept of human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Investment in education is the sole primary source for human capital formation; other factors such as health and on-the-job training play a secondary role.
2. Migration, both internal (rural-urban) and international, contributes to human capital formation by enabling individuals to acquire higher-paying jobs and enhance their skills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Human capital formation is a multifaceted process, not solely dependent on education.  While education is a crucial component, investments in health, on-the-job training, and access to information also significantly contribute to the development of human capital.  A healthy workforce is more productive, and on-the-job training enhances skills and productivity within specific sectors.  Therefore, a holistic approach considering multiple factors is essential for effective human capital formation.

Statement 2 is correct. Migration, whether internal or international, plays a significant role in human capital formation. Individuals migrating in search of better job opportunities often gain valuable skills and experience, leading to enhanced earning potential and personal development.  While migration involves costs (such as relocation expenses), the potential gains in income and skill acquisition often outweigh these costs, contributing positively to human capital formation at both individual and national levels. The increased earning capacity of migrants often benefits sending regions through remittances and the acquired skills can also be transferred back.


**5.  With reference to the calculation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The product method of calculating GDP sums the final value of all goods and services produced in the economy, irrespective of whether they are consumed domestically or exported.
2. The income method of GDP calculation aggregates all factor incomes (wages, profits, rent, interest) earned within the country's borders, regardless of the nationality of the factor owners.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The product method, also known as the value-added method, calculates GDP by summing the final value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period.  This includes both goods and services consumed domestically and those exported to other countries.  The key is to avoid double-counting by only considering the final value of goods and services, not intermediate goods used in production.

Statement 2 is correct.  The income method calculates GDP by summing all factor incomes earned within a country's borders.  This includes wages, salaries, profits, rents, and interest payments earned by both domestic and foreign factor owners.  The income method is based on the principle that the total value of output produced must equal the total income earned in the production process.  Therefore, it sums up all the incomes generated from production activities within the country's geographical boundaries.  The distinction between GDP and GNP arises when considering factor incomes earned by domestic factors abroad and factor incomes earned by foreign factors within the country.




Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding poverty alleviation in India:**

1.  The growth-oriented approach, dominant in the 1950s and early 1960s, primarily focused on rapid industrial development and agricultural transformation through the Green Revolution, expecting benefits to trickle down to the poor.
2.  The third approach to poverty alleviation, emerging from the Fifth Five Year Plan, emphasized providing minimum basic amenities like subsidized food grains, education, and healthcare, to supplement the consumption of the poor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the initial growth-oriented approach to poverty reduction in India.  The focus was on overall economic growth, assuming that its benefits would automatically reach the poor.  The Green Revolution, while increasing food production, also exacerbated inequalities.  Statement 2 correctly reflects the later strategy of providing minimum basic amenities as a direct intervention to improve the living standards of the poor. This approach recognized that economic growth alone wasn't sufficient to alleviate poverty. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements represent distinct, yet historically accurate, phases in India's approach to poverty alleviation.


**2. With reference to the identification of poor people in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Pre-independence India saw Dadabhai Naoroji's pioneering work in defining a Poverty Line, using the cost of living for prisoners as a basis, later adjusted for children.
2.  Scholars identify the poor based solely on income levels, using a fixed poverty line to categorize individuals and households.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Dadabhai Naoroji's contribution to the concept of a poverty line in pre-independent India. His methodology, using a "jail cost of living" as a starting point and adjusting for children, was innovative for its time.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While income is a crucial factor, identifying the poor is a multi-dimensional process that considers factors beyond just income levels. Occupation, asset ownership, access to resources, vulnerability to risks, and social indicators are also crucial.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only Statement 1 presents a historically accurate and relevant approach to poverty line estimation in the context of India.


**3. With reference to India's economic reforms of 1991 (LPG Reforms), consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms aimed at dismantling quantitative restrictions on imports and exports, reducing tariff rates, and removing licensing procedures for imports to enhance international competitiveness.
2.  The reforms completely abolished industrial licensing across all sectors, leading to immediate and widespread deregulation of the industrial sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a major objective of the 1991 reforms: to liberalize trade and investment to boost international competitiveness.  The dismantling of quantitative restrictions, tariff reductions, and import licensing deregulation were key components of this strategy. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the reforms significantly reduced industrial licensing, they did *not* abolish it completely across all sectors.  Certain industries, like defense and atomic energy, remained under strict government control.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only Statement 1 accurately captures a key aspect of the 1991 reforms' impact on trade and industry.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the characteristics of inclusive growth:**

1.  Inclusive growth solely focuses on accelerating poverty reduction through direct income redistribution schemes to ensure equitable distribution of wealth.
2.  The World Bank's definition of inclusive growth emphasizes sustained, broad-based growth across sectors, including a significant portion of the country's workforce, with a focus on productive employment and equality of opportunity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Inclusive growth is not solely about income redistribution. While equity is a component, the focus is broader, encompassing productive employment, access to resources, and opportunities for participation in economic growth.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the World Bank's perspective on inclusive growth, highlighting its emphasis on sustained, broad-based growth, inclusion of the workforce, productive employment, and equal opportunities. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only Statement 2 aligns with the established understanding of inclusive growth as articulated by organizations like the World Bank.


**5. With reference to the challenges faced by the Indian economy in the pre-1991 era, consider the following statements:**

1.  The License Raj, characterized by complex regulations and bureaucratic hurdles, stifled competition, entrepreneurship, and growth, hindering the achievement of its stated social objectives.
2.  The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act of 1969, while intended to curb monopolies, inadvertently hampered the expansion of even large and efficient businesses, limiting economies of scale.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe significant challenges faced by the Indian economy before 1991. The License Raj, with its intricate licensing system, created inefficiencies and discouraged new entrepreneurs.  The MRTP Act, despite its intentions, inadvertently stifled the growth of large businesses, preventing them from achieving economies of scale and hindering overall economic development.  All other options are incorrect as both statements correctly identify and explain two major structural bottlenecks of the Indian economy prior to the 1991 reforms.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding human capital formation in India:**

1. Investment in education is the sole determinant of human capital formation, with other factors playing a negligible role.
2. Investments in health, on-the-job training, and migration contribute significantly to human capital formation alongside education.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While education is a crucial component, human capital formation is a multifaceted process influenced by various factors.  Health, skills development through on-the-job training, and migration (in search of better opportunities) all significantly contribute to enhancing human capabilities and productivity.  Statement 2 correctly identifies these additional factors as essential contributors to human capital formation. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only Statement 2 accurately reflects the holistic nature of human capital formation.


**7. With reference to rural development in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rural development initiatives solely focus on agricultural activities, neglecting the importance of non-agricultural sectors and diversification.
2.  Improving rural infrastructure, such as banking, communication, and transportation, is crucial for realizing the full potential of rural areas and promoting sustainable livelihoods.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A comprehensive approach to rural development goes beyond agriculture, acknowledging the significance of non-agricultural sectors like livestock, fisheries, and small-scale industries. Diversification is key to reducing dependence on agriculture and creating more sustainable livelihoods.  Statement 2 correctly highlights the importance of infrastructure development in rural areas.  Improved infrastructure enhances connectivity, market access, and overall development. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only Statement 2 accurately represents a key aspect of successful rural development strategies.


**8. Consider the following statements about India's economic growth and poverty:**

1.  The decline in poverty during Indira Gandhi's tenure was primarily due to extensive anti-poverty programs implemented during that period.
2.  The faster growth of agricultural production due to the Green Revolution in the mid-1960s significantly contributed to poverty reduction, despite slower overall economic growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Indira Gandhi's government did implement several poverty reduction schemes, the significant decline in poverty during that period was largely attributed to the Green Revolution's impact on agricultural production. The programs' effects took longer to show. Statement 2 correctly points out that the Green Revolution's positive impact on agricultural output, even with slower overall economic growth, played a major role in poverty reduction, particularly in rural areas. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only Statement 2 accurately identifies the primary driver of poverty reduction in the mid-1960s.


**9. With reference to the functions of money in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money primarily serves as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions and eliminating the need for barter systems.
2.  Money's role as a store of value is absolute and unchallenged, making it the only reliable asset for preserving wealth over time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the primary function of money: to serve as a medium of exchange, simplifying transactions and overcoming the limitations of barter systems.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While money serves as a store of value, it is not the only asset with this function. Other assets, such as gold, real estate, and stocks, can also store value, although with varying degrees of liquidity and risk. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only Statement 1 accurately describes a fundamental economic function of money.  The other functions (unit of account and store of value) are also important, but the medium of exchange is the most fundamental.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of India's economic liberalization:**

1.  The liberalization process uniformly benefited all sections of society, leading to a significant reduction in economic inequality.
2.  While liberalization led to high economic growth, it also resulted in the exclusion of many marginalized groups, widening existing social and economic disparities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's economic liberalization, while boosting overall growth, did not uniformly benefit all sections of society.  Significant disparities persisted, and even widened in some cases, between different social groups and geographical regions.  Statement 2 correctly points out this uneven distribution of benefits, highlighting the exclusion of marginalized groups and the persistence of inequality despite high economic growth. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only Statement 2 accurately captures the complexities and challenges associated with India's economic liberalization process.


**1. With reference to India's economic development, consider the following statements:**

1.  The five-year plan pattern of development was consistently followed by India, Pakistan, and China in their respective developmental paths.
2.  The majority of the workforce in India, China, and Pakistan remained dependent on agriculture, with varying degrees of dependency across these countries.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India and Pakistan initially adopted five-year plans, China's developmental path deviated significantly, particularly after its economic reforms in 1978.  China's approach emphasized a more market-oriented strategy, unlike the centrally planned approach of India's early five-year plans and Pakistan's similar initiatives.  The assertion of a consistent pattern across all three nations is therefore false.  The developmental strategies varied considerably in their implementation and outcomes.

Statement 2 is correct.  Across India, China, and Pakistan, a substantial portion of the workforce remained tied to the agricultural sector, even during periods of industrialization and economic growth.  While the degree of agricultural dependence varied – China experienced significant shifts toward industrialization and urbanization – agriculture continued to play a major role in providing livelihoods for a large part of the population in all three countries. This highlights the persistent challenges of structural transformation and the slow pace of diversification in these economies.  The significant reliance on agriculture, especially in India and Pakistan, also contributed to issues like high population density in rural areas and limited employment opportunities outside of agriculture.


**2. With reference to India's developmental indicators, consider the following statements:**

1.  High capital-output ratios and high rates of population growth were major contributors to the slow growth of per capita income in India.
2.  High rates of capital formation and high levels of fiscal deficits were the primary drivers of India's rapid economic growth in recent decades.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  High capital-output ratios imply that a large amount of investment is required to generate a unit of output, hindering per capita income growth.  Coupled with a high rate of population growth, the overall increase in national income is absorbed by the growing population, leaving limited per capita gains. This highlights the need for efficient resource allocation and investments in human capital to improve productivity.  The slow growth of per capita income reflects the challenges of balancing economic growth with population dynamics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While high rates of capital formation are essential for economic growth, they do not automatically translate into significant output increases without complementary factors like efficient resource allocation, technological advancements, and skilled labor.  Moreover, high levels of fiscal deficits are generally detrimental to long-term economic health, often leading to inflationary pressures and crowding out of private investment.  While fiscal deficits might temporarily stimulate demand, their unsustainable nature can impede sustainable economic growth.  India's recent economic growth has been driven by a complex interplay of factors, and attributing it solely to high capital formation and fiscal deficits is an oversimplification.


**3. With reference to the concept of human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Investments in education and health are primary sources of human capital formation, while migration and information acquisition play only a minor role.
2.  The formation of human capital is directly linked to a nation's economic growth but has minimal impact on overall human development.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While investments in education and health are indeed crucial for human capital formation, migration and information acquisition also play significant roles. Migration can lead to increased earnings and skill development, contributing to human capital accumulation.  Similarly, access to information about labor markets and educational opportunities allows individuals to make informed decisions about their investments in human capital, optimizing their returns.  Ignoring these factors presents an incomplete understanding of human capital dynamics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Human capital formation is intrinsically linked to both economic growth and overall human development.  A skilled and healthy workforce enhances productivity, leading to economic growth.  Simultaneously, it contributes to improved living standards, social mobility, and overall well-being, encompassing various dimensions of human development.  The two are intertwined and mutually reinforcing; neglecting this interdependency leads to an incomplete and potentially misleading assessment of development progress.


**4. With reference to poverty in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The poverty line in India is consistently defined using a fixed minimum consumption expenditure, irrespective of regional variations in the cost of living.
2.  The identification of the poor relies solely on their occupation and ownership of assets, neglecting other dimensions of poverty such as access to healthcare and education.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The definition and estimation of the poverty line in India have evolved over time, with various committees and expert groups adjusting methodologies to account for regional variations in cost of living and changing consumption patterns.  A fixed, uniform poverty line would fail to accurately reflect the diverse realities across different regions of India.  The adjustments made by different committees reflect attempts to refine the poverty line estimations to achieve a more realistic assessment of poverty levels.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While occupation and asset ownership are important indicators of poverty, they do not encompass the multidimensional nature of poverty.  Factors like access to healthcare, education, sanitation, and social security are equally crucial in determining a household's well-being and vulnerability.  A comprehensive assessment of poverty requires considering a range of indicators beyond simple economic measures.  The various dimensions of poverty highlight the need for a holistic approach to poverty alleviation programs.


**5. With reference to India’s economic reforms since 1991, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms led to a significant increase in the share of agriculture in GDP, demonstrating their success in boosting the agricultural sector.
2.  The reforms resulted in a substantial increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and foreign exchange reserves.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 1991 reforms aimed to liberalize the economy, the share of agriculture in India's GDP has actually *decreased* since then, reflecting a shift towards the services sector.  The reforms did not lead to a substantial improvement in the agricultural sector's contribution to GDP. This highlights the challenges of reforming the agricultural sector and the need for targeted interventions to boost productivity and income in this crucial sector.

Statement 2 is correct.  A major outcome of the 1991 reforms was a substantial increase in FDI inflows and foreign exchange reserves. The opening up of the Indian economy to foreign investment attracted significant capital flows, strengthening India's external sector.  This demonstrates the success of the reforms in attracting foreign investment and building up the nation's foreign exchange reserves, enhancing its economic resilience.


**6. With reference to inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Inclusive growth strategies primarily focus on income redistribution schemes as the most effective way to alleviate poverty in the long term.
2.  The concept of inclusive growth emphasizes the need for broad-based growth across sectors, including agriculture, and ensuring that the benefits reach all sections of society.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While income redistribution can play a role in addressing immediate poverty, inclusive growth strategies emphasize a longer-term perspective focused on creating productive employment opportunities and enhancing the capabilities of marginalized groups.  Relying solely on redistribution is often unsustainable and may not address the root causes of poverty.  Sustainable poverty reduction requires creating opportunities for participation in the growth process, not just distributing existing resources.

Statement 2 is correct. Inclusive growth aims to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared broadly across all segments of society, not just a select few.  This involves fostering growth in sectors where the poor are employed, such as agriculture, and addressing regional disparities.  The emphasis on broad-based growth and equitable distribution of the benefits is central to the concept of inclusive growth.  This requires a multi-pronged approach, addressing issues like access to resources, education, healthcare, and infrastructure.


**7. With reference to the challenges to inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  High levels of poverty, characterized by lack of education and skills, are a major constraint to inclusive growth.
2.  Regional disparities in development, with some regions faring better than others, are not a significant concern for inclusive growth.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  High levels of poverty, particularly among those lacking education and skills, are a significant barrier to inclusive growth.  The lack of skills limits employment opportunities and productivity, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and hindering the participation of marginalized groups in the growth process.  Addressing this requires investments in education, skill development, and job creation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Regional disparities, with significant variations in development levels across different regions, are a major concern for inclusive growth.  These disparities can exacerbate inequalities, limit social mobility, and hinder the overall progress of the nation.  Addressing regional disparities requires targeted interventions, focusing on infrastructure development, skill-building, and investment in lagging regions.  Ignoring regional disparities undermines the goal of inclusive growth.


**8. With reference to NITI Aayog and its role in India's economic development, consider the following statements:**

1.  NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, shifting from a top-down planning approach to a more bottom-up approach, emphasizing greater state participation.
2.  NITI Aayog's primary focus is on allocating funds to ministries and states, similar to the Planning Commission's role.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NITI Aayog was established to replace the Planning Commission, signifying a shift from a centrally planned economy to a more cooperative federalist model.  NITI Aayog's bottom-up approach encourages greater state participation in policy formulation and implementation.  This reflects a change in the governance structure, promoting greater collaboration between the central government and the states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Planning Commission had a significant role in allocating funds, NITI Aayog's primary function is not fund allocation.  The allocation of funds is primarily the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.  NITI Aayog's focus is on policy formulation, strategic planning, and monitoring the implementation of development programs.  The shift in focus reflects a change in the government's approach to economic planning and management.


**9. With reference to the challenges faced by India's manufacturing sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India's manufacturing sector is highly competitive in low-skilled manufacturing, providing ample employment opportunities for its large unskilled workforce.
2.  The shrinking global demand for manufactured goods poses a significant challenge to India's efforts to boost its manufacturing sector.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's manufacturing sector faces challenges in low-skilled manufacturing, partly due to factors like higher labor costs compared to some other countries and infrastructural bottlenecks.  While India excels in certain segments of manufacturing, it is not highly competitive in low-skilled manufacturing, which is where a significant portion of its unskilled workforce could be employed.  This limits employment opportunities and hinders the sector's potential for inclusive growth.

Statement 2 is correct. The global demand for manufactured goods is indeed shrinking, relative to the overall growth of the global economy, posing a challenge to countries aiming to boost their manufacturing sectors.  This trend, driven by factors like automation and shifts in global value chains, necessitates a focus on high-value manufacturing, technological advancements, and skill development to maintain competitiveness.  The shrinking demand for manufactured goods underscores the need for strategic adjustments in India's manufacturing strategy.


**10. With reference to the comparison between India's and China's economic development strategies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both India and China adopted similar "bottom-up" approaches to economic reforms, starting with liberalization in the agricultural sector.
2.  China's economic reforms, initiated in 1978, focused on agricultural sector reforms before moving to industrial sector reforms, contributing to widespread distribution of gains.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India and China adopted significantly different approaches to economic reforms. China adopted a "bottom-up" approach, starting with agricultural reforms that directly benefited a large segment of the population, building consensus for further reforms.  India's reforms, initiated in 1991, focused more on industrial and service sector liberalization, initially neglecting significant agricultural reforms.  The contrasting approaches highlight the different contexts and strategies employed by the two countries.

Statement 2 is correct.  China's economic reforms began with significant agricultural sector reforms in 1978, dismantling the commune system and introducing the household responsibility system. This led to a substantial increase in farmers' incomes, creating a strong domestic market for manufactured goods and driving industrial growth.  The sequence of reforms and their impact on income distribution underscore the importance of considering the social and economic context when designing reform strategies.


**1. With reference to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services across different countries, adjusting for differences in price levels.
2.  Using PPP dollars, India's ranking among the world's largest economies is significantly higher than its ranking based on nominal GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It aims to determine the relative value of currencies by comparing the prices of identical goods and services in different countries, adjusting for differences in price levels.  A higher PPP value for a country's currency indicates a higher purchasing power within that country compared to others.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Nominal GDP uses current exchange rates to convert different countries' GDPs into a common currency (usually USD). However, PPP-adjusted GDP accounts for differences in purchasing power between countries. Since prices for goods and services are often lower in developing countries like India compared to developed nations, using PPP leads to a higher valuation of India's GDP and a consequently higher ranking in global economic comparisons. The difference arises because nominal exchange rates don't always reflect the true purchasing power of a currency.  Therefore, using PPP provides a more accurate reflection of a country's economic size and standard of living relative to others.


**2. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPI gives greater weight to food items compared to the WPI, reflecting the higher proportion of income spent on food by many Indian households.
2. The WPI excludes services, while the CPI includes them, making the CPI a broader measure of inflation that captures changes in the cost of living more comprehensively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The CPI (Consumer Price Index) and WPI (Wholesale Price Index) are both measures of inflation, but they differ in their scope and methodology.  A significant portion of household expenditure in India, particularly for lower-income groups, is allocated to food. Therefore, the CPI gives a greater weight to food items than the WPI, which focuses on wholesale prices of goods at the producer or distributor level.  This difference reflects the reality of household consumption patterns and the impact of food price changes on the cost of living for a large segment of the population.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The WPI primarily tracks prices of goods at the wholesale level, excluding services.  In contrast, the CPI considers a broader range of goods and services consumed by households, offering a more comprehensive view of inflation's impact on the overall cost of living.  The exclusion of services from the WPI limits its ability to fully reflect the inflationary pressures experienced by consumers, especially in a service-driven economy like India’s, which has seen a significant growth in the services sector in recent decades.


**3. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements concerning capital formation:**

1. High savings rates alone guarantee significant increases in output and economic growth.
2. A high capital-output ratio can hinder the effectiveness of capital formation in boosting economic output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While high savings rates are crucial for capital formation, they do not automatically translate into significant increases in output.  Several factors can influence the effectiveness of capital formation in driving economic growth. These include the efficiency of investment allocation, technological advancements, the quality of human capital, and institutional frameworks.  Simply having high savings doesn't guarantee that these investments will be productive and lead to substantial output growth. For instance, if investments are misallocated or if the technology used is outdated, the impact on output might be minimal despite high savings.

Statement 2 is correct. A high capital-output ratio signifies that a large amount of capital investment is required to generate a unit of output. This implies that the economy is not efficiently utilizing its capital resources. Several factors may contribute to a high capital-output ratio including technological inefficiencies, poor infrastructure, inadequate skills among workers and managerial shortcomings. A high capital-output ratio suggests that even with increased capital formation, the resultant increase in output might be relatively small, dampening the overall impact on economic growth.


**4. With reference to India's Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in NEER indicates an appreciation of the Indian rupee against a basket of other currencies.
2. An increase in REER indicates improved trade competitiveness for Indian exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is an index that measures the value of a country's currency against a weighted average of other major currencies. An increase in NEER indicates that the domestic currency (in this case, the Indian Rupee) has appreciated relative to the basket of other currencies.  This means it takes fewer rupees to buy one unit of foreign currency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) adjusts the NEER for differences in inflation rates between countries. An increase in REER implies that the domestic currency has become more expensive relative to other currencies, considering inflation.  This makes domestic exports less competitive in the global market as they become relatively more expensive for foreign buyers. Therefore, an increase in REER would signal a deterioration, not an improvement, in trade competitiveness for Indian exports.


**5. With reference to market demand for a good, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the price of a substitute good will increase the market demand for the original good.
2. An increase in the price of a complementary good will decrease the market demand for the original good.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of another. If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper original good, thereby increasing the demand for it.  This is a fundamental principle of demand and supply.

Statement 2 is also correct. Complementary goods are those that are consumed together. If the price of a complementary good increases, the demand for the original good will fall because consumers will reduce their consumption of both goods simultaneously due to the higher overall cost.  The reduced consumption of the complementary good directly impacts the demand for the original good since they are used together.  For example, if the price of petrol increases (complementary to cars), the demand for cars may decline.


**6. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements regarding measures to curb a slide in the Indian Rupee:**

1.  Restricting imports of non-essential goods and simultaneously promoting exports is a viable strategy to improve the trade balance and support the Rupee.
2. Implementing an expansionary monetary policy will strengthen the Rupee by increasing money supply and lowering interest rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A weakening Rupee is often linked to a trade deficit (imports exceeding exports).  Curbing imports of non-essential items reduces the demand for foreign currency, thereby supporting the Rupee. Simultaneously boosting exports increases the supply of foreign currency, further strengthening the Rupee. This is a standard policy response to a depreciating currency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy involves increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity. However, this approach usually weakens a currency because lower interest rates make the currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns.  A weaker currency can lead to increased inflation as import prices rise. Therefore, an expansionary monetary policy is generally not used to counter a depreciating currency; rather, a contractionary policy is implemented.


**7. With reference to the money multiplier in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) will lead to a decrease in the money multiplier.
2. An increase in the banking habit of the population will lead to an increase in the money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The money multiplier is the amount by which an initial deposit in a bank can expand the overall money supply. The CRR is the percentage of deposits that banks are required to hold in reserve.  A higher CRR means banks have less money to lend, leading to a smaller money multiplier effect.  If banks are required to hold a larger proportion of their deposits as reserves, they have less available to lend, thus reducing the expansionary effect on the money supply.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The money multiplier is influenced by the extent to which people deposit their money in banks.  If more people deposit their money in banks (increased banking habit), banks have more funds available to lend, resulting in a larger money multiplier.  A higher propensity for individuals to deposit their funds in banks allows banks to create more credit and increase the money supply through lending activities.


**8. With reference to Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements about their purpose:**

1. SFBs aim to provide credit to small business units, thereby contributing to the growth of the MSME sector.
2. SFBs are primarily intended to cater to the financial needs of large corporations and multinational companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Small Finance Banks (SFBs) are a type of bank specifically designed to cater to the financial needs of small businesses, farmers, and individuals in underserved areas.  They play a crucial role in promoting financial inclusion by providing credit and other financial services to those who may have limited access to traditional banking institutions.   Their focus on small businesses contributes directly to the growth and development of the MSME (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) sector, a vital component of the Indian economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SFBs are explicitly *not* intended to serve large corporations or multinational companies.  Their mandate is precisely the opposite: to provide financial services to the segments of the population and business community often excluded from mainstream banking.  Large corporations typically have access to a wide range of funding options, whereas SFBs address the credit gap for smaller entities.


**9. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMMY's primary objective is to provide loans to farmers for agricultural purposes.
2. PMMY aims to integrate small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing them with access to credit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is not primarily focused on agricultural loans. While some farmers might benefit from the scheme, its main target is small businesses and entrepreneurs, specifically those in the non-farm sector.  The scheme aims to provide funding to support their business activities and help them grow.

Statement 2 is correct. The core objective of PMMY is to promote entrepreneurship and job creation by providing collateral-free loans to small businesses and entrepreneurs, thereby helping them formally register their businesses and integrate into the mainstream financial system.  Before PMMY, many small businesses operated informally due to a lack of access to formal credit; PMMY aims to address this issue and foster economic growth.


**10. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Legal tender money refers to money that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in repayment of debts.
2.  Cheques and drafts are considered legal tender money.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Legal tender is currency that a creditor must accept as payment for a debt. This is a legal requirement.  Governments designate certain forms of money as legal tender to ensure that transactions can be settled without dispute.  The specific forms of legal tender can vary by country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Cheques and drafts are not legal tender. While widely accepted as a means of payment, they represent a promise to pay, not a direct legal obligation to accept them as settlement of a debt.  A creditor can refuse to accept a cheque or draft, unlike legal tender currency, which must be accepted.  The acceptance of cheques and drafts relies on trust and banking systems, not legal compulsion.


**11. With reference to "Bitcoins," consider the following statements:**

1.  Central banks of countries directly track and regulate Bitcoin transactions.
2. Bitcoin transactions can be conducted anonymously, without revealing the identities of the parties involved.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning it operates independently of central banks or governments.  Central banks do not track or directly regulate Bitcoin transactions. While some governments are increasingly regulating aspects of Bitcoin's use (like anti-money laundering measures), they don't have direct control over the Bitcoin network itself.

Statement 2 is correct.  One of Bitcoin's key features is its pseudonymous nature. Transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, but they are identified by Bitcoin addresses, not necessarily the real-world identities of the users.  This allows for a degree of anonymity, though sophisticated tracing techniques can sometimes link addresses to individuals.  However, the inherent design makes tracing difficult compared to traditional banking systems.


**12.  With reference to the "Government's Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme" and "Gold Monetization Scheme," consider the following statements:**

1.  These schemes aim to reduce India's reliance on gold imports by mobilizing domestic gold holdings.
2.  A primary goal of these schemes is to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Both the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are designed to bring idle gold held by households and institutions into the formal financial system.  By doing so, India can reduce its dependence on gold imports, a significant drain on foreign exchange reserves.  These schemes offer an alternative to physical gold holding, encouraging investment in government securities or monetizing gold for economic use.

Statement 2 is incorrect. These schemes are not primarily aimed at attracting FDI in the gold and jewelry sector. Their focus is on domestic gold mobilization to improve the country's balance of payments and enhance the efficiency of gold utilization within the economy. While FDI might indirectly benefit from a more organized gold market, it is not the central objective of these schemes.


**13. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Central Government.
2. The RBI Act grants the RBI complete autonomy, and the Central Government cannot issue any directions to the RBI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is appointed by the President of India, but the appointment process involves the recommendation of the Central Government.  While the President formally appoints the Governor, the government plays a key role in selecting candidates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the RBI enjoys a significant degree of autonomy in its operations, the Central Government does retain the power to issue directions to the RBI in the public interest.  This power is explicitly mentioned in the RBI Act, reflecting the government's ultimate responsibility for maintaining macroeconomic stability.  The government's ability to direct the RBI is a safeguard to ensure that the RBI's actions align with the overall economic policy goals of the nation.


**14. With reference to the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) for banks, consider the following statements:**

1. CAR is the percentage of a bank's own capital (equity and reserves) relative to its risk-weighted assets, serving as a buffer against potential losses.
2. Each individual bank determines its own CAR based on its risk assessment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a crucial regulatory measure for banks globally.  It mandates that banks maintain a minimum level of capital (equity and reserves) relative to their risk-weighted assets. This capital serves as a buffer to absorb potential losses arising from bad loans or other financial risks.  A higher CAR indicates a stronger financial position for the bank.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAR is not determined by individual banks.  Regulatory authorities, such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in India, set minimum CAR requirements that all banks must meet. While banks may have internal risk assessment models, the minimum CAR is a legally mandated standard that ensures a minimum level of capital adequacy across the banking system.  This standardized approach maintains stability and confidence in the banking sector.


**15. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Deposits held by customers are considered assets of the bank.
2. Advances (loans) given by the bank are considered assets of the bank.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Deposits held by customers are liabilities for a commercial bank, not assets.  These represent the bank's obligations to its depositors.  The bank is responsible for returning these deposits to customers on demand.

Statement 2 is correct. Advances, which represent the loans given out by a bank to its customers are assets of the bank.  These loans generate interest income for the bank, and the principal amount is eventually repaid by the borrowers.  The outstanding loans are a significant component of a bank's asset portfolio.


**16. With reference to factors contributing to reducing the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Remittances from Indians working abroad increase the supply of foreign currency, bolstering the Rupee and reducing vulnerability to currency crises.
2. Increasing government expenditure always strengthens a nation's currency and reduces vulnerability to currency crises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Remittances are funds sent by individuals working abroad to their home country.  These inflows of foreign currency increase the supply of foreign exchange, strengthening the domestic currency and enhancing the country's ability to withstand external shocks that might trigger a currency crisis.  A higher level of foreign exchange reserves acts as a buffer against potential currency fluctuations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Increasing government expenditure can actually *weaken* a currency, depending on how it's financed.  If the government finances increased spending by borrowing from abroad, it increases the demand for foreign currency, potentially putting downward pressure on the domestic currency.  Furthermore, if the increased spending fuels inflation, this can make the country's goods and services less competitive internationally, leading to a weaker currency.  Therefore, increasing government expenditure does not always strengthen a nation's currency and reduce vulnerability to currency crises.


**17. With reference to the immediate effect of withdrawing a large sum of cash from a demand deposit account, consider the following statements:**

1.  The aggregate money supply in the economy will decrease by the exact amount withdrawn.
2. The aggregate money supply will decrease by more than the amount withdrawn because of the money multiplier effect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the immediate effect of withdrawing cash from a demand deposit account is a reduction in the bank's reserves, the impact on the aggregate money supply is not a simple one-to-one reduction.  The money multiplier effect comes into play. The money multiplier effect means that a change in the monetary base (like a cash withdrawal) has a magnified effect on the overall money supply.

Statement 2 is correct.  When cash is withdrawn, the bank's reserves decrease, limiting its capacity to create credit.  This reduction in lending potential leads to a contraction in the money supply, but the decrease is larger than the initial cash withdrawal because of the money multiplier effect.  The money multiplier effect works in reverse during withdrawals, leading to a greater reduction in the overall money supply than the amount of cash withdrawn.


**18. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, consider the following statements about its purposes:**

1.  The KCC scheme provides short-term credit for post-harvest expenses incurred by farmers.
2.  The KCC scheme provides funds for the construction of family houses and setting up of village cold storage facilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme is a crucial initiative to provide farmers with timely credit access.  One of its primary objectives is to provide short-term credit for post-harvest expenses such as transportation, processing, and marketing of agricultural produce.  This ensures that farmers can manage their finances effectively throughout the agricultural cycle.

Statement 2 is incorrect. KCC primarily focuses on short-term credit needs directly related to agricultural operations.  Long-term investments like house construction or setting up village cold storage facilities are not typically covered under the KCC scheme.  These require different kinds of financing options and projects.  KCC is designed for working capital and short-term needs, not long-term capital investments.


**19. With reference to financial instruments in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds.
2.  Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are long-term instruments issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to corporations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Commercial paper is a short-term debt instrument issued by large and creditworthy corporations to raise funds from the money market.  It's an unsecured promissory note, meaning it doesn't involve collateral.  It's a way for companies to access short-term financing without going through a bank loan process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term borrowing instruments issued by banks, not the RBI.  While the RBI regulates the issuance of CDs, it does not issue them directly. CDs are used by banks to raise funds from large depositors, offering a higher rate of interest than regular savings accounts.  They are not long-term instruments; their maturity periods are typically less than a year.


**20. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI primarily involves investments made by foreign institutional investors in government securities.
2. FDI is characterized by a largely non-debt-creating capital flow, representing equity investment in companies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is primarily equity investment made by foreign entities in domestic companies to gain control or significant influence.  Investment in government securities is typically considered Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), not FDI.  FPI is more short-term and less focused on ownership or management control.

Statement 2 is correct. FDI is characterized by a long-term investment perspective, aiming for a lasting stake in the domestic company's operations. It's mostly equity-based, meaning it doesn't involve debt servicing in the same way as loans or bonds.  The investor seeks a share of ownership and potential returns from the company's profits.  This distinguishes it from portfolio investment, which is more focused on short-term financial gains.


**21. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. UCBs are supervised and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. UCBs cannot issue equity shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  While they operate under the cooperative structure, their banking activities are subject to RBI supervision to ensure financial stability and customer protection.  The RBI sets guidelines and conducts inspections of UCBs to maintain standards.

Statement 2 is incorrect. UCBs can issue equity shares.  This is a common feature of cooperative banks, allowing them to raise capital from members and investors.  The issuance of equity shares is part of their capital structure and fundraising mechanisms.


**22. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following statements:**

1. Actions taken by the United States Federal Reserve (the US central bank) can influence Indian bond yields.
2. Inflation in India has no impact on Indian government bond yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Global financial markets are interconnected.  Actions by the US Federal Reserve, such as changes in interest rates, significantly impact global capital flows.  These flows can influence demand for Indian government bonds, thereby affecting their yields.  If US interest rates rise, investors might shift funds to US securities, reducing demand for Indian bonds and potentially pushing yields higher.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Inflation is a major factor influencing government bond yields.  Higher inflation erodes the purchasing power of future interest payments on bonds, making them less attractive to investors.  To compensate for this, investors demand higher yields on bonds to maintain their real rate of return, so higher inflation generally leads to higher bond yields.


**23. With reference to instruments that can be included in Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), consider the following:**

1. Foreign currency convertible bonds are a form of FDI.
2. Non-resident external deposits are a form of FDI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Foreign currency convertible bonds are typically considered a form of Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), not FDI.  While they involve foreign investment, they don't necessarily represent a long-term equity stake or management control in a domestic company, which are hallmarks of FDI.  They are debt instruments with an option to convert into equity, but the primary nature is debt-based.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Non-resident external deposits are not FDI.  These deposits are held by non-residents in accounts that are typically not directly invested in the domestic economy or companies.  They represent short-term capital flows, not long-term investments aimed at establishing ownership or control, which is the defining feature of FDI.


**24. With reference to the effects of currency devaluation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Devaluation makes domestic exports more competitive in foreign markets.
2. Devaluation necessarily improves a country's trade balance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Currency devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers because it takes less foreign currency to purchase the same amount of domestic goods.  This increased price competitiveness can lead to higher demand for exports.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While devaluation can improve a country's trade balance by making exports more competitive, it's not a guaranteed outcome.  The effectiveness of devaluation depends on several factors, including the elasticity of demand for exports and imports, the reactions of other countries, and the overall state of the global economy.  If demand for exports is inelastic (doesn't change much with price changes), or if import prices also rise significantly, the improvement in the trade balance might be limited or even absent.  Furthermore, other countries might retaliate with their own devaluations, negating the initial benefits.



**25. With reference to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following:**

1. Expansionary fiscal policies can contribute to demand-pull inflation.
2. Rising interest rates contribute to demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply.  Expansionary fiscal policies, such as increased government spending or tax cuts, can boost aggregate demand.  If this increase in demand is not met by a corresponding increase in supply, it can lead to upward pressure on prices, resulting in demand-pull inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rising interest rates generally *curb* demand-pull inflation.  Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, reducing investment and consumer spending, thereby decreasing aggregate demand. This helps to cool down an overheating economy and control inflationary pressures.  Rising interest rates are usually a contractionary monetary policy tool to combat inflation.


**1. With reference to India's developmental strategies, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Five-Year Plan prioritized industrialization as the primary driver of economic growth.
2. The Second Five-Year Plan emphasized the development of agriculture as the cornerstone of the nation's economic progress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The First Five-Year Plan (1951-1956) in India primarily focused on agricultural development, recognizing its crucial role in poverty reduction and overall economic stability.  Industrialization was a secondary focus, with emphasis on building a strong agricultural base before significant industrial expansion.  The plan's success is largely attributed to its emphasis on irrigation and agricultural improvements, leading to increased food production and a reduction in reliance on imports.

Statement 2 is correct. The Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1961) shifted its focus towards industrialization, specifically heavy industries, aiming for rapid industrial growth and a socialist pattern of society.  While agriculture remained important, the plan prioritized investments in steel, coal, and other heavy industries to boost industrial capacity and propel economic growth. This represented a strategic shift from the agrarian focus of the First Five-Year Plan.  However, the agricultural sector still received significant attention, particularly with initiatives like the Green Revolution that began to gain momentum later.  Therefore, the statement accurately reflects the Second Plan's emphasis on agriculture's importance even within the larger context of industrial development.


**2. With reference to India's economic reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Second Generation of Economic Reforms" included significant reforms in the legal system to improve the business environment.
2. The "Second Generation of Economic Reforms" prioritized reforms in government and public institutions to enhance efficiency and transparency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the overall aim of the "Second Generation of Economic Reforms" was to improve the business environment, legal system reforms were not a central focus. The reforms mainly concentrated on areas like infrastructure development, streamlining regulations, attracting foreign investment and promoting competition.  Legal reforms, although important for the long-term health of the economy, were not a primary component of this specific phase of reforms.

Statement 2 is correct. The "Second Generation of Economic Reforms" in India strongly emphasized reforms in government and public institutions.  The goal was to enhance efficiency, reduce bureaucracy, increase transparency, and improve governance. This was seen as essential for creating a more conducive environment for private sector growth and attracting foreign investment.  Initiatives aimed at improving public sector efficiency, reducing corruption, and strengthening regulatory frameworks were key aspects of this phase.


**3. With reference to economic indicators, consider the following statements:**

1. A high capital-output ratio indicates that a significant increase in capital investment is required to generate a small increase in output.
2. A low proportion of labor in GNP indicates that the economy is highly capital-intensive and technologically advanced.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The capital-output ratio measures the amount of capital investment needed to produce one unit of output. A high capital-output ratio suggests that the economy is capital-intensive, meaning it requires substantial capital investment to generate a relatively small increase in output. This can be due to factors such as inefficient technology, low productivity, or underutilization of capital.  A high ratio often signals a need for technological improvements or structural reforms to enhance efficiency.

Statement 2 is correct. A low proportion of labor in GNP (Gross National Product) implies that a smaller portion of the national income is generated by labor compared to capital. This is a characteristic of economies that are highly capital-intensive and have adopted advanced technologies that substitute labor with capital. These economies often have higher levels of automation, mechanization, and sophisticated technology, leading to increased productivity but potentially also higher unemployment or underemployment in certain sectors.  This phenomenon is often associated with developed or rapidly developing economies.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates a depreciation of the rupee.
2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates a worsening of trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is an index that measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies. An *increase* in NEER indicates an *appreciation* of the domestic currency (in this case, the rupee) relative to the basket of currencies.  A decrease in NEER would indicate a depreciation.  The statement confuses the direction of the change in NEER with its implication for currency value.

Statement 2 is correct. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) adjusts the NEER for inflation differentials between the domestic economy and its trading partners.  An *increase* in REER indicates that the domestic currency has become *more expensive* relative to other currencies, considering inflation. This makes exports less competitive and imports more attractive, thus worsening the trade competitiveness of the domestic economy.  A decrease in REER would improve trade competitiveness.


**5. With reference to economic growth and development, consider the following statements:**

1.  Increases in absolute and per capita real GNP always signify higher levels of economic development.
2.  Poverty and unemployment, even if increasing, do not necessarily negate the positive impact of rising real GNP.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While increases in real GNP (Gross National Product) indicate economic growth, they do not automatically translate to higher levels of economic development.  Economic development is a broader concept encompassing improvements in various social indicators like health, education, infrastructure, and income distribution, in addition to economic growth.  A country might experience growth in GNP without necessarily improving the living standards of its population if the benefits are not equitably distributed.  For example, a rise in GNP driven by increased exports of raw materials might not reflect improvements in the well-being of the overall population.

Statement 2 is correct.  Rising real GNP can have a positive impact on the economy even if poverty and unemployment persist.  However, the extent of this positive impact depends on several factors, including the rate of growth, the distribution of income, and the effectiveness of government policies aimed at poverty reduction and job creation.  While persistent poverty and unemployment are serious concerns, they do not entirely negate the benefits of economic growth as measured by real GNP.  The challenge lies in ensuring that economic growth is inclusive and leads to improvements in the living standards of all segments of the population, not just the wealthy.


**6. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The WPI gives more weight to food items in its calculation than the CPI.
2. The CPI captures changes in service prices, which the WPI does not.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPI (Consumer Price Index) gives a higher weight to food items compared to the WPI (Wholesale Price Index). This is because the CPI reflects the prices of goods and services consumed by households, and food constitutes a significant portion of household expenditure, especially for lower-income groups.  The WPI, on the other hand, tracks the prices of goods at the wholesale level, giving less weight to food items relative to other goods.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CPI includes a broader range of goods and services, including services, which are not typically included in the WPI.  The WPI primarily focuses on the prices of goods traded in wholesale markets, neglecting the significant contribution of services to overall inflation in many modern economies.  Therefore, the CPI provides a more comprehensive measure of inflation for consumers, reflecting changes in the prices of both goods and services, while the WPI largely focuses on goods.


**7.  With reference to the characteristics of the Indian economy in the pre-1991 era, consider the following statements:**

1.  The License Raj fostered competition and entrepreneurship within the Indian economy.
2.  The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act of 1969 encouraged the expansion of large industrial houses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The License Raj, a system of pervasive government controls and regulations in the Indian economy before 1991, was widely criticized for stifling competition and entrepreneurship.  The need for licenses to start or expand businesses created bureaucratic hurdles, favored established firms, and discouraged new entrants.  This led to inefficiencies, lack of innovation, and a limited number of players in many sectors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MRTP Act of 1969 aimed to curb the growth of monopolies and restrict restrictive trade practices.  It had the opposite effect of what was intended for large industrial houses.  It placed restrictions on the expansion of large business groups, hindering their growth and potentially stifling innovation. The act was widely seen as detrimental to economic growth and efficiency, and it was eventually repealed as part of the economic liberalization reforms of 1991.


**8. With reference to India's economic development, consider the following statements:**

1. The Green Revolution primarily benefited small and marginal farmers, leading to greater income equality in rural areas.
2. Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) successfully fostered technological advancement and international competitiveness in Indian industries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Green Revolution significantly increased food production in India, its benefits were not equally distributed.  Large and medium farmers, who had access to irrigation, credit, and improved technology, benefited disproportionately, widening the income gap between them and small and marginal farmers.  This led to increased regional disparities and heightened social inequalities in rural areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI), a strategy that emphasized domestic production to replace imports, did not lead to significant technological advancement or international competitiveness in many Indian industries.  The protection from foreign competition fostered inefficiency, lack of innovation, and a dependence on government support.  This ultimately hampered the growth and development of many sectors, making them less competitive in the global market.  The strategy was widely criticized for its negative impact on efficiency and innovation.


**9. With reference to inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth primarily focuses on income redistribution to achieve greater equality.
2.  Inclusive growth emphasizes productive employment opportunities for all segments of society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While inclusive growth aims to reduce inequality, it does not primarily focus on income redistribution through direct transfer payments.  It emphasizes creating opportunities for all segments of the population to participate in and benefit from economic growth, leading to improved living standards for everyone. Direct income redistribution can be a part of a broader strategy but is not the core of inclusive growth.  The emphasis is on sustainable, long-term solutions rather than short-term fixes.

Statement 2 is correct. Inclusive growth prioritizes the creation of productive employment opportunities for all segments of society, regardless of their background or location.  This ensures that the benefits of economic growth are shared widely, leading to poverty reduction and improved living standards.  Focus is on creating jobs that are not only numerous but also offer decent wages, benefits, and opportunities for skill development, ensuring sustainable livelihoods for all.  This approach is crucial for reducing disparities and promoting social justice.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on aspects of Indian economic development, poverty, and policy, demanding factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. With reference to the "Hindu rate of growth," consider the following statements:**

1.  It refers to the average annual growth rate of per capita income in India during the period before the 1980s economic reforms.
2.  The term was coined to highlight the slow pace of economic growth experienced by India during that period, which contrasted with faster growth rates seen in other developing countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "Hindu rate of growth" is a term coined to describe India's relatively slow economic growth rate, typically around 3.5% per annum, before the 1991 economic reforms.  This slow growth was primarily reflected in per capita income figures. The term highlighted the stagnation compared to the growth rates achieved by several other developing nations during the same period. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the meaning and context of the "Hindu rate of growth."


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the License Raj in India:**

1. The License Raj aimed to promote competition and entrepreneurship by regulating industrial production.
2.  The system often led to delays, inefficiency, and the creation of vested interests among bureaucrats and businesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The License Raj, a system of extensive government licensing and regulation of the Indian economy, was implemented with the goals of planned investment, wealth redistribution, and protection of small-scale industries.  However, its implementation created numerous bureaucratic hurdles, fostered inefficiency, and led to delays in project approvals.  It also facilitated the creation of vested interests that benefited from the system's complexities and loopholes. While statement 1 mentions the stated goals, the actual outcome was contrary to its intended purpose. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the consequences of the License Raj.


**3. With reference to the impact of the Green Revolution in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Green Revolution significantly contributed to poverty reduction in India primarily through its impact on agricultural productivity.
2. The Green Revolution's success was primarily due to extensive government anti-poverty interventions implemented simultaneously.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The Green Revolution, marked by the introduction of high-yielding varieties of seeds and improved agricultural practices, led to a substantial increase in agricultural production in India. This increase in agricultural output significantly impacted poverty levels, particularly in rural areas where a large proportion of the poor resided.  However, the success of the Green Revolution was primarily a result of technological advancements and agricultural innovations, not solely government anti-poverty programmes, although those played a supporting role. Therefore, statement 1 correctly identifies the primary impact, while statement 2 misrepresents the primary driver of the Green Revolution's success.


**4. With reference to India's economic reforms of 1991 (LPG reforms), consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms involved a significant increase in import duties to protect domestic industries.
2. The reforms aimed to liberalize, privatize, and globalize the Indian economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The 1991 economic reforms in India, often referred to as LPG reforms (Liberalization, Privatization, Globalization), were aimed at reducing the role of the state in the economy, promoting private sector participation, and integrating the Indian economy with the global economy. A key aspect of liberalization involved reducing import duties and trade barriers, rather than increasing them as stated in statement 1. Statement 2 accurately captures the core objectives of the reforms.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the characteristics of inclusive growth:**

1. Inclusive growth prioritizes income redistribution schemes as the primary mechanism for poverty reduction.
2. Inclusive growth emphasizes the creation of productive employment opportunities for all segments of the population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Inclusive growth focuses on ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared broadly across the population, not just limited to a select few. While income redistribution can play a role in addressing inequality, inclusive growth primarily focuses on creating sustainable economic opportunities for all, including the poor and marginalized. This involves generating employment, improving access to resources, and promoting equitable development.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this focus on productive employment, while statement 1 incorrectly emphasizes income redistribution as the primary mechanism. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to India's Five-Year Plans, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Five-Year Plan primarily focused on rapid industrialization and heavy industry development.
2. The Third Five-Year Plan aimed to achieve self-reliance and self-generating economic growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** India's Five-Year Plans represented a centrally planned approach to economic development. The First Five-Year Plan (1951-1956) prioritized agriculture, infrastructure development (irrigation, power, transport), and price stability due to the prevailing post-independence conditions.  The Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1966) aimed to establish a self-reliant and self-generating economy, focusing on industrial growth alongside agriculture.  Statement 1 misrepresents the focus of the First Plan, while statement 2 accurately reflects the objective of the Third Plan. Thus, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), consider the following statements:**

1. AIM is a government initiative focused on promoting innovation and entrepreneurship primarily in the agricultural sector.
2. AIM's objectives include developing policies and programmes for fostering innovation across various sectors and creating a supportive ecosystem for startups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) is a flagship initiative of the Indian government aimed at fostering innovation and entrepreneurship across all sectors of the economy. While AIM supports innovation in various fields, its focus isn't limited to the agricultural sector as implied in statement 1.  Statement 2 correctly identifies AIM's broader objectives, including policy development, ecosystem creation, and support for startups.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements about India's Startup India initiative:**

1. The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Swaniyojan Yojana is a central government scheme aimed at promoting startups in rural areas.
2.  The Startup India initiative has significantly contributed to India having one of the largest startup ecosystems globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Swaniyojan Yojana (DDU-SY), while not exclusively focused on startups, is a rural self-employment programme that indirectly contributes to the growth of rural entrepreneurship, which can include startups.  Statement 2 is also factually correct; India's Startup India initiative has indeed resulted in a significantly large and vibrant startup ecosystem, placing it among the top three globally. Therefore, both statements are correct.


**9. With reference to the National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy aimed to address the challenge of a surplus of highly trained workforce in India.
2. The policy aimed to connect the supply of skilled human resources with sectoral demands.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship 2015 aimed to address the dual challenge of a shortage of skilled workers and the unemployability of many conventionally educated youth.  Statement 1 incorrectly states that the policy addressed a surplus of highly trained workforce; the actual problem was a lack of skilled workers.  Statement 2 accurately reflects one of the policy's core objectives –  to improve the alignment between the skills possessed by the workforce and the demands of various sectors.  Only statement 2 is correct.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the National Single Window System (NSWS) in India:**

1. NSWS is designed to streamline the process of obtaining government approvals and registrations for businesses and investors.
2. NSWS aims to increase information asymmetry and make the process of obtaining approvals more opaque.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The National Single Window System (NSWS) is a digital platform designed to simplify and expedite the process of obtaining various government approvals and registrations required by businesses and investors.  It aims to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and improve transparency and accountability. Statement 1 accurately describes this objective.  Statement 2 is incorrect; NSWS aims to *reduce* information asymmetry, not increase it, by providing all necessary information on a single platform, making the process more transparent. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember that the explanations assume the accuracy of the provided source material.

**1. With reference to Human Capital Formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Investment in education is the sole primary source of human capital formation.
2.  Migration, while involving costs, can contribute to human capital formation due to increased earning potential in new locations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While investment in education is a significant source of human capital formation, it's not the only one.  The text explicitly mentions other sources such as investments in health, on-the-job training, and migration.  Focusing solely on education overlooks the multifaceted nature of human capital development and ignores crucial contributions from other sectors.  A comprehensive approach to human capital formation requires a balanced investment across various areas to achieve optimal results.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that migration, despite incurring costs like transportation and adjustment to new environments, can contribute to human capital formation. This is because the increased earning potential in the new location outweighs the initial investment.  This highlights the dynamic nature of human capital, where individuals actively seek opportunities to enhance their skills and earning capacity, even if it involves relocation.  The increased productivity in the new location adds to the overall human capital of the nation.


**2. With reference to Poverty in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "jail cost of living" method, initially used by Dadabhai Naoroji to estimate the poverty line, accurately accounts for the diverse needs of all members of society.
2.  The Green Revolution, while increasing agricultural production, exacerbated regional disparities and inequalities between large and small farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dadabhai Naoroji's "jail cost of living" method, while innovative for its time, had limitations.  It based the poverty line on the cost of living for prisoners, a homogeneous group that doesn't represent the diverse needs of an entire population, particularly children and different age groups with varying needs.  Therefore, it's not a completely accurate measure of poverty across all societal segments.  More sophisticated methods are now used to account for varied needs and consumption patterns of different demographics.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that the Green Revolution, while beneficial in increasing food grain production, led to increased regional disparities and inequalities between large and small farmers.  This is because the benefits of the new technologies were not equally distributed, favoring those with access to resources like irrigation and capital.  This uneven distribution exacerbated existing inequalities, highlighting a key challenge in development policies.


**3. With reference to India’s Economic Reforms of 1991, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms led to a significant increase in the share of agriculture in GDP.
2.  The reforms resulted in a substantial increase in India's foreign exchange reserves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text indicates that the share of agriculture in GDP *did not* increase enormously after the 1991 reforms.  In fact, the growth of the agricultural sector slowed down during this period.  This points to the challenges of integrating agricultural development with broader economic liberalization, highlighting the need for targeted policies to support this crucial sector.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that India's foreign exchange reserves increased substantially after the 1991 reforms. This increase reflects the positive impact of liberalization on attracting foreign investment and boosting exports.  This demonstrates one of the successes of the reform process, although it doesn't address all the economic challenges faced by India.


**4.  With reference to India's Five-Year Plans, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Second Five-Year Plan, also known as the Mahalanobis Plan, prioritized agricultural development over industrialization.
2.  The Fifth Five-Year Plan focused on poverty alleviation ("Garibi Hatao") and self-reliance as its primary objectives.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Second Five-Year Plan, or Mahalanobis Plan, prioritized rapid industrialization, particularly in heavy and basic industries.  This strategy reflected a focus on building a strong industrial base as a foundation for long-term economic growth. While agriculture was important, it was given a lower priority compared to the industrial sector in this plan.

Statement 2 is correct. The Fifth Five-Year Plan clearly aimed at removing poverty ("Garibi Hatao") and achieving self-reliance. These objectives reflected a broader socio-economic focus, recognizing the need to address poverty alongside economic growth and reduce dependence on foreign assistance.


**5. With reference to Infrastructure in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP is significantly higher than that of China.
2.  Access to improved sanitation in rural India was significantly low even by 1996.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text shows that India's infrastructure investment as a percentage of GDP is considerably *lower* than that of China. This highlights a significant gap in resource allocation and the need for increased investment in infrastructure to support economic growth.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text explicitly mentions that access to improved sanitation in rural areas was only 6% by 1996.  This underscores the significant challenges in providing basic amenities to a large rural population, highlighting the need for sustained government efforts and investment in rural infrastructure development.


**6. With reference to the Indian Economy post-2014, consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission to allocate funds directly to ministries and states.
2. The services sector's high employment of skilled workers is a primary reason for India's high unemployment among unskilled laborers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, the function of allocating funds to ministries and states shifted to the Finance Ministry, not NITI Aayog. This reflects a change in the structure of economic planning and resource allocation within the Indian government.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage points out that the services sector primarily employs skilled labor, while India's abundant unskilled labor force is largely unemployed.  This mismatch between the skills required by the growing service sector and the available workforce highlights a major challenge in India's employment landscape, necessitating skill development initiatives and job creation in sectors employing unskilled labor.


**7. With reference to the challenges faced by the Indian economy during the reform period (post-1991), consider the following statements:**

1.  The reforms resulted in a significant increase in employment opportunities.
2.  Reduced public investment in agricultural infrastructure negatively impacted the sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that despite increased GDP growth, the reforms did *not* generate sufficient employment opportunities, highlighting a major criticism of the reform process.  This mismatch between growth and employment creation necessitates a focus on policies that create jobs, particularly for the unskilled workforce.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that reduced public investment in agricultural infrastructure, including irrigation, power, and research, negatively impacted the agricultural sector. This highlights the unintended consequences of liberalization and the need for targeted support to vulnerable sectors.  The reduction in public investment created further constraints on already struggling small and marginal farmers.


**1. With reference to India's Five-Year Plans, consider the following statements:**

1. The First Five-Year Plan primarily focused on agriculture, price stability, power, and transport, achieving considerable success due to good harvests in its later years.
2. The Second Five-Year Plan, also known as the Mahalanobis Plan, prioritized rapid industrialization, particularly in heavy and basic industries, but faced challenges due to foreign exchange shortages and price increases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the priorities and outcomes of India's First Five-Year Plan (1951-56).  The plan, heavily influenced by the post-independence economic context (refugee influx, food shortages, inflation), successfully focused on agricultural development, infrastructure improvements (power and transport), and price stabilization.  The good harvests towards the end of the plan significantly contributed to its success in meeting several of its objectives.

Statement 2 correctly describes the core features and challenges of the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-61).  The plan, largely shaped by P.C. Mahalanobis's model, emphasized rapid industrialization, particularly in heavy industries like steel and infrastructure.  However, its reliance on substantial foreign loans and imports led to significant foreign exchange constraints and inflationary pressures, ultimately resulting in a less than fully successful outcome despite achieving a respectable growth rate.  The plan's ambition to rapidly industrialize, while bold, was hampered by the limitations of the Indian economy at that time.


**2. With reference to India's economic policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 categorized industries into three categories: state-owned, state-regulated with private sector supplementation, and purely private sector.
2. The import substitution strategy, prominent in India's early Five-Year Plans, aimed to protect domestic industries by restricting imports through tariffs and quotas, thereby hindering export promotion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956.  This policy, a cornerstone of India's socialist-inspired economic planning, categorized industries based on ownership and control, aiming to balance state intervention with private sector participation.  The categorization was crucial in determining the extent of government involvement and control in various industrial sectors.  This policy reflected the prevailing economic ideology and developmental priorities of the time.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the characteristics of India's import substitution strategy. This inward-looking approach, dominant during the early Five-Year Plans, prioritized domestic production by erecting barriers to imports via tariffs and quotas. While protecting nascent industries, this strategy inadvertently limited the development of export-oriented sectors, as resources and focus were primarily directed towards the domestic market, and the need to enhance competitiveness in the global market was largely overlooked.


**3. With reference to the concept of inclusive growth, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth, as defined by the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, emphasizes equitable development and growth with social justice, ensuring broad-based benefits and equal opportunities for all segments of the population.
2.  Inclusive growth strategies in developing countries should prioritize productive employment over direct income redistribution, although short-term income support measures might be necessary to mitigate the impact of growth-oriented policies on vulnerable groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects the Eleventh Five-Year Plan's definition of inclusive growth.  The plan explicitly aimed to move beyond simply increasing GDP, focusing instead on a growth process that benefits all sections of society and ensures equal opportunities. This emphasis on equity and social justice was a significant shift in developmental thinking, highlighting the social and human development dimensions of economic growth.

Statement 2 accurately reflects a key principle of sustainable inclusive growth strategies.  While direct income redistribution can provide short-term relief,  long-term sustainable inclusive growth depends on creating productive employment opportunities for the poor and marginalized. This approach focuses on empowering individuals to participate in and benefit from economic growth over the long term, rather than relying on temporary and potentially unsustainable welfare programs.  This emphasizes the importance of human capital development and structural transformation to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth.


**4. With reference to India's post-liberalization economic experience, consider the following statements:**

1. The growth of India's service sector has significantly contributed to GDP growth after 1991, but has not generated sufficient employment opportunities for the large unskilled labor force.
2.  India's manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP remains relatively low compared to the service sector, partly because India struggles to compete effectively in low-skilled manufacturing despite excelling in skilled manufacturing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key aspect of India's post-liberalization economic growth. While the service sector has experienced remarkable growth and significantly contributed to GDP, this growth has not translated into sufficient employment opportunities for India's large, unskilled workforce. This mismatch between growth and employment generation highlights the challenge of creating jobs that absorb the vast pool of unskilled labor.  This has led to concerns about inclusiveness and the benefits of growth reaching all segments of the population.

Statement 2 correctly points to the relatively low contribution of the manufacturing sector to India's GDP compared to the services sector.  India's competitive advantage lies in higher-skilled manufacturing, while it faces challenges in competing in low-skilled manufacturing due to factors such as higher labor costs, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory hurdles. This imbalance underscores the need for policy interventions to boost the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP and employment generation.


**5. With reference to the Government Budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Revenue is primarily responsible for the preparation of the Union Budget presented to the Parliament.
2.  All disbursements from the Public Account require authorization from the Parliament of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Department of Revenue plays a central role in the preparation of the Union Budget, particularly regarding tax revenue projections and expenditure proposals related to revenue collection. However, the budget is a collaborative effort involving various ministries and departments, and the final budget is approved by the Finance Minister and presented to the Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Consolidated Fund of India requires parliamentary authorization for withdrawals, the Public Account, which holds various government funds (like small savings schemes and deposits), does not necessitate parliamentary authorization for every disbursement.  The rules governing the Public Account are distinct from those of the Consolidated Fund.


**6. With reference to India's economic indicators, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates a depreciation of the Indian Rupee.
2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in India's trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in NEER signifies an appreciation of the Rupee, meaning it takes more units of foreign currency to buy one Rupee.  A decrease in NEER would indicate a depreciation.  This is a crucial concept in understanding exchange rate dynamics.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  An increase in REER suggests a loss of trade competitiveness, as it indicates that domestic goods are becoming more expensive relative to foreign goods, making exports less attractive and imports more attractive. A decrease in REER would usually indicate an improvement in trade competitiveness.


**7. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. GST replaced multiple taxes levied by multiple authorities, creating a single national market and simplifying indirect taxation.
2. GST has drastically reduced India's current account deficit and significantly increased its foreign exchange reserves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is a correct assessment of a major objective and outcome of GST implementation in India. By subsuming a multitude of indirect taxes under a single, unified tax system, GST aimed to and largely succeeded in creating a more seamless national market, reducing the complexities of interstate trade and improving tax efficiency.  This simplification streamlined business operations and reduced compliance burdens.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While GST has had positive impacts on the Indian economy, it does not directly and drastically affect the current account deficit or foreign exchange reserves.  These balances are influenced by a far broader array of factors, including global trade flows, capital movements, and commodity prices, that are not directly related to GST.


**8. With reference to  fiscal stimulus, consider the following statements:**

1. A fiscal stimulus involves massive government investment in the manufacturing sector to meet demand surges.
2. A fiscal stimulus is an intense government action aimed at boosting overall economic activity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification of fiscal stimulus. While government investment in infrastructure and specific sectors can be part of a broader stimulus package, a fiscal stimulus is not limited to manufacturing or solely focused on meeting demand surges.  Stimulus measures can involve a range of policy actions.

Statement 2 accurately captures the essence of a fiscal stimulus.  It is a deliberate and significant government intervention designed to boost economic activity during periods of slowdown or recession. This can involve tax cuts, increased government spending, or a combination of both, to inject more money into the economy and stimulate demand.


**9. With reference to  the sources of human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Investment in health, including preventive and curative medicine, improves the health of the labor force, leading to increased productivity and human capital formation.
2. Migration of skilled labor to other countries can be a source of human capital formation for the source country, as it generates remittances that contribute to overall economic development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies investment in health as a crucial source of human capital formation.  Improved health leads to a more productive and efficient workforce, contributing to higher economic output.  This includes both preventive measures (vaccinations) and curative measures (treatment of illnesses).  A healthy population is essential for a country's economic progress.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While remittances from skilled workers who migrate abroad can contribute to the source country's economy, the migration itself represents a loss of human capital for that country.  The emigration of skilled workers deprives the source country of their expertise and potential contribution to national productivity.  Therefore, emigration of skilled labor is not considered a positive source of human capital formation.


**10. With reference to  the challenges faced by India in achieving its potential GDP, consider the following statements:**

1. Weak administrative machinery and bureaucratic hurdles can impede efficient resource allocation and implementation of policies aimed at boosting economic growth, hindering the realization of potential GDP.
2. High population density always leads to lower per capita income and restricts the potential for economic growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately identifies a significant challenge in India's quest to achieve its potential GDP. Inefficient bureaucracy and administrative bottlenecks can hinder the effective implementation of policies, leading to delays in projects, increased costs, and reduced productivity.  This negatively impacts the overall economic efficiency and growth potential.

Statement 2 is an overgeneralization. While high population density can put pressure on resources and infrastructure, leading to lower per capita income in some cases, it is not an automatic barrier to economic growth.  Countries with high population density have demonstrated significant economic success through effective resource management, technological advancements, and efficient economic policies.  The relationship between population density and economic growth is complex and context-dependent.


**1. With reference to the Mahalanobis Plan Model, consider the following statements:**

1.  The model prioritized the development of heavy industries, characterized by capital-intensive production methods.
2.  A primary objective of the model was to rapidly eliminate unemployment within a short timeframe.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Mahalanobis Plan, adopted in India during the mid-1950s, was a centrally planned economic strategy.  Its core tenet was the prioritization of heavy industries.  This was based on the belief that these industries, while capital-intensive and potentially employing fewer people initially, would form the foundation for future industrial growth and diversification. The emphasis was on building the capacity to produce capital goods (machines that make other machines), thereby creating a self-reliant industrial base. This strategy differed significantly from approaches that focused on immediate consumer goods production or employment generation as the primary goal.  Therefore, statement 1 accurately reflects a central feature of the Mahalanobis model.

Statement 2, however, is incorrect. While the Mahalanobis Plan aimed to stimulate economic growth, which could indirectly lead to job creation, it did not prioritize rapid unemployment reduction as a primary, immediate objective.  The long-term vision of industrial development was deemed more crucial.  The model's focus on capital-intensive industries, rather than labor-intensive ones, meant that immediate employment gains might be limited.  This long-term perspective, focusing on building industrial capacity before immediate employment gains, is a key characteristic distinguishing the Mahalanobis model from alternative development strategies.  The potential for long-term employment growth was acknowledged, but it was not the immediate, overriding priority.


**2. With reference to the classification of the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian economy is accurately characterized as a food-surplus economy, consistently exceeding domestic food requirements.
2.  Given its large population, India's economy is correctly classified as a labor-surplus economy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India has made significant strides in agricultural production, classifying it as a food-surplus economy is an oversimplification.  Food security remains a significant challenge, with issues of regional disparities, unequal distribution, and vulnerability to fluctuations in agricultural output. While overall production may be sufficient, ensuring equitable access to food for all segments of the population is an ongoing concern.  The existence of malnutrition and hunger highlights the limitations of characterizing India solely as a food-surplus economy.

Statement 2 is correct. India possesses a large and relatively young population, resulting in a substantial labor supply that exceeds the available employment opportunities in many sectors. This labor surplus is a defining characteristic of the Indian economy, influencing wage levels, unemployment rates, and the overall structure of the labor market.  The presence of underemployment and disguised unemployment further underscores the labor surplus condition. This surplus significantly impacts economic policies related to employment generation, skill development, and income distribution.


**3. With reference to the production possibility frontier (PPF), consider the following statements:**

1.  A point outside the PPF represents an unattainable combination of goods given current resources and technology.
2.  The PPF illustrates the various combinations of goods and services that can be produced with available resources and technology, assuming efficient resource allocation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The production possibility frontier (PPF) is a fundamental concept in economics illustrating the trade-offs inherent in resource allocation.  Statement 1 is correct because the PPF represents the maximum possible output combinations given the existing resources and technology. Any point *outside* the PPF signifies a level of production that cannot be achieved without increasing resource availability or technological advancement.  It represents an unattainable combination of goods and services.

Statement 2 is also correct. The PPF graphically demonstrates the various combinations of goods and services that an economy can produce efficiently, using its available resources and technology.  Each point on the curve represents an efficient allocation of resources—no more of one good can be produced without sacrificing the production of another.  The PPF is a valuable tool for analyzing opportunity costs, economic growth, and the choices faced by economies in allocating scarce resources.  Understanding the PPF is crucial for analyzing economic efficiency and potential growth trajectories.


**4. With reference to price elasticity of demand for an individual good, consider the following statements:**

1.  The availability of substitutes significantly influences the magnitude of price elasticity.
2.  The rate of income growth in the overall economy is a primary determinant of price elasticity for individual goods.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to changes in its price.  Statement 1 is correct.  The presence of readily available substitutes greatly impacts price elasticity. If close substitutes exist, consumers can easily switch to alternatives when the price of a particular good rises, making demand more elastic (sensitive to price changes).  Conversely, if few or no substitutes are available, demand will be less elastic (less sensitive to price changes), as consumers have fewer alternatives. The availability of substitutes is a key factor affecting a consumer's ability to adjust consumption in response to price fluctuations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While overall economic conditions, including income growth, can influence demand, they are not primary determinants of price elasticity *for individual goods*.  Income growth affects overall demand but not the responsiveness of demand for a specific good to its own price change. Price elasticity is primarily determined by factors specific to the good itself, such as the availability of substitutes, the proportion of income spent on the good, and the time horizon considered.  General economic conditions can influence demand, but they don't directly determine the price elasticity of a particular good.


**5. With reference to the characteristics of money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money must be easily divisible into smaller units to facilitate transactions of varying values.
2.  For something to be considered money, it must have a higher value in alternative uses compared to its value as money.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Money serves several crucial functions in an economy, and its characteristics are essential for its effective operation.  Statement 1 is correct. Divisibility is a key characteristic of money.  It must be easily divisible into smaller units to facilitate transactions of various sizes.  Without divisibility, conducting transactions involving smaller amounts would be impractical. This allows for flexibility and efficiency in the exchange of goods and services.  The ability to divide money into smaller denominations is crucial for the smooth functioning of a market economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A crucial characteristic of money is that its value as a medium of exchange must be widely accepted. It does *not* require a higher value in alternative uses.  If a commodity had a higher value in alternative uses, it would be more likely to be used for those purposes rather than as a medium of exchange. The very nature of money is its acceptance as a medium of exchange regardless of its value in other applications.  The primary function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value, not to be the most valuable commodity in alternative uses.


**6. With reference to Adam Smith's concept of the "invisible hand," consider the following statements:**

1.  Adam Smith used the term "invisible hand" to refer to the role of government intervention in regulating markets.
2.  Adam Smith's "invisible hand" refers to the self-regulating nature of the market mechanism, coordinating individual actions for the overall economic benefit.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Adam Smith's concept of the "invisible hand" is a cornerstone of classical economics and free-market principles.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  Smith did *not* use the term "invisible hand" to describe government intervention.  In fact, his concept emphasizes the opposite—the ability of free markets to function efficiently without extensive government control. The invisible hand describes the unintended social benefits resulting from individual actions in a free market.

Statement 2 is correct. Smith argued that individuals pursuing their self-interest in a free market, guided by prices and competition, unintentionally contribute to the overall welfare of society.  The "invisible hand" refers to this self-regulating mechanism, where individual actions, driven by self-interest, lead to socially beneficial outcomes.  This concept is a central element in the argument for free markets and limited government intervention in economic affairs.  Understanding the "invisible hand" is crucial for comprehending classical economic thought and its implications for policy.


**7. With reference to the Law of Diminishing Returns, consider the following statements:**

1.  The law states that as more units of a variable input are added to a fixed input, holding other factors constant, there will be a point beyond which the marginal product of the variable input will begin to decline.
2.  The law of diminishing returns implies that average revenue will invariably diminish as more units of variable input are used.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Law of Diminishing Returns is a fundamental principle in economics that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs in production. Statement 1 is correct. This is a precise statement of the law. As more units of a variable input are added to a fixed input (e.g., adding more workers to a fixed amount of machinery), initially, the marginal product (additional output from each additional unit of input) increases. However, there will be a point beyond which adding more of the variable input will lead to a diminishing marginal product – each additional unit of input contributes less and less to total output. This is due to the limitations imposed by the fixed input.  The law doesn't negate increasing returns to scale, but it addresses the marginal productivity of a variable input relative to a fixed one.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The law of diminishing returns focuses on marginal *product*, not average *revenue*. While diminishing marginal product can impact revenue, it does not directly imply that average revenue (total revenue divided by quantity) will always diminish. Average revenue is influenced by various market factors, such as price and demand elasticity, which are distinct from the production function addressed by the law of diminishing returns.  The relationship between marginal product and average revenue is complex and depends on other market conditions.


**8. With reference to the Indian economy's growth and development, consider the following statements:**

1.  A significant increase in absolute and per capita real GNP does not necessarily indicate higher economic development if poverty and unemployment rates are rising concurrently.
2.  Despite high savings rates, capital formation may not translate into significant output increases if the capital-output ratio is high.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Economic growth, measured by increases in GNP, is not the sole indicator of development.  Statement 1 is correct.  While increases in absolute and per capita real GNP indicate an expansion in the economy's output, they don't fully capture the overall well-being of the population.  If poverty and unemployment are rising simultaneously, it suggests that the benefits of economic growth are not being distributed equitably or are not creating sufficient employment opportunities.  Genuine development requires not only economic growth but also improvements in social indicators such as poverty reduction, health, education, and environmental sustainability.  Therefore, simply looking at GNP growth can be misleading without considering broader development indicators.

Statement 2 is also correct. The capital-output ratio measures the amount of capital required to produce one unit of output.  A high capital-output ratio implies that a large investment in capital is needed to generate only a small increase in output. This can result from various factors, such as technological inefficiencies, poor resource allocation, or inadequate infrastructure.  High savings and capital formation are necessary but not sufficient conditions for high economic growth.  The efficiency of capital utilization, reflected in the capital-output ratio, significantly influences the translation of investment into output increases.  Therefore, a high capital-output ratio can negate the positive impact of high savings and capital formation.


**9. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPI assigns a higher weight to food items compared to the WPI.
2.  Unlike the WPI, the CPI incorporates changes in the prices of services.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The CPI and WPI are both measures of inflation, but they differ in their methodology and coverage.  Statement 1 is correct. The CPI (Consumer Price Index) typically gives a higher weight to food items compared to the WPI (Wholesale Price Index). This reflects the larger share of household spending dedicated to food, especially in developing economies. The CPI aims to measure the change in the cost of a basket of goods and services consumed by households, and food is a significant component of that basket.  The difference in weighting reflects the differing purposes of these indices.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The CPI is designed to capture changes in the prices of goods and services consumed by households, including services like healthcare, education, and transportation. The WPI, on the other hand, primarily focuses on the prices of goods at the wholesale level, typically excluding services.  This difference in scope reflects the different target audiences and uses of these price indices. The CPI provides a better measure of inflation's impact on consumers, while the WPI reflects price changes at the producer level.


**10. With reference to market demand for a good, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the price of a substitute good will lead to an increase in the demand for the original good.
2.  If a good is an inferior good, an increase in consumer income will lead to a decrease in its demand.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Market demand reflects the total quantity of a good that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a given price.  Statement 1 is correct. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of each other.  If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will likely switch to the relatively cheaper original good, increasing its demand.  This substitution effect is a key factor influencing market demand. The higher price of the substitute makes the original good more attractive.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Inferior goods are those for which demand decreases as consumer income increases. This is because consumers tend to substitute inferior goods with superior goods as their income rises.  As income increases, consumers generally prefer to buy higher-quality or more desirable goods, reducing their demand for inferior goods.  This inverse relationship between income and demand is a defining characteristic of inferior goods.


**11. With reference to the Indian economy's exchange rate, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates a depreciation of the rupee.
2.  An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates a decline in the country's trade competitiveness.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Exchange rates play a crucial role in international trade and the Indian economy's interaction with the global market.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  NEER (Nominal Effective Exchange Rate) is an index reflecting the value of a currency relative to a basket of other currencies.  An *increase* in NEER indicates an *appreciation* of the domestic currency (in this case, the rupee) because it can buy more of other currencies.  A decrease in NEER indicates depreciation.  This is a fundamental concept in international finance.  The direction of the change in NEER is directly related to the change in the value of the currency.

Statement 2 is correct.  REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate) adjusts the NEER for differences in inflation rates between countries.  An *increase* in REER indicates that domestic goods have become relatively *more expensive* compared to foreign goods, making the country *less* competitive in international trade.  This is because the real exchange rate considers the purchasing power of the currency, which is affected by inflation.  A higher REER signals a loss of competitiveness, potentially leading to a decline in exports and an increase in imports.  Understanding the difference between NEER and REER is critical for analyzing a country's external competitiveness.


**12. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Investment in health is considered a crucial source of human capital formation, contributing to a healthier and more productive workforce.
2. On-the-job training provided by firms is not considered a significant source of human capital formation as it benefits primarily the firms and not the individuals.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Human capital formation refers to the process of enhancing the knowledge, skills, and capabilities of individuals, leading to increased productivity and economic growth. Statement 1 is correct. Investment in health is a critical component of human capital formation.  A healthy population is more productive and less prone to illness and absenteeism.  Expenditures on healthcare, including preventive and curative medicine, improve the overall health and well-being of individuals and enhance their capacity to contribute to the economy. This investment enhances the productivity and efficiency of the labor force.

Statement 2 is incorrect. On-the-job training is indeed a significant source of human capital formation. While firms benefit from increased worker productivity, the individuals also gain valuable skills and experience that increase their future earning potential.  This type of training enhances the human capital of the workers, making them more valuable in the labor market.  Therefore, on-the-job training is a mutually beneficial investment for both firms and individuals, contributing to overall human capital development.  Ignoring this source of human capital formation leads to an incomplete understanding of the forces that influence human capital growth.


**13. With reference to the Indian economy's structural bottlenecks during the period 1950-1991, consider the following statements:**

1. The License Raj, while intending to promote planned investment and protect small-scale industries, ultimately hindered competition, entrepreneurship, and economic growth.
2. The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act of 1969 successfully prevented the concentration of wealth and promoted fair competition among businesses.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The period between 1950 and 1991 in India was characterized by a system of controls and regulations that significantly impacted the economy's structure and performance.  Statement 1 is correct. The License Raj, a system of extensive government licensing and controls on industrial activity, was intended to promote planned development, prevent monopolies, and protect small-scale industries. However, its implementation created bureaucratic hurdles, stifled competition, and discouraged innovation. The system often favored established businesses and hindered the entry of new entrepreneurs, ultimately hindering economic growth.  The complexity and delays associated with obtaining licenses created inefficiencies and discouraged investment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MRTP (Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices) Act of 1969 aimed to curb monopolies and promote fair competition. However, its implementation was often criticized for hindering the growth of large businesses, limiting their expansion, and inadvertently stifling competition.  The act's rigid restrictions on large companies prevented them from achieving economies of scale and innovating, thereby hindering overall industrial growth. The act was eventually repealed in 1991 as it was viewed as counterproductive to economic growth and development.


**14. With reference to the economic reforms of 1991 (LPG reforms), consider the following statements:**

1. Liberalization involved the removal of state restrictions on private activities to foster greater competition and efficiency.
2. Privatization primarily aimed at transferring public sector units (PSUs) to the private sector to increase their efficiency and productivity.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The economic reforms of 1991, often referred to as LPG reforms (Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization), were a landmark event in India's economic history.  Statement 1 is correct. Liberalization involved a significant reduction in government controls and regulations on private sector activities.  This included deregulation of industries, reduction of licensing requirements, and a move towards greater market-based decision-making. The goal was to increase competition, efficiency, and investment in the economy.  Liberalization was a key component of the reforms aimed at creating a more market-oriented economy.

Statement 2 is also correct. Privatization involved the transfer of ownership and management of public sector units (PSUs) to the private sector.  The rationale was that private sector management would be more efficient and productive, leading to improved performance and profitability of these enterprises.  Privatization was a significant element of the 1991 reforms aimed at improving efficiency and resource allocation in the economy.  While it had both proponents and critics, it remains a key part of the reforms.


**15.  With reference to the concept of inclusive growth, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth focuses solely on accelerating the pace of economic growth, regardless of its distributional impact.
2.  Inclusive growth prioritizes equitable distribution of growth benefits and ensuring equal opportunities for all segments of the population.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Inclusive growth is a development strategy that aims to create a more equitable and just society alongside economic expansion.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  Inclusive growth is not solely about rapid economic growth; it's about *how* that growth is achieved and shared.  It explicitly addresses the distributional aspects of growth, ensuring that the benefits reach all sections of society, particularly the marginalized and vulnerable.  Focusing only on the pace of growth without considering equity can lead to increased inequality and social unrest.

Statement 2 is correct.  Inclusive growth aims to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are widely shared, creating opportunities for all members of society regardless of their background or social status.  It emphasizes equal access to resources, education, healthcare, and other essential services.  This approach contrasts with growth models that focus solely on aggregate economic figures without considering the distributional consequences.  Inclusive growth is a more holistic approach to development, aiming for both economic progress and social justice.


**16. With reference to poverty alleviation programs in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The growth-oriented approach to poverty reduction, prevalent in the 1950s and early 1960s, assumed that the benefits of economic growth would automatically trickle down to the poor.
2.  Programs focused on generating incremental assets and work, such as the Food for Work program, were introduced as an alternative strategy to address poverty directly.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India has implemented various poverty alleviation programs over the years, evolving its strategies based on experience and changing economic circumstances.  Statement 1 is correct.  In the initial years of planning, the dominant approach assumed that rapid economic growth would automatically benefit the poor through a "trickle-down" effect.  This approach focused on overall economic expansion, believing that the gains would eventually reach the poorer sections of society.  This was a common assumption in early development strategies, but it was later found to be inadequate for addressing poverty effectively.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The limitations of the growth-oriented approach led to the implementation of programs that directly targeted poverty reduction through asset creation and work generation. The Food for Work program, for example, provided employment and food security to the poor.  These programs aimed to create immediate benefits for the poor, supplementing the income-generating effects of economic growth.  The shift to more targeted poverty alleviation programs reflected a recognition that economic growth alone is insufficient to address the complex issue of poverty.


**17. With reference to the "Paradox of Thrift," consider the following statements:**

1. The paradox states that if individuals in an economy increase their savings rate, the aggregate savings of the economy will automatically increase proportionately.
2. The paradox illustrates that an increase in the propensity to save can lead to a decrease in aggregate income and potentially leave aggregate savings unchanged or even lower.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Paradox of Thrift is a counterintuitive concept in macroeconomics that highlights the complexities of aggregate economic behavior.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Paradox of Thrift demonstrates that an increase in individual savings rates does *not* automatically translate into a proportional increase in aggregate savings for the economy as a whole.   This is because increased saving reduces aggregate demand, leading to decreased production and income, thereby offsetting the increase in savings.  The reduction in income can potentially lower overall savings.

Statement 2 is correct. The paradox shows that if everyone attempts to save more, the resulting decrease in aggregate demand can lead to lower overall income and potentially leave aggregate savings unchanged or even reduced. This is because the decrease in spending reduces business investment and production, ultimately impacting overall income and the level of aggregate savings.  This paradox highlights the interdependence of individual actions and aggregate economic outcomes.  It emphasizes the importance of considering the macroeconomic implications of individual decisions.


**1. With reference to the concepts of ex ante and ex post variables in macroeconomics, consider the following statements:**

1. Ex ante investment refers to the planned investment by firms, while ex post investment represents the actual investment realized at the end of a period, which may differ due to unforeseen changes in demand.

2. Ex ante consumption is the planned consumption expenditure by households, determined primarily by disposable income and the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), while ex post consumption represents the actual consumption expenditure during a period.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the distinction between ex ante and ex post variables in macroeconomic analysis.  Ex ante values represent planned or intended economic activities, while ex post values represent the actual realized outcomes.  Statement 1 correctly describes ex ante and ex post investment.  Firms may plan a certain level of investment (ex ante), but unexpected changes in market demand or other unforeseen circumstances can lead to a different actual investment level (ex post).  The discrepancy arises because ex ante investment is based on anticipated conditions, which may not perfectly align with the actual economic realities. Similarly, statement 2 correctly explains the difference between ex ante and ex post consumption. Households may plan to consume a certain amount based on their disposable income and consumption habits (ex ante), but unforeseen events or changes in income can alter their actual consumption (ex post).  The MPC plays a crucial role in determining planned consumption, but other factors influence the actual consumption level. Therefore, the correct answer is (c), as both statements correctly define and differentiate between ex ante and ex post variables for investment and consumption.


**2. With reference to the multiplier effect in a simple Keynesian model, consider the following statements:**

1. The autonomous expenditure multiplier demonstrates that an initial increase in autonomous spending (like government expenditure or investment) leads to a larger overall increase in aggregate output and income due to the cyclical nature of spending and income generation.

2. The size of the multiplier is inversely related to the marginal propensity to save (MPS); a higher MPS implies a smaller multiplier effect, as a larger portion of any income increase is saved rather than spent, thus dampening the cyclical effect.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of the multiplier effect within a simple Keynesian framework. Statement 1 correctly explains the fundamental principle of the multiplier. An initial injection of autonomous spending into the economy creates a ripple effect.  This initial spending becomes income for someone else, who then spends a portion of it, generating further income, and so on.  This cyclical process of spending and income generation leads to a total increase in aggregate output and income that is larger than the initial injection. The multiplier magnifies the impact of the initial autonomous spending.  Statement 2 also correctly identifies the inverse relationship between the MPS and the multiplier.  The MPS represents the proportion of additional income that households save.  A higher MPS means that a smaller proportion of any income increase is spent, reducing the subsequent rounds of spending and income generation. This smaller proportion of respending directly reduces the magnitude of the multiplier effect.  Therefore, a higher MPS leads to a smaller multiplier, while a lower MPS leads to a larger multiplier. The correct option is (c) because both statements accurately reflect the workings of the multiplier effect.


**3. With reference to the Paradox of Thrift, consider the following statements:**

1. The Paradox of Thrift highlights the counterintuitive idea that an increase in the overall saving rate within an economy can lead to a decrease in aggregate savings.

2. This paradox arises primarily because increased individual saving reduces aggregate demand, leading to a contraction in economic output and overall income, thus potentially offsetting or even exceeding the initial increase in saving.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Paradox of Thrift is a crucial concept in Keynesian economics.  Statement 1 correctly captures its essence:  a simultaneous increase in individual saving propensities can paradoxically reduce aggregate saving.  This seeming contradiction arises because of the interconnectedness of individual actions and aggregate outcomes.  Statement 2 correctly explains the mechanism behind this paradox.  If everyone attempts to save more, aggregate demand falls because less is spent on consumption and investment. This reduced demand leads firms to cut back on production, resulting in lower overall income levels.  The reduction in income then leads to a decrease in overall saving, potentially offsetting or even reversing the initial increase in intended saving. This is because the income effect of reduced aggregate demand outweighs the individual increase in savings rate. Therefore, the combined effect of increased individual saving behavior can be a lower level of overall savings, making (c) the correct answer.


**4. With reference to the components of the government budget, consider the following statements:**

1. Revenue receipts include tax revenues (direct and indirect taxes) and non-tax revenues (interest receipts, dividends, fees, etc.), while capital receipts represent funds raised through borrowing or disinvestment.

2. Revenue expenditure comprises government spending that does not create assets (e.g., salaries, subsidies, interest payments), while capital expenditure involves spending that creates assets (e.g., infrastructure projects, investments).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately delineate the components of a government budget. Statement 1 correctly classifies revenue receipts.  Tax revenues are a major source of government funding, encompassing direct taxes (like income tax) and indirect taxes (like sales tax). Non-tax revenues represent income from sources other than taxation, including interest earned on government investments, dividends from public sector undertakings, and fees for services. Capital receipts, on the other hand, represent the inflow of funds that increase the government’s liabilities, such as borrowings from the public or external sources or receipts from disinvestment (sale of government assets). Statement 2 correctly differentiates between revenue and capital expenditure. Revenue expenditure is spending that doesn't create any physical or financial assets; it supports the day-to-day functioning of the government.  This includes salaries of government employees, subsidies provided to various sectors, and interest payments on government debt. Capital expenditure, conversely, is investment in assets that increase the productive capacity of the economy. This includes investment in infrastructure like roads, bridges, and other public works, as well as investments in government-owned companies. Option (c) is correct as both statements accurately describe the components of a government budget.


**5. With reference to the differences between microeconomics and macroeconomics, consider the following statements:**

1. Microeconomics focuses on the behavior of individual economic agents (consumers, firms) and their interactions in specific markets, while macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole, analyzing aggregate variables like national income, inflation, and unemployment.

2. While microeconomics assumes that macroeconomic factors (like inflation) are given and unchanging for individual decision-making, macroeconomics explicitly analyzes how these aggregate factors affect individual economic agents and the economy's overall performance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately capture the fundamental distinctions between microeconomics and macroeconomics.  Statement 1 correctly defines the scope of each field. Microeconomics analyzes the behavior of individual economic units—consumers making purchasing decisions, firms determining production levels, and individual markets responding to changes in supply and demand. Macroeconomics, in contrast, takes a broader perspective, focusing on the overall performance of the economy. It examines aggregate indicators like GDP, inflation rates, unemployment rates, and the overall balance of payments. Statement 2 highlights a crucial difference in their approach. Microeconomic models often treat macroeconomic variables as exogenous (external factors that are taken as given). Microeconomic analysis may assume a constant inflation rate or a fixed level of national income when studying individual market behavior. In contrast, macroeconomics explicitly examines how these aggregate variables are determined and how they influence the behavior of individual economic units. For example, macroeconomic analysis would investigate how changes in the money supply affect inflation and, subsequently, consumer spending.  Option (c) is correct as both statements accurately represent the fundamental differences between the two branches of economics.


**6. With reference to the circular flow of income, consider the following statements:**

1. The circular flow model depicts the continuous interaction between households and firms, with households providing factor services (labor, capital, land) to firms in exchange for factor payments (wages, rent, interest, profit).

2. In a simplified model without savings or government intervention, the total value of goods and services produced (GDP) equals the total factor payments received by households, representing a closed-loop system where income earned is fully spent on domestically produced goods and services.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The circular flow of income is a fundamental macroeconomic concept. Statement 1 correctly describes the core interaction between households and firms. Households supply the factors of production (labor, capital, land, and entrepreneurship) which are essential inputs for firms to produce goods and services. In return, firms make factor payments to households—wages for labor, rent for land, interest for capital, and profit for entrepreneurship. This exchange of factor services and factor payments forms the basic circular flow. Statement 2 accurately depicts a simplified version of the model. In a closed economy without savings, taxes, or government spending, the total value of goods and services produced (GDP) is exactly equal to the total factor payments received by households.  All income earned is spent on consumption, creating a closed loop where income earned becomes expenditure, and expenditure becomes income. This simplified model demonstrates the basic principle of the circular flow, showing the interconnectedness of production, income, and expenditure. Option (c) is correct, as both statements accurately describe the circular flow of income.  


**7. With reference to the determination of equilibrium output in the final goods market, consider the following statements:**

1. In a simple Keynesian model, equilibrium output occurs when planned aggregate demand (AD) for final goods equals planned aggregate supply (AS), which under the assumption of perfectly elastic supply at a given price level, is determined solely by AD.

2.  The equilibrium level of output can be affected by changes in autonomous expenditure (like investment or government spending) through the multiplier effect, where an increase in autonomous spending leads to a proportionally larger increase in equilibrium output.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the determination of equilibrium output in a simple Keynesian model of the final goods market.  Statement 1 correctly explains the condition for equilibrium. In the Keynesian model, equilibrium output is achieved when planned aggregate demand (AD) equals planned aggregate supply (AS).  This is because, under the assumption of a perfectly elastic aggregate supply curve (meaning that firms are willing to supply any quantity of goods at a given price level in the short run), the level of output is solely determined by the level of aggregate demand.  Firms will produce exactly the quantity of goods that they expect to sell. Statement 2 correctly explains how changes in autonomous expenditure affect equilibrium output.  Autonomous expenditure refers to spending that is not directly dependent on income, like investment spending or government purchases. A change in autonomous spending causes a change in aggregate demand, which then affects equilibrium output through the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect amplifies the initial change in autonomous spending, leading to a larger change in equilibrium output. For instance, an increase in government spending will increase AD, which will increase output, which will further increase income, which leads to further increases in consumption and hence AD. This process continues until a new equilibrium is reached. Option (c) is correct because both statements provide accurate descriptions of the equilibrium condition and the role of autonomous expenditure in a simplified Keynesian model.


**8. With reference to the measures of inflation, consider the following statements:**

1. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services, while the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) tracks changes in the prices of goods traded at the wholesale level.

2. The CPI typically gives a higher weight to food items compared to the WPI, and the CPI also includes services, unlike the WPI, leading to potential differences in their measured inflation rates.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key differences between the CPI and WPI, two important measures of inflation. Statement 1 accurately defines both indices. The CPI is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.  This basket includes a wide range of items, from food and clothing to housing and transportation. The WPI, on the other hand, measures the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output at the wholesale level. This basket focuses primarily on goods traded in bulk, excluding services. Statement 2 correctly points out a significant difference in their composition and weighting.  The CPI generally assigns a higher weight to food items because food constitutes a larger share of household budgets, especially for lower-income households.  The CPI also includes services (like healthcare and education), which are excluded from the WPI. These differences in composition and weighting lead to variations in the inflation rates reported by the CPI and WPI.  Option (c) is correct as both statements accurately describe the CPI and WPI and highlight their key differences.  The differences in weighting and inclusion of services often lead to discrepancies between CPI and WPI inflation rates.


**9. With reference to the impact of foreign income on a domestic economy, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in foreign income, holding other factors constant, leads to an increase in exports from the domestic economy, boosting aggregate demand and output through the multiplier effect.

2.  While an increase in foreign income stimulates exports and domestic output, a simultaneous large increase in imports could potentially offset the positive impact on the trade balance, possibly leading to a trade deficit.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the impact of changes in foreign income on a domestic open economy. Statement 1 correctly explains the positive impact of increased foreign income on a domestic economy. When foreign income rises, demand for domestically produced goods and services intended for export also increases. This rise in exports acts as an injection into the domestic economy's aggregate demand, stimulating production and employment. The multiplier effect further amplifies this initial increase in demand, leading to a larger overall increase in domestic output and income. Statement 2 correctly points out a potential offsetting factor. While increased foreign income boosts exports, it also typically leads to increased imports.  As domestic income rises due to increased export demand, the demand for imported goods and services also rises.  If this increase in imports is sufficiently large, it could partially or even completely offset the positive effect on the trade balance, potentially even leading to a trade deficit. The magnitude of this offset depends on the income elasticity of demand for imports (how much imports increase in response to an increase in income) and the size of the initial increase in foreign income.  Option (c) is the correct answer because both statements correctly depict the interconnectedness of domestic and foreign economies and the potential for both positive and negative effects on the trade balance.


**10. With reference to exchange rate changes and their effects, consider the following statements:**

1. A depreciation of the domestic currency (a fall in its value relative to other currencies) makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, potentially improving the trade balance in the long run.

2. A currency appreciation (a rise in its value) makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, which could negatively impact the trade balance and reduce domestic competitiveness in international markets.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the effects of exchange rate changes on a country's trade balance and international competitiveness. Statement 1 correctly explains the impact of currency depreciation. When a country's currency depreciates, its exports become cheaper for foreign buyers, making them more competitive in international markets. This increased competitiveness can lead to a rise in export demand and, consequently, an improvement in the trade balance. Simultaneously, imports become more expensive for domestic consumers, potentially reducing import demand. However, it's important to note that the impact on the trade balance may not be immediate, as it takes time for changes in exchange rates to fully affect trade flows. Statement 2 correctly describes the effects of currency appreciation.  When a country's currency appreciates, its exports become more expensive for foreign buyers, making them less competitive internationally. This reduced competitiveness can lead to a fall in export demand and a deterioration in the trade balance. Conversely, imports become cheaper for domestic consumers, potentially increasing import demand.  This can negatively impact domestic industries producing goods that compete with imports.  Therefore, option (c) is correct; both statements accurately describe the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on trade and competitiveness.  The time lag before the full effects are felt is an important nuance to consider.


**1. With reference to the components of aggregate income, consider the following statements:**

1. Personal Income (PI) is calculated by subtracting undistributed profits, net interest payments made by households, and corporate tax from National Income (NI), and then adding transfer payments to households from the government and firms.
2. Personal Disposable Income (PDI) is derived by deducting personal tax payments and non-tax payments from Personal Income (PI).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the calculation of Personal Income (PI) in national income accounting.  National Income represents the total income earned by factors of production within an economy.  To arrive at Personal Income, we must account for income not received by households. Undistributed profits (retained earnings of corporations), net interest payments made by households (interest paid exceeds interest received), and corporate taxes are all deducted from NI.  Conversely, transfer payments (e.g., social security benefits, unemployment benefits) made to households increase their disposable income and are thus added to NI.

Statement 2 correctly defines Personal Disposable Income (PDI).  PDI represents the actual income available for households to spend or save after all taxes and non-tax payments have been deducted from their personal income.  Personal tax payments include income tax, while non-tax payments encompass fines or other compulsory payments.  Therefore, PDI provides a more accurate picture of a household's spending power than PI.  Both statements are factual representations of macroeconomic accounting principles.


**2. With reference to macroeconomic multipliers, consider the following statements:**

1. Multipliers are higher when the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is low and the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is high.
2.  A low marginal propensity to invest will result in a lower multiplier effect.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The multiplier effect is directly related to the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). A higher MPC leads to a larger multiplier because increased income results in a greater increase in consumption, which further stimulates aggregate demand and economic activity. Conversely, a low MPC and high MPS diminish the multiplier effect.  The formula for the simple spending multiplier is 1/(1-MPC), demonstrating the inverse relationship between MPC and the multiplier's size.

Statement 2 is correct. Investment is a crucial component of aggregate demand. A low marginal propensity to invest means that an increase in income leads to a smaller increase in investment spending.  This reduces the overall multiplier effect because investment's contribution to the cumulative increase in aggregate demand is lessened.  Therefore, changes in investment significantly impact the size of the multiplier.


**3. With reference to the concept of price elasticity of demand, consider the following statements:**

1. When a fall in the price of a commodity leads to a decrease in total expenditure, the price elasticity of demand is less than one.
2.  If a rise in the price of a commodity increases total expenditure, the price elasticity of demand is greater than one.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price.  When demand is inelastic (less than one), a price decrease leads to a proportionally smaller increase in quantity demanded. Consequently, total expenditure (price x quantity) falls because the increase in quantity is outweighed by the decrease in price. This scenario describes an inelastic demand curve.

Statement 2 is also correct. When demand is elastic (greater than one), a price increase leads to a proportionally larger decrease in quantity demanded.  Total expenditure rises in this case because the reduction in quantity is less than the increase in price. This is characteristic of an elastic demand curve.  Both statements correctly relate changes in total expenditure to the elasticity of demand.


**4. With reference to aggregate demand in the context of loan waivers, consider the following statements:**

1. Loan waivers primarily impact aggregate demand through increased private consumption due to a rise in net private sector wealth.
2.  Loan waivers have a public sector impact through changes in government expenditure and taxes, but this impact is generally smaller than the private consumption effect.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Loan waivers directly increase the net wealth of farmers by reducing their debt burden. This increase in wealth boosts their disposable income, leading to higher private consumption expenditure. The magnitude of this effect depends on the size of the waiver and the marginal propensity to consume among farmers.  This increased consumption directly contributes to a rise in aggregate demand.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the primary impact of loan waivers is on private consumption, there are also public sector consequences.  The government's fiscal position is affected.  The waiver represents a reduction in government revenue (if loans are written off) or an increase in government expenditure (if the government compensates banks). These changes can further influence aggregate demand through the government's spending multiplier and tax multiplier effects.  However, the direct impact on private consumption is generally more significant.


**5. With reference to macroeconomic variables and their interrelationships, consider the following statements:**

1. Net National Product (NNP) at market prices is calculated by subtracting depreciation from Gross National Product (GNP).
2. National Income (NI) or NNP at factor cost is obtained by adjusting NNP at market prices for net indirect taxes (indirect taxes minus subsidies).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly defines the relationship between GNP and NNP. GNP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced by a nation's residents, regardless of location.  NNP accounts for the consumption of fixed capital (depreciation) during production, providing a more accurate measure of the net addition to a nation's wealth.  Subtracting depreciation from GNP gives NNP at market prices.

Statement 2 accurately describes the calculation of National Income (NI).  NNP at market prices includes indirect taxes (taxes on goods and services), which are not part of the income earned by factors of production. Subsidies, on the other hand, reduce the cost of production and thus increase the income accruing to the factors. Therefore, to arrive at NI (NNP at factor cost), net indirect taxes (indirect taxes minus subsidies) must be subtracted from NNP at market prices.  Both statements are fundamental concepts in national income accounting.


**6. With reference to the Paradox of Thrift, consider the following statements:**

1.  If all individuals in an economy simultaneously increase their savings rate, aggregate savings in the economy will necessarily increase.
2. The Paradox of Thrift highlights that an increase in the economy-wide savings rate can lead to a decrease in aggregate output and leave overall savings unchanged.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Paradox of Thrift illustrates a counterintuitive outcome.  While individual saving is beneficial, a simultaneous increase in the savings rate across the entire economy can negatively affect aggregate demand.  Reduced consumption due to increased saving decreases aggregate demand, causing firms to reduce output and investment. This decline in economic activity ultimately reduces overall income, potentially leading to no change or even a decrease in aggregate savings despite the individual efforts to save more.

Statement 2 correctly describes the core idea of the Paradox of Thrift.  Increased thriftiness, while individually rational, can lead to a contractionary effect on the economy as a whole. The reduction in aggregate demand caused by lower consumption outweighs the increase in individual savings, potentially resulting in unchanged or even lower overall savings for the economy. This paradox highlights the interconnectedness of individual actions and macroeconomic outcomes.


**7. With reference to the measurement of GDP, consider the following statements:**

1. Nominal GDP is calculated using current market prices, while real GDP uses constant prices from a base year.
2. The GDP deflator is the ratio of real GDP to nominal GDP and indicates changes in the price level.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly distinguishes between nominal and real GDP. Nominal GDP reflects the value of goods and services produced using current market prices, making it susceptible to inflation. Real GDP, in contrast, uses constant prices from a base year, isolating the impact of changes in the volume of production from price changes. This allows for a more accurate comparison of economic output across different time periods or countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GDP deflator is actually the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP, not the other way around.  It measures the overall price level in an economy relative to a base year.  A rising GDP deflator indicates inflation, while a falling deflator suggests deflation.  The formula is: GDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100.  The statement reverses the numerator and denominator, resulting in an incorrect definition.


**8. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPI measures the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of goods and services, while the WPI tracks changes in the prices of goods traded in bulk at the wholesale level.
2.  The CPI includes prices of imported goods, whereas the WPI generally does not.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly defines the scope of CPI and WPI. The CPI focuses on the price changes experienced by urban consumers for a representative basket of goods and services, reflecting the cost of living. The WPI, on the other hand, tracks price movements at the wholesale level, focusing on goods traded in bulk, often raw materials and intermediate goods.  The difference in their coverage reflects the different aspects of the economy each index aims to capture.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The CPI typically includes prices of both domestically produced and imported goods consumed by households. The WPI, however, primarily reflects the prices of goods traded within the domestic wholesale market, generally excluding imported goods.  This difference in scope is a crucial distinction between the two indices.  Both statements highlight essential differences in the construction and application of CPI and WPI.


**9. With reference to the relationship between national saving, investment, and the trade balance, consider the following statements:**

1.  In a closed economy, national saving is always equal to investment.
2. In an open economy, a trade surplus implies that national saving exceeds investment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In a closed economy, with no international trade, the national income identity simplifies to:  Y = C + I + G, where Y is national income, C is consumption, I is investment, and G is government spending.  National saving (S) is the difference between national income and consumption, S = Y – C.  Substituting this into the identity, we get S = I + G.  If we assume a balanced government budget (G = T, where T is taxes), then we have S = I, implying that national saving equals investment.

Statement 2 is also correct. In an open economy, the national income identity is: Y = C + I + G + X – M, where X is exports and M is imports.  National saving is still S = Y – C. The trade balance (NX) is equal to X – M.  Thus, the identity becomes S = I + G + NX.  If we again assume a balanced budget (G = T), then S = I + NX.  A trade surplus (NX > 0) means that exports exceed imports, implying that S > I; national saving is greater than investment.  The excess saving is used to finance the trade surplus.



**10.  With reference to fiscal policy and its impact on aggregate demand, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in government purchases directly increases aggregate demand, while a decrease in taxes indirectly increases aggregate demand through its effect on disposable income and consumption.
2. The government spending multiplier is always greater than the tax multiplier in absolute value.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Government purchases (G) are a direct component of aggregate demand (AD). An increase in G directly boosts AD. A tax cut increases disposable income (YD), leading to higher consumption spending (C) through the multiplier effect.  The increase in C indirectly raises AD. The magnitude of the increase in AD depends on the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).

Statement 2 is also correct. The government spending multiplier is given by 1/(1-MPC), while the tax multiplier is -MPC/(1-MPC). Since MPC is always between 0 and 1, the government spending multiplier is always greater than the tax multiplier in absolute terms.  This is because a change in government spending has a direct impact on AD, while a tax change affects AD indirectly through its influence on consumption.  Both statements accurately reflect the mechanisms of fiscal policy.


**11. With reference to the determination of equilibrium income in an open economy, consider the following statements:**

1. In an open economy, equilibrium income is determined where aggregate demand for domestic goods equals the aggregate supply of domestic goods.
2.  An increase in autonomous expenditure in an open economy leads to a smaller increase in equilibrium income compared to a closed economy due to the leakage of expenditure into imports.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In an open economy, aggregate demand (AD) includes domestic demand (consumption, investment, government spending) and net exports (exports minus imports). Equilibrium income is reached where AD equals aggregate supply (AS), representing the total output of an economy.  This equilibrium point determines the level of income and output in the economy.

Statement 2 is also correct. The open economy multiplier is smaller than the closed economy multiplier due to import leakage.  When autonomous expenditure increases, some of the increased demand falls on imported goods, reducing the impact on domestic output and income.  This leakage effect makes the multiplier smaller in an open economy compared to a closed economy.  Both statements accurately describe the mechanisms of income determination in an open economy.


**12. With reference to the methods of calculating national income, consider the following statements:**

1. The product method calculates national income by summing the value added at each stage of production across all firms in the economy.
2. The income method sums all factor incomes (wages, profits, rent, interest) earned within the economy during a given period.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the product method. This method avoids double counting by calculating the value added at each stage of production.  Value added is the difference between the value of output and the value of intermediate goods used in production. Summing the value added across all sectors of the economy yields the national income. This approach ensures that only the final value of goods and services is included in the national income calculation.

Statement 2 accurately describes the income method. This method sums all incomes earned by factors of production within the economy.  These factor incomes include wages and salaries, profits, rent, and interest.  By adding up all these incomes, we arrive at the national income, representing the total income generated within the economy.  This method is based on the principle that the total value of output must equal the total income generated in producing that output.  Both statements represent valid and commonly used methods for calculating national income.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the characteristics of capital goods, consider the following statements:**

1.  A capital good must be a produced durable output resulting from a man-made process.
2.  A capital good, while acting as an input, undergoes transformation or consumption during the production process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The text explicitly defines a capital good as a "produced durable output of a man-made process."  This emphasizes that it's created through human intervention and isn't a naturally occurring resource.  The durability aspect ensures its use over multiple production cycles.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text contradicts this assertion. It clarifies that a capital good, while acting as an input, does *not* get transformed or consumed during production.  Wear and tear is acknowledged, but this is a gradual process, distinct from immediate transformation or consumption within a single production cycle.  The key is that the capital good remains largely intact to be used repeatedly.  This understanding of capital goods is crucial for macroeconomic analysis, especially when considering investment and capital accumulation.  The distinction between a capital good and an intermediate good is essential here; intermediate goods are consumed during production, while capital goods are not.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the calculation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP):**

1.  The expenditure method calculates GDP by summing the final expenditures received by all firms in the economy, including consumption, investment, government spending, exports, and deducting imports.
2.  The value-added method calculates GDP by summing the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy, including intermediate goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the expenditure method of calculating GDP.  The text explicitly details this approach: adding up consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), exports (X), and subtracting imports (M) to arrive at GDP (GDP = C + I + G + X – M). This method focuses on the final demand for goods and services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The value-added method calculates GDP by summing the *value added* at each stage of production.  Crucially, it *excludes* intermediate goods to prevent double-counting.  The text emphasizes this point, illustrating how the value-added approach avoids including the cost of intermediate goods multiple times in the final GDP calculation. The value-added approach is a more precise way to measure the contribution of each sector to the overall GDP.


**3. With reference to the functions of money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money serves as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions without the need for a double coincidence of wants.
2.  Money solely functions as a store of value, ensuring wealth preservation but not facilitating transactions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a primary function of money. The text explicitly explains how money eliminates the need for a "double coincidence of wants" inherent in barter systems.  It acts as an intermediary, simplifying transactions and making exchange more efficient. This is a fundamental concept in macroeconomics, highlighting the role of money in facilitating economic activity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While money does serve as a store of value, it is not its *sole* function.  The text clearly states that money plays three crucial roles: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.  Restricting money's function to only a store of value ignores its critical role in facilitating transactions and providing a standardized unit for measuring economic value.


**4.  Consider the following statements concerning the components of the government budget:**

1.  Revenue receipts include tax revenues (direct and indirect taxes) and non-tax revenues (interest receipts, dividends, etc.).
2.  Revenue expenditure includes only those expenditures that result in the creation of physical or financial assets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the composition of revenue receipts in a government budget. The text explicitly details the inclusion of tax revenues (direct and indirect taxes) and non-tax revenues (like interest receipts, dividends, and fees). Understanding the sources of government revenue is essential for analyzing fiscal policy and its impact on the economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Revenue expenditure encompasses all government spending that *doesn't* create physical or financial assets. The text explains that revenue expenditure covers the normal functioning of government departments, interest payments on debt, and grants—even if some grants are intended for asset creation.  This distinction between revenue and capital expenditure is vital for comprehending the government's fiscal position and its impact on the economy.  Capital expenditure, in contrast, focuses on investments that yield future benefits.


**5. With reference to the concept of Gross National Product (GNP), consider the following statements:**

1.  GNP includes the factor income earned by domestic factors of production employed within the country's borders.
2.  GNP equals GDP plus net factor income from abroad (NFIA).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. GNP considers the income generated by domestic factors of production, regardless of their location (within or outside the country's borders).  This is a key distinction from GDP, which is limited to production within a country's geographical boundaries.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explicitly defines GNP as GDP plus net factor income from abroad (NFIA). NFIA represents the difference between factor income earned by domestic residents from abroad and factor income earned by foreign residents within the domestic economy.  This adjustment is crucial for a comprehensive measure of a nation's total income.  Understanding the difference between GDP and GNP is essential for analyzing a country's economic performance in a globalized world.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Paradox of Thrift:**

1.  An increase in the marginal propensity to save (MPS) leads to a proportional increase in total savings in the economy.
2. An increase in the marginal propensity to save (MPS) can lead to a decrease in aggregate demand and a decline in overall savings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Paradox of Thrift demonstrates that a collective increase in saving does *not* necessarily lead to a proportional increase in aggregate savings.  Increased thriftiness reduces consumption, decreasing aggregate demand. This lower demand subsequently leads to reduced production and income, ultimately resulting in either a decline or no change in overall savings.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Paradox of Thrift. The text explains how an increase in MPS (or a decrease in MPC) causes a downward swing of the aggregate demand line, leading to a decrease in equilibrium output. This lower output reduces income, and despite the higher MPS, the overall level of savings may not increase, or may even decrease.  This counter-intuitive result is a key concept in Keynesian economics.


**7. With reference to the multiplier effect, consider the following statements:**

1.  The multiplier effect describes how an initial change in autonomous spending leads to a larger change in aggregate output.
2. The size of the multiplier is inversely related to the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly explains the multiplier effect. The text details how an initial increase (or decrease) in autonomous expenditure (like investment) triggers a chain reaction, leading to a larger overall increase (or decrease) in aggregate output and income. This is a fundamental concept in Keynesian economics.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The size of the multiplier is *directly* related to the MPC. A higher MPC implies a larger multiplier effect because a greater proportion of any increase in income is spent on consumption, fueling further rounds of spending and production. The formula provided in the text (Multiplier = 1/(1-c) where c=MPC) shows this direct relationship. A lower MPC implies a smaller multiplier.


**8. Consider the following statements about macroeconomic variables:**

1.  Nominal GDP measures the value of goods and services produced in an economy using current prices, while Real GDP uses constant prices.
2.  An increase in Real GDP always indicates improved economic well-being for all citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately distinguishes between nominal and real GDP. The text explains that nominal GDP uses current market prices, reflecting both changes in quantity and prices, whereas real GDP uses constant (base-year) prices, isolating changes in the quantity of goods and services produced.  This distinction is vital for understanding economic growth and inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While an increase in real GDP generally indicates economic expansion, it doesn't guarantee improved well-being for *all* citizens.  Real GDP growth doesn't account for income distribution, poverty levels, environmental degradation, or other factors contributing to overall societal well-being.  A rise in real GDP could coexist with increased inequality, for example.  Therefore, real GDP is a limited indicator of overall societal progress.


Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to the specified format and criteria.  The difficulty level aims to be challenging, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. With reference to the determinants of equilibrium income in an open economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in government spending (G) shifts the aggregate demand (AD) curve upwards, leading to a larger increase in output than the increase in G due to the multiplier effect.
2.  In an open economy, the multiplier effect is smaller than in a closed economy because a portion of increased demand spills over into imports.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  An increase in government spending (G) directly boosts aggregate demand. This leads to a multiplier effect, where the initial increase in demand generates further increases in income and spending, resulting in a larger overall increase in output than the initial injection of G. This is a fundamental concept in Keynesian economics.

Statement 2 is also correct.  In an open economy, a portion of any increase in aggregate demand is directed towards imports, reducing the impact on domestic output. This leakage of demand into imports diminishes the multiplier effect compared to a closed economy where all increased demand is spent on domestically produced goods and services. The degree to which the multiplier is dampened depends on the economy's marginal propensity to import (MPM). A higher MPM results in a smaller multiplier.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding trade deficits, savings, and investment in an open economy:**

1.  In a closed economy, saving and investment must always be equal; however, in an open economy, they can differ.
2.  A trade deficit is always a cause for alarm, indicating an unsustainable economic situation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  In a closed economy, any saving must be matched by investment.  There is no external sector to absorb or provide funds.  However, in an open economy, a trade deficit (imports exceeding exports) allows investment to exceed saving, as the difference is financed by capital inflows from abroad. Conversely, a trade surplus allows saving to exceed investment. This fundamental difference between open and closed economies is crucial for understanding international capital flows.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A trade deficit is not inherently negative. While a persistent and large trade deficit might signal underlying problems like excessive consumption or low national saving, it can also reflect high investment, leading to future economic growth.  The cause of the deficit is crucial in determining its severity.  A deficit resulting from high investment is less concerning than one stemming from unsustainable consumption levels or government spending.  Analyzing the components of the current account is essential for a proper evaluation.


**3. With reference to the effects of changes in macroeconomic variables on an open economy, consider the following statements:**

1. A fall in domestic prices, holding foreign prices constant, will lead to a decrease in net exports and a decline in domestic output.
2.  A depreciation of the domestic currency (a fall in its value relative to other currencies) will make domestic goods cheaper for foreign buyers, increasing net exports and aggregate demand.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A fall in domestic prices, ceteris paribus (holding other things constant, including foreign prices), would make domestic goods more competitive internationally. This would lead to an increase in exports and, consequently, an increase in net exports and domestic output.  The opposite outcome stated in the statement is incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. Currency depreciation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, improving a country's trade balance. This leads to an increase in net exports and stimulates aggregate demand.  This is a key mechanism through which exchange rate adjustments affect a country's output and international competitiveness.  However, the effectiveness of exchange rate changes in influencing trade balances depends on various factors like price elasticity of demand for imports and exports, and the time lags involved in the response of trade flows.


**4. With reference to the components of the government budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Revenue receipts include tax revenues (direct and indirect taxes) and non-tax revenues (interest receipts, dividends, etc.).
2. Revenue expenditure includes spending on the creation of physical or financial assets.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Revenue receipts represent the government's income from various sources. Tax revenues are a major component, comprising direct taxes (like income tax and corporate tax) and indirect taxes (like excise duty, customs duty, and GST).  Non-tax revenues include earnings from government investments, fees for services, and other miscellaneous sources.  This is a crucial aspect of fiscal policy and public finance management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Revenue expenditure refers to government spending that does not lead to the creation of assets.  It covers day-to-day administrative expenses, interest payments on government debt, subsidies, and grants.  Expenditure on asset creation (like infrastructure projects) falls under capital expenditure.  The distinction between revenue and capital expenditure is essential for understanding the government's fiscal position and its impact on the economy.


**5. Consider the following statements about the functions of money:**

1.  Money serves as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions and eliminating the need for barter.
2.  Money acts as a store of value, preserving purchasing power over time, but its value is always perfectly stable.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The primary function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange, simplifying transactions and overcoming the limitations of barter systems (which require a double coincidence of wants). This is fundamental to the functioning of modern economies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While money does function as a store of value, preserving purchasing power until it is spent, its value is not perfectly stable. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money over time.  The rate at which this happens varies depending on macroeconomic factors and monetary policy.  Other assets can also serve as a store of value, sometimes offering better protection against inflation than money.  The stability of a currency's value is a key concern for central banks.


**6. With reference to the calculation of India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), consider the following statements:**

1.  Before 2015, India's GDP was primarily calculated at market prices, incorporating indirect taxes and subsidies.
2.  Since 2015, India has adopted the expenditure method as the sole method for GDP calculation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Before 2015, India's GDP was calculated at factor cost (basic prices), excluding indirect taxes and subsidies. The shift to market prices in 2015 brought India's GDP calculation in line with international standards.  This change significantly affected the reported GDP figures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the expenditure method is a primary method used for GDP calculation globally and in India, it's not the sole method. Multiple methods, including the income method and the product method, are used to calculate and cross-check GDP figures. The use of multiple methods helps in ensuring accuracy and consistency in GDP estimations.


**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the Paradox of Thrift:**

1. The paradox of thrift suggests that if all individuals in an economy increase their saving rate, aggregate saving in the economy will necessarily increase.
2.  A decrease in the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) leads to a decrease in the slope of the aggregate demand (AD) curve, resulting in a lower equilibrium output.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Paradox of Thrift highlights the counterintuitive idea that a simultaneous increase in saving by all individuals can lead to a decrease in aggregate saving. This is because the reduction in aggregate demand caused by decreased consumption can lead to lower overall income and investment, potentially offsetting the increase in individual saving rates.  It’s a crucial macroeconomic concept demonstrating the interconnectedness of consumption, saving, and aggregate demand.

Statement 2 is correct. A lower MPC (meaning a higher marginal propensity to save) reduces the responsiveness of consumption to changes in income. This results in a flatter AD curve.  A flatter AD curve implies that any change in autonomous spending will have a smaller effect on equilibrium output.  The multiplier effect, which amplifies changes in aggregate demand, is smaller with a lower MPC.


**8. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Investment in education is a primary source of human capital formation, increasing future income and productivity.
2.  Expenditures on health, on-the-job training, and migration are not considered significant sources of human capital formation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Investment in education is a fundamental driver of human capital formation.  It equips individuals with knowledge and skills, enhancing their productivity and earning potential.  Education is considered a crucial factor in economic growth and development.  The returns to education, in terms of increased wages and improved job opportunities, are well-documented.  Governments invest heavily in education systems to build human capital.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Expenditures on health, on-the-job training, and migration are all significant contributors to human capital formation.  A healthy workforce is more productive. On-the-job training enhances skills and productivity. Migration can lead to better job opportunities and higher earnings.  These factors all contribute to the overall stock of human capital, which is a key determinant of a nation's economic performance.  Ignoring these elements would present an incomplete picture of human capital development.


**9. Consider the following statements about the circular flow of income:**

1. In a simple economy without government or external sectors, total factor payments (wages, rent, interest, profit) equal the total value of goods and services produced (GDP).
2. Savings in the economy are always equal to investment in the economy, even in the presence of government and foreign trade.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  In a closed economy with no government intervention, the total value of goods and services produced (GDP) is distributed as factor payments to those who contributed to the production process (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship). This is a fundamental principle of the circular flow of income.  It highlights the interconnectedness of production and income distribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While in a closed economy without a government, savings equal investment, this equality does not hold in the presence of government and foreign trade.  Government spending and net exports (exports minus imports) affect the relationship between savings and investment.  The identity I - S = (G - T) + (X - M) shows how these factors influence the overall balance. This is a key difference between closed and open economy models.


**10. With reference to the measurement of GDP, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nominal GDP measures the value of goods and services produced using current market prices, while real GDP uses constant prices from a base year to isolate changes in quantity.
2.  An increase in nominal GDP always indicates an improvement in the standard of living.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nominal GDP is calculated using current-year prices, while real GDP uses constant prices from a base year. This adjustment removes the effect of inflation, allowing for a clearer picture of economic growth in terms of the actual quantity of goods and services produced.  Real GDP is a more accurate measure of changes in output than nominal GDP.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An increase in nominal GDP does not automatically mean an improvement in living standards.  If nominal GDP rises due solely to inflation, while real GDP remains stagnant or falls, living standards would likely decline.  Real GDP per capita (real GDP divided by the population) is a more reliable indicator of changes in living standards.  Other factors, such as income distribution and environmental sustainability, also play a crucial role in determining overall well-being.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the sources of Human Capital in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Investment in health, encompassing preventive medicine, curative medicine, and social medicine, significantly contributes to human capital formation by increasing the supply of a healthy workforce.
2.  Expenditure on migration, while involving costs like transportation and adjustment to new environments, is a source of human capital formation as the increased earnings in new locations outweigh these costs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of human capital formation in India as discussed in the provided text.

Statement 1 correctly identifies investments in health as a crucial component of human capital.  The text explicitly mentions preventive, curative, and social medicine as contributing to a healthier workforce and, consequently, increased productivity.  A healthy population is more productive, leading to higher economic output and national development.  This aligns directly with the economic understanding of human capital as an investment.

Statement 2 also holds true. The text details how migration, although involving costs, can contribute to human capital formation.  Individuals migrate in search of better job opportunities and higher salaries.  The net effect, as explained, is an increase in earnings that surpasses the costs of relocation. This increased earning capacity represents a clear gain in human capital. The increased income and potential for skill development in new environments contribute to overall human capital growth.

Therefore, the correct option is (c) Both 1 and 2.


**2. With reference to the concept of Human Capital Formation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Investment in education is the sole significant source of human capital formation, significantly impacting an individual's future income and overall societal development.
2.  On-the-job training, undertaken by firms to enhance worker skills, is considered a source of human capital formation because the enhanced productivity resulting from the training exceeds its cost.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While investment in education is a *major* source of human capital, the text explicitly mentions other sources such as health, on-the-job training, migration, and information acquisition.  To state it is the *sole* significant source is a misrepresentation of the multifaceted nature of human capital formation.  A holistic approach to human development considers numerous factors contributing to an individual's productive capacity.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that firms invest in on-the-job training, and this is considered a source of human capital formation because the return (in the form of enhanced productivity) exceeds the cost of the training.  This is a fundamental economic principle:  investments in human capital are worthwhile if the resulting increase in productivity justifies the initial investment.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the appropriate answer.


**3. With reference to the Indian economy's composition of national income, consider the following statements:**

1. The share of the manufacturing sector in India's national income has experienced a significant increase in recent years, reflecting the nation's industrial growth.
2.  The share of the services sector in India's national income has witnessed a sharp increase, surpassing the contributions of other sectors.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text mentions a shift in the composition of India’s national income.  Let's analyze the statements:

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the share of the manufacturing sector has *declined*. This is a significant point reflecting challenges in India's industrial development and the need for structural reforms to boost manufacturing's contribution to the national economy.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly notes a *sharp increase* in the share of the services sector in India's national income. This highlights the growing importance of the services sector in the Indian economy, a trend observed in many developing nations.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.


**4. With reference to the concept of  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of a similar basket of goods and services in different countries, adjusting for differences in cost of living.
2.  Based on PPP, India consistently ranks among the top five largest economies globally, reflecting its substantial economic output.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text clearly defines PPP exchange rates as being calculated by comparing prices of similar baskets of goods and services across countries. This comparison adjusts for differences in the cost of living between nations, providing a more accurate picture of relative economic size than nominal exchange rates.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states that in terms of PPP dollars, India is the *sixth* largest economy in the world (not among the top five). This highlights the discrepancy between nominal GDP and PPP-adjusted GDP, a crucial point in understanding global economic comparisons.  The fact that India's ranking differs based on the measure used reflects the impact of exchange rates and cost of living on economic size estimations.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy’s trade balance, consider the following statements:**

1.  A trade deficit occurs when a country's imports of goods and services exceed its exports, leading to a net outflow of funds.
2. Increased government spending (G) in an open economy leads to a larger increase in output compared to a closed economy, while simultaneously improving the trade balance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is a correct definition of a trade deficit – a fundamental concept in international economics.  A trade deficit implies that a country is consuming more than it produces domestically, requiring it to import goods and services. This leads to a net outflow of funds to pay for these imports.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that in an open economy, an increase in government spending leads to a *smaller* increase in output compared to a closed economy and results in a *deterioration* (worsening) of the trade balance. This is due to a portion of the increased demand falling on imports, rather than solely on domestic goods.  The fact that a portion of increased demand goes to imports reduces the multiplier effect on domestic output and simultaneously increases the trade deficit.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**6. With reference to Fiscal Policy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Revenue expenditure includes all government expenditures that result in the creation of physical or financial assets, such as infrastructure projects.
2.  A government budget deficit occurs when total government receipts (taxes and other revenues) exceed total government expenditures.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text defines revenue expenditure as expenditures that *do not* result in the creation of physical or financial assets.  These are expenses incurred for the normal functioning of government departments and services, interest payments, and grants. Capital expenditure, on the other hand, involves investment in assets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A government budget deficit occurs when total government *expenditures* exceed total government *receipts*.  A surplus occurs when receipts exceed expenditures.  This is a fundamental aspect of government budgeting and fiscal policy.

Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**7. With reference to the Paradox of Thrift, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Paradox of Thrift suggests that if all individuals in an economy simultaneously increase their saving rate, the aggregate savings of the economy will necessarily increase.
2.  A decrease in the marginal propensity to consume (mpc) leads to a downward swing of the aggregate demand (AD) line, potentially resulting in a lower equilibrium output.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Paradox of Thrift demonstrates the counterintuitive outcome that when individuals attempt to save more, the overall level of saving in the economy may not increase or might even decrease.  This happens because reduced consumption leads to lower aggregate demand, which, in turn, reduces income and overall saving.  The reduction in income offsets the increase in the saving rate.

Statement 2 is correct.  A decrease in the mpc (meaning an increase in the marginal propensity to save) does indeed reduce the slope of the AD line, causing it to swing downwards. This is because a smaller portion of any increase in income is now spent on consumption. The resulting lower aggregate demand can lead to a lower equilibrium level of output.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**8. With reference to the measurement of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), consider the following statements:**

1. The product or value-added method of calculating GDP involves summing up the final value of all goods and services produced in an economy, including intermediate goods.
2. The income method of calculating GDP involves summing up the total factor payments (wages, rent, interest, and profit) made to all factors of production.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The product or value-added method of calculating GDP specifically *excludes* intermediate goods to avoid double counting.  It focuses on the value added at each stage of production.  Only the final value of goods and services is included in the GDP calculation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The income method accurately describes calculating GDP by summing up all factor payments made in the economy.  This method reflects the income generated from production activities.  Wages, rent, interest, and profit represent the payments made to labor, land, capital, and entrepreneurship, respectively.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.



**9. Consider the following statements regarding the characteristics of public goods:**

1. Public goods are characterized by rivalry in consumption, meaning one person's consumption diminishes the amount available for others.
2.  Public goods are non-excludable, meaning it is impossible or very difficult to prevent individuals from consuming the good even if they do not pay for it.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A key characteristic distinguishing public goods from private goods is the *absence* of rivalry in consumption.  One person's consumption of a public good does not diminish the amount available for others.  This is in contrast to private goods where consumption is rivalrous.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly defines public goods as non-excludable.  This non-excludability is a major reason why the market mechanism fails to provide them efficiently, necessitating government intervention.  The free-rider problem arises directly from this non-excludability.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**10. With reference to the components of the Government Budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Tax revenues in India consist solely of direct taxes levied on individuals and firms, excluding indirect taxes such as excise and customs duties.
2. Revenue receipts of the central government include both tax revenues and non-tax revenues, with non-tax revenues comprising interest receipts, dividends, and other miscellaneous receipts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Tax revenues in India include both direct taxes (on individuals and firms) and indirect taxes (such as excise duties, customs duties, and service tax).  The text specifically mentions the composition of tax revenue, highlighting both direct and indirect taxes.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly describes revenue receipts as encompassing both tax and non-tax revenues. Non-tax revenues are further detailed, including interest receipts, dividends, and profits on government investments, along with fees for services.  This accurate depiction of revenue sources is fundamental to understanding government finances.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.



**1. With reference to Public Goods, consider the following statements:**

1. Public goods are characterized by non-rivalry, meaning one person's consumption does not diminish another's, and non-excludability, where preventing non-payers from accessing the good is difficult or impossible.
2. Examples of public goods include national defense, lighthouse services, and clean air, but not privately-owned toll roads or club goods like private parks.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the core characteristics of public goods.  Non-rivalry implies that multiple individuals can simultaneously benefit from the good without reducing its availability to others.  Non-excludability means it's practically infeasible to restrict access to the good based on payment.  This often leads to the "free-rider problem," where individuals benefit without contributing.

Statement 2 provides valid examples. National defense and lighthouse services are classic illustrations of public goods due to their non-rivalrous and non-excludable nature.  Clean air, in its purest form, also fits this description.  However, the exclusion is possible in case of privately owned toll roads and club goods which are excludable.  Therefore, statement 2 is partially correct, highlighting the key distinction between public goods and other types of goods.  The inclusion of these examples, while not entirely inaccurate, serves as a subtle distractor, testing the examinee's nuanced understanding of the concept.


**2. With reference to Subsidies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian government's major explicit subsidies in 2022-23 totalled approximately 5.25 lakh crore rupees, primarily allocated to food, fertilizer, and fuel.
2. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) aims to reduce leakages and improve the targeting of subsidies by transferring funds directly to beneficiaries’ accounts, but it may not fully address the regressive nature of some subsidies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects the substantial allocation of explicit subsidies by the Indian central government in 2022-23, with the majority going towards food, fertilizer, and fuel.  The figures provided are approximate, but the overall magnitude and allocation are accurate representations of government spending.

Statement 2 accurately describes the goals and potential limitations of DBT. While DBT aims to enhance efficiency and reduce leakages associated with traditional subsidy delivery methods by transferring money directly to beneficiaries' linked bank accounts, it doesn't inherently solve the problem of regressive subsidies.  Some subsidies, even when delivered through DBT, may still disproportionately benefit wealthier households due to consumption patterns. For example, electricity subsidies might benefit wealthier households more due to higher consumption.  The statement's acknowledgment of this limitation demonstrates a thorough understanding of the policy's complexities.


**3. With reference to the Indian Economy's growth and poverty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Green Revolution, starting in the mid-1960s, significantly contributed to faster agricultural growth, leading to a decline in poverty, primarily because it increased the availability of food grains.
2. High savings rates in India, while a positive indicator, do not always translate into proportional increases in output due to factors such as a high capital-output ratio or inefficient allocation of capital.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly links the Green Revolution to poverty reduction. The increased agricultural production, particularly of food grains, directly addressed food insecurity, a major contributor to poverty in rural India.  While other factors influenced poverty reduction, the Green Revolution played a significant, direct role.

Statement 2 accurately highlights the complexities of economic growth.  High savings rates are crucial for investment and growth, but several factors can hinder their effectiveness in boosting output.  A high capital-output ratio means that a large amount of investment is needed to generate a unit of output, potentially limiting the impact of savings.  Inefficient allocation of capital, due to factors like bureaucratic hurdles or policy failures, further diminishes the potential for growth. This statement reflects a sophisticated understanding of macroeconomics and development challenges.


**4. With reference to the Indian Economy's pre-1991 policies, consider the following statements:**

1. The "License Raj," characterized by extensive government regulations and controls on industrial activity, hampered competition, entrepreneurship, and efficient resource allocation.
2. The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act of 1969, while intended to curb monopolies, inadvertently stifled business expansion and innovation, particularly affecting large industrial houses.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the negative consequences of the "License Raj."  The excessive regulations and bureaucratic hurdles created inefficiencies, discouraged competition, and hindered the growth of entrepreneurship.  Businesses spent more time navigating red tape than focusing on innovation and productivity.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the unintended consequences of the MRTP Act.  While aiming to prevent the concentration of economic power, the Act's restrictive provisions limited the expansion and diversification of large industrial houses, hindering their potential for growth and innovation.  The act's impact on large business houses like the Tatas is a commonly cited example.  Both statements pinpoint key policy failures that contributed to the economic challenges faced by India before 1991.


**5. With reference to  methods for disbursing subsidies, consider the following statements:**

1. Price subsidies, while offering protection against inflation and price volatility, often lead to regressive outcomes, distorting markets and hurting the poor more than intended.
2. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and Income Support, unlike price subsidies, avoid market distortions, leakages, and regressive effects, making them superior anti-poverty tools.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately captures the inherent challenges of price subsidies.  While they can offer short-term relief from inflation, they often benefit wealthier households more due to higher consumption levels (regressive).  Furthermore, they can distort market mechanisms by interfering with price signals, leading to inefficiencies in resource allocation.  The example of fertilizer subsidies diverting resources away from other crops is a case in point.

Statement 2 is an oversimplification. While DBT and Income Support can mitigate leakages and improve targeting, they are not entirely free from drawbacks.  DBT can still be regressive if the subsidy amount is not carefully calibrated according to need.  Income Support, while avoiding market distortions, may face challenges with implementation and potential issues concerning work incentives.  The claim that they are entirely superior is an overstatement, making it an incorrect statement.


**6. With reference to the components of the government budget, consider the following statements:**

1. Revenue receipts consist of tax revenues (direct and indirect taxes) and non-tax revenues (interest receipts, dividends, and fees).
2. Revenue expenditure includes expenses incurred for the normal functioning of government departments and interest payments on government debt, but excludes capital expenditure on the creation of assets.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly outlines the composition of revenue receipts in a government budget. Tax revenues include direct taxes (like income tax and corporate tax) and indirect taxes (like excise duty, customs duty, and service tax). Non-tax revenues are generated from sources other than taxation, such as interest earned on government loans, dividends from investments, and fees for services.

Statement 2 accurately defines revenue expenditure. It encompasses recurring expenses necessary for the day-to-day operations of government departments, including salaries, administrative costs, and interest payments on loans.  Crucially, it distinguishes revenue expenditure from capital expenditure, which involves investments in physical or financial assets.  The distinction between these two types of expenditure is fundamental to budget analysis.


**7. With reference to  Human Capital Formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Investments in education and health are primary sources of human capital formation, enhancing individual productivity and contributing to overall economic growth.
2. On-the-job training provided by firms and migration of skilled workers are secondary factors in human capital formation, with limited impact on national productivity.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies education and health as primary drivers of human capital formation. Investments in these areas directly improve the skills, knowledge, and health of the workforce, leading to increased productivity and economic growth.  These are considered fundamental inputs for human development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  On-the-job training significantly enhances worker skills and productivity, making it a crucial element of human capital formation.  Similarly, migration of skilled workers, while involving costs, can contribute significantly to both the sending and receiving economies.  The statement underestimates the importance of these factors.  The correct answer highlights the critical role of education and health in human capital formation.


**8. With reference to  the Indian Economy's performance before 1991, consider the following statements:**

1.  Despite significant progress in industrial diversification and food self-sufficiency, the Indian economy faced limitations due to inefficient public sector enterprises and excessive government regulation.
2.  The inward-oriented trade policies and lack of export competitiveness hindered the development of a robust export sector and limited India's integration into the global economy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately summarizes some key aspects of the Indian economy before 1991. While the period saw advancements in industrialization and food production, there were significant inefficiencies within the public sector, often attributed to bureaucratic control and lack of competition.  Excessive government regulation stifled entrepreneurship and innovation.

Statement 2 correctly points to the limitations of inward-oriented trade policies.  The focus on import substitution and protectionism, while initially aimed at fostering domestic industries, ultimately hindered the development of export competitiveness and integration into the global economy.  This limited access to foreign markets and technology. Both statements reflect a balanced assessment of the period's achievements and limitations.


**9. With reference to the  Paradox of Thrift, consider the following statements:**

1. The Paradox of Thrift suggests that increased individual savings can paradoxically lead to a decrease in aggregate savings due to the multiplier effect on income.
2.  A decrease in the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) shifts the aggregate demand (AD) curve downwards, resulting in lower equilibrium income and unchanged aggregate savings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly explains the core concept of the Paradox of Thrift.  When individuals save more, their consumption decreases, reducing aggregate demand. This lower demand leads to reduced production and income, ultimately affecting overall savings.  The multiplier effect amplifies the initial impact of the change in saving behavior.

Statement 2 accurately describes the graphical representation and outcome. A decrease in MPC reduces the slope of the AD curve, leading to a lower equilibrium income level. Surprisingly, despite the individual increase in savings propensity, the overall level of aggregate savings remains unchanged because the reduction in income offsets the increased savings rate.  This counterintuitive result is the essence of the Paradox of Thrift.


**10. With reference to  the concept of  effective demand, consider the following statements:**

1. In a situation with perfectly elastic aggregate supply at a given price level, aggregate output is solely determined by the level of aggregate demand.
2.  The autonomous expenditure multiplier quantifies the extent to which a change in autonomous spending (like investment or government expenditure) impacts the overall equilibrium income, given constant prices and interest rates.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the effective demand principle.  Under conditions of perfectly elastic aggregate supply, the economy's output is limited only by the level of aggregate demand.  Producers will supply whatever is demanded at the prevailing price level. This is a simplification often used in macroeconomic models to analyze short-run fluctuations.

Statement 2 correctly defines the autonomous expenditure multiplier.  This multiplier shows how a change in autonomous spending (spending not dependent on income) affects equilibrium income.  The magnitude of the multiplier depends on the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).  The assumption of constant prices and interest rates simplifies the analysis.  Both statements are core concepts in Keynesian economics.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  In the Keynesian model, an increase in autonomous investment leads to a multiplied increase in aggregate output through a series of rounds of increased consumption spending.
2.  The size of the output multiplier in the Keynesian model is inversely related to the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Keynesian multiplier effect describes how an initial increase in autonomous spending (like investment) leads to a larger overall increase in aggregate demand and output.  This happens because increased income from the initial investment leads to increased consumption, which further boosts income and consumption in subsequent rounds. This process continues until the cumulative effect diminishes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The size of the output multiplier is *inversely* related to the marginal propensity to *save* (MPS), not the MPC.  A higher MPS means a smaller proportion of additional income is spent on consumption, leading to a smaller multiplier effect.  The formula for the multiplier is 1/(1-MPC) or 1/MPS, demonstrating the inverse relationship with MPS.  A higher MPC implies a larger multiplier.


**2. With reference to the “Paradox of Thrift,” consider the following statements:**

1.  Increased saving by individuals always leads to a larger overall level of saving in the economy.
2.  The Paradox of Thrift illustrates how individual attempts to increase saving can paradoxically lead to a decrease in aggregate saving.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Paradox of Thrift demonstrates that this is not always true.  If everyone simultaneously attempts to save a larger portion of their income, aggregate demand falls. This reduction in demand leads to lower production and income, ultimately resulting in a decrease or no change in overall saving.  Individual actions have aggregate consequences that are not always intuitive.

Statement 2 is correct. The paradox arises because the reduced consumption resulting from increased saving reduces aggregate demand and national income. This income reduction, in turn, offsets the initial increase in saving, leading to a lower or unchanged level of aggregate saving.  It highlights the interconnectedness of economic agents and the limitations of relying solely on individual saving to boost economic growth.


**3. With reference to the Keynesian model of income determination, consider the following statements:**

1.  In a closed economy with lump-sum taxes, the government expenditure multiplier is greater than the tax multiplier in absolute value.
2.  In a closed economy with proportional taxes, the multiplier effect is smaller compared to a scenario with lump-sum taxes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The government expenditure multiplier directly impacts aggregate demand, while the tax multiplier works indirectly through its effect on disposable income and consumption.  Because of this indirect effect, the government expenditure multiplier is always larger than the tax multiplier (in absolute value) in a closed economy with lump-sum taxes.

Statement 2 is also correct. With proportional taxes, the tax rate is a fraction of income.  This reduces the marginal propensity to consume out of income (MPC falls to c(1-t), where t is the tax rate).  A lower MPC leads to a smaller multiplier effect, as a smaller proportion of any increase in income is spent on consumption, dampening the multiplier effect compared to lump-sum taxes.


**4. With reference to the government budget, consider the following statements:**

1.  Revenue receipts include only tax revenues collected by the central government.
2.  Revenue expenditure includes all government spending that does not create physical or financial assets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Revenue receipts encompass both tax revenues (direct and indirect taxes) and non-tax revenues (like interest receipts, dividends, fees).  The government receives income from various sources, not just taxes.

Statement 2 is correct. Revenue expenditure comprises spending on day-to-day government operations, salaries, interest payments, and grants that do not result in the creation of assets.  It contrasts with capital expenditure, which is investment in physical or financial assets for future use.


**5. With reference to the concepts of open and closed economies, consider the following statements:**

1. In a closed economy, saving and investment are always equal.
2. In an open economy, a trade deficit implies that national saving exceeds investment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. In a closed economy, there are no international transactions.  Therefore, national income (Y) is allocated to consumption (C), saving (S), and investment (I).  The accounting identity Y = C + S = C + I implies that S = I; saving must equal investment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. In an open economy,  S = I + NX (Net Exports). A trade deficit (NX < 0) means that net exports are negative; the country is importing more than it is exporting. This implies that national saving (S) is *less than* investment (I).  The trade deficit is financed by net capital inflows.


**6. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Seigniorage refers to the profit a central bank earns from its commercial banking activities.
2.  The inflation tax is a component of seigniorage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Seigniorage is the profit a central bank makes from issuing currency. It's not related to commercial banking activities. The central bank's profits come from the difference between the face value of the currency issued and the cost of producing it, plus any interest earned on reserves.

Statement 2 is correct. The inflation tax is a crucial part of seigniorage.  When the central bank increases the money supply (e.g., by printing more money), it can lead to inflation.  This inflation erodes the real value of money held by the public, effectively acting as a tax on money holdings. This loss in purchasing power contributes to the central bank's seigniorage.


**7. With reference to the characteristics of public goods, consider the following statements:**

1.  Public goods are always provided by the government.
2.  A key characteristic of public goods is that they are non-excludable, meaning it is difficult to prevent individuals from consuming them even if they do not pay.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the government often provides public goods, it’s not a defining characteristic.  Private entities can also provide public goods, though often with the help of government subsidies or regulations to address the free-rider problem.

Statement 2 is correct. Non-excludability is a fundamental attribute of public goods.  The difficulty of excluding non-payers from consumption is what creates the free-rider problem, where individuals can benefit from the good without contributing to its provision.  This is why government intervention is often necessary.


**8. With reference to fiscal policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  A balanced budget multiplier is always equal to zero.
2.  A decrease in lump-sum taxes increases aggregate demand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A balanced budget multiplier is equal to 1, not 0. This means that an equal increase in government spending and taxes will lead to an equal increase in aggregate demand and output (assuming no crowding out).

Statement 2 is correct.  Lump-sum taxes are a fixed amount, not dependent on income.  A decrease in lump-sum taxes increases disposable income, leading to higher consumption and thus increased aggregate demand.  This stimulates economic activity.


**9. With reference to inclusive growth, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth prioritizes income redistribution over productive employment creation.
2.  The concept of inclusive growth emphasizes sustained, broad-based growth benefiting all segments of the population.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Inclusive growth focuses on creating productive employment opportunities that allow all segments of society to participate in and benefit from economic growth. While income redistribution might play a supporting role, it's not the central tenet.  The goal is to enable sustainable participation, not just redistribute existing wealth.

Statement 2 is correct. Inclusive growth aims for sustained economic expansion that's broadly distributed across different sectors and regions, lifting all sections of the population out of poverty or marginalization.  It's not just about the overall growth rate but also the distribution of benefits.


**10.  With reference to subsidies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Price subsidies are always efficient and effectively target the intended beneficiaries.
2.  Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) aims to reduce leakages and improve the targeting of subsidies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Price subsidies often suffer from inefficiencies. They can be regressive (benefiting the rich more than the poor), distort markets (leading to overproduction of subsidized goods and underproduction of others), and suffer from leakages (subsidies not reaching the intended beneficiaries).

Statement 2 is correct. DBT aims to address the shortcomings of price subsidies by directly transferring cash to eligible beneficiaries' accounts.  This reduces leakages, improves targeting, and allows beneficiaries to choose how to spend the money, leading to greater efficiency.  The JAM trinity (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile) is crucial to the effectiveness of DBT.



**1. With reference to the concept of the multiplier mechanism in the final goods market, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in autonomous investment leads to a proportionally larger increase in aggregate output due to the multiplier effect.
2.  The size of the multiplier is inversely related to the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The multiplier effect explains how an initial increase in autonomous spending (like investment) leads to a larger increase in overall aggregate output.  This happens because the initial increase in spending becomes income for others, who then spend a portion of it, creating further income and spending, and so on. This chain reaction amplifies the initial impact on output.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The size of the multiplier is *directly* related to the MPC. A higher MPC means a larger portion of any increase in income is spent, leading to a larger multiplier effect.  Conversely, a lower MPC (higher MPS) means a smaller portion is spent, resulting in a smaller multiplier. The formula for the simple multiplier is 1/(1-MPC) or 1/MPS; clearly showing a direct relationship between the multiplier and MPC.  A higher MPC leads to a larger denominator, resulting in a smaller multiplier. This is a common misconception that needs to be clarified.


**2. With reference to the Paradox of Thrift, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the marginal propensity to save (MPS) always leads to a higher level of aggregate saving in the economy.
2.  The Paradox of Thrift demonstrates that individual attempts to increase saving can paradoxically lead to a decrease in aggregate saving.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Paradox of Thrift highlights that while individual attempts to save more might seem beneficial, it can have unintended consequences on the aggregate level. If everyone suddenly decides to save a larger proportion of their income, aggregate demand decreases. This reduction in demand leads to a fall in output and income, ultimately reducing aggregate savings.  The increased saving is offset by the decline in overall economic activity.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Paradox of Thrift is a counter-intuitive macroeconomic phenomenon. Increased individual thriftiness, manifested by a higher MPS, reduces aggregate demand.  The reduced demand forces firms to cut back production, leading to lower national income. This lower income, in turn, reduces overall savings, even though individual saving rates have increased. The net effect can be a decrease in, or no change to, total savings. This paradox highlights the interconnectedness of individual actions and macroeconomic outcomes.


**3. With reference to the determination of equilibrium income and net exports in an open economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  In an open economy, an increase in government spending (G) leads to a larger increase in equilibrium income compared to a closed economy.
2.  An increase in autonomous expenditure in an open economy always results in an improvement in the trade balance (a trade surplus).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. In an open economy, an increase in government spending (G) leads to a *smaller* increase in equilibrium income compared to a closed economy. This is because a portion of the increased demand spills over into imports, reducing the multiplier effect on domestic output.  The open economy multiplier is smaller due to import leakage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An increase in autonomous expenditure in an open economy typically results in a *deterioration* of the trade balance (a trade deficit). The increased domestic demand leads to higher imports, while exports remain relatively unchanged in the short run. This increase in imports outweighs any potential increase in exports, resulting in a wider trade deficit.  The extent of this deterioration depends on the marginal propensity to import (MPM).


**4. With reference to the components of the government budget in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Revenue receipts include tax revenues (direct and indirect taxes) and non-tax revenues (interest receipts, dividends, etc.).
2.  Revenue expenditure includes all government spending that leads to the creation of physical or financial assets.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Revenue receipts represent the government's income from various sources. Tax revenues are a major component, comprising direct taxes (like income tax) and indirect taxes (like GST). Non-tax revenues encompass income from sources other than taxes, such as interest earned on government loans, dividends from investments, and fees for services.  These receipts fund the government's day-to-day operations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Revenue expenditure refers to government spending that *does not* result in the creation of physical or financial assets.  It includes expenses on salaries, subsidies, interest payments on debt, and grants. Capital expenditure, on the other hand, is spending that does create assets (like infrastructure projects).  The distinction between revenue and capital expenditure is crucial for understanding the government's fiscal position.


**5. With reference to the functions of money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money serves as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions and eliminating the need for barter.
2.  Money's function as a store of value is always reliable, regardless of inflation rates.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The primary function of money is to act as a medium of exchange. It simplifies transactions by eliminating the double coincidence of wants required for barter systems.  Money's acceptability as a means of payment greatly enhances economic efficiency and specialization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While money serves as a store of value, its effectiveness depends on the stability of its purchasing power. During periods of high inflation, the purchasing power of money erodes, making it a less reliable store of value.  Other assets may become more attractive stores of value during inflationary periods.  The reliability of money as a store of value is directly linked to price stability in the economy.


**6. With reference to the Indian economy's growth and development, consider the following statements:**

1.  High savings rates automatically translate into high rates of capital formation and economic growth.
2.  A high capital-output ratio indicates efficient utilization of capital in production.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While high savings rates are a necessary condition for investment and growth, they do not guarantee high rates of capital formation or economic growth.  The efficiency of investment, technological progress, and institutional factors also play crucial roles.  Simply having savings available does not automatically translate into productive investment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A high capital-output ratio signifies that a large amount of capital is needed to produce one unit of output. This indicates *inefficient* utilization of capital. A low capital-output ratio, conversely, suggests that capital is being used more efficiently in production.  The capital-output ratio is an indicator of capital productivity and overall economic efficiency.  A high ratio suggests that either capital is being misallocated or that technological progress is lagging.


**7. With reference to the measurement of India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), consider the following statements:**

1.  Before 2015, India's GDP was primarily calculated at factor cost, excluding indirect taxes and subsidies.
2.  Since 2015, India has adopted the methodology of calculating GDP at market prices, including indirect taxes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Before 2015, India's GDP calculation primarily used factor cost as the basis. This method excluded indirect taxes and subsidies, focusing on the value added at each stage of production.  This was a common practice in many developing economies.

Statement 2 is correct.  From 2015, India shifted to calculating GDP at market prices, aligning with global best practices and recommendations from international organizations like the IMF.  The market price method includes indirect taxes, providing a more comprehensive measure of the total value of goods and services produced in the economy.  This change in methodology led to revisions in historical GDP data as well.


**8. With reference to the concept of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1.  PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of a similar basket of goods and services across different countries.
2.  PPP exchange rates always accurately reflect the relative purchasing power of different currencies in the real world.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries’ currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It aims to determine the exchange rate that would equalize the purchasing power of a currency in different countries.  By comparing the prices of a common basket of goods, PPP attempts to adjust for differences in price levels across countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  PPP exchange rates are a theoretical construct and do not always perfectly reflect real-world exchange rates.  Several factors, including trade barriers, transportation costs, non-tradable goods, and market imperfections, can cause deviations from PPP.  While PPP provides a useful benchmark for comparing purchasing power, it is not a precise predictor of actual exchange rates.  It serves as a useful theoretical framework for analysis but has limitations in practice.


**9. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPI gives a greater weightage to food items compared to the WPI.
2.  The WPI captures changes in the prices of services, while the CPI does not.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CPI (Consumer Price Index) focuses on the prices of goods and services consumed by households.  Food items typically constitute a significant portion of household expenditure, leading to a higher weightage for food in the CPI compared to the WPI.  The CPI is a key indicator of inflation from the consumer's perspective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WPI (Wholesale Price Index) primarily tracks the prices of goods at the wholesale level and does *not* generally include services. In contrast, the CPI includes both goods and services consumed by households.  The choice between using the CPI or WPI as a measure of inflation depends on the specific economic context and the target audience.  The CPI is generally considered a better measure of inflation impacting consumers.


**10.  With reference to the factors affecting market demand for a good, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the price of a substitute good will increase the market demand for the good in question.
2.  An increase in the price of a complementary good will increase the market demand for the good in question.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of each other. If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper good, increasing its demand. This is a fundamental principle of demand theory.  The cross-price elasticity of demand between substitute goods is positive.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Complementary goods are those that are consumed together. If the price of a complementary good increases, the demand for the good in question will *decrease*.  This is because the higher price of the complementary good makes the combination of goods more expensive, reducing the overall demand. The cross-price elasticity of demand between complementary goods is negative.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Command and Control" approach to economic planning, prevalent in India from 1950 to 1990, prioritized centralized decision-making based on pre-determined production targets for major industries like steel, cement, and coal, irrespective of market forces.
2.  The "Plug and Play" model, as envisioned by the Prime Minister, emphasizes government provision of supportive infrastructure, policies, and land, enabling private businesses to establish operations without excessive bureaucratic hurdles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the "Command and Control" approach to economic planning in India during the pre-1991 era.  This system, characterized by central planning and state-owned enterprises, prioritized production targets over market mechanisms.  The government dictated production quotas, plant capacity, and technology choices for key industries.  This approach, while aiming for self-sufficiency and industrial growth, often led to inefficiencies and a lack of responsiveness to consumer demand.

Statement 2 correctly explains the essence of the "Plug and Play" model. This policy framework aims to streamline business establishment procedures by providing a supportive ecosystem.  The government undertakes the responsibility of creating the necessary infrastructure, enacting favorable policies, and ensuring land availability, thereby reducing bureaucratic barriers for private sector investment and participation.  The intended outcome is to foster ease of doing business and stimulate economic growth.  Both statements are accurate reflections of distinct approaches to economic management in India, representing a shift from centralized control to a more market-oriented approach.


**2. With reference to the "Amrit Kaal" vision for India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Panch Pran" (five pledges) of Amrit Kaal include a commitment to achieving a developed India by 2047, eradicating all vestiges of colonial-era mindset, and fostering national unity and solidarity.
2.  Amrit Kaal, encompassing the 25 years leading up to India's centenary in 2047, prioritizes a holistic development approach that encompasses infrastructural development, technological advancement, and social inclusion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies key elements of the "Panch Pran" outlined within the Amrit Kaal vision.  The five pledges explicitly aim for a developed India by 2047, emphasizing the elimination of colonial mentalities, promoting pride in India's heritage, fostering unity and solidarity, and highlighting the duties and responsibilities of citizens. These pledges represent a multi-faceted approach to national development.

Statement 2 accurately captures the broader context of Amrit Kaal.  While not explicitly listing all aspects, the statement correctly points towards a comprehensive development strategy. The 25-year period aims to achieve substantial progress across various sectors, including infrastructure, technology, and social inclusion, to realize the vision of a developed India by 2047.  The holistic nature of the vision encompasses economic progress alongside social and cultural development.  Both statements are accurate and reflective of the Amrit Kaal vision.


**3. With reference to Inclusive Growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Inclusive growth prioritizes equitable distribution of economic benefits, ensuring that all segments of society, irrespective of socio-economic background, participate in and benefit from economic progress.
2.  Strategies for achieving inclusive growth in India include focusing on productive employment generation in sectors where the poor are employed, reducing prices of essential consumption items, and addressing structural inequalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the core principle of inclusive growth.  It goes beyond simply increasing GDP, emphasizing the equitable distribution of economic benefits across all segments of the population. This includes considerations of economic class, gender, caste, religion, and other factors that contribute to social and economic disparities. The goal is not just growth, but growth that is shared and benefits all members of society.

Statement 2 correctly highlights key strategies for achieving inclusive growth in the Indian context.  Focusing on job creation in sectors employing the poor, such as agriculture, is crucial.  Simultaneously, reducing the prices of essential goods ensures that the poor can afford basic necessities and benefit from economic growth. Addressing existing structural inequalities, including rural-urban disparities, gender imbalances, and caste-based discrimination, is also necessary for inclusive growth.  Both statements accurately reflect the concepts and strategies surrounding inclusive growth.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding India's economic development:**

1.  Despite high savings rates, significant increases in output might not always result from capital formation due to factors such as a high capital-output ratio, indicating inefficiency in capital utilization.
2.  An increase in both absolute and per capita real GNP does not necessarily indicate higher economic development if poverty and unemployment remain high, signifying a lack of inclusive growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 highlights a crucial aspect of economic development: the efficiency of capital utilization. Even with high savings rates leading to substantial capital formation, the outcome might not be proportional to the investment if the capital-output ratio is high. A high capital-output ratio suggests that a large amount of capital is required to produce a unit of output, indicating inefficiencies in resource allocation, technological limitations, or other structural issues hindering productivity.  Therefore, merely increasing capital investment without addressing these underlying issues might not translate into a significant increase in output.

Statement 2 emphasizes that economic development is not solely measured by aggregate economic indicators like GNP.  While growth in real GNP (per capita and absolute) indicates expansion in the economy's output, it doesn't reflect the distribution of benefits.  If poverty and unemployment persist despite overall economic growth, it indicates a lack of inclusive growth and raises concerns about the welfare of a significant portion of the population.  True development requires not just economic expansion but also improvements in the well-being of all citizens.  Both statements correctly point out limitations of solely relying on aggregate economic indicators to assess economic development.


**5. With reference to macroeconomic indicators in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) assigns a higher weight to food items compared to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), reflecting the significance of food prices in household budgets.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) primarily uses the WPI as its key measure of inflation to determine monetary policy decisions, although the CPI is also considered.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the difference in the composition of CPI and WPI. The CPI is a measure of the average change in prices paid by urban and rural consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.  Food items constitute a substantial portion of household expenditure, particularly for low-income households, hence they receive a larger weight in the CPI calculation. The WPI, on the other hand, measures the average change in prices of goods at the wholesale level, encompassing a broader range of goods, but with a relatively lower weight on food items compared to CPI.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI considers both CPI and WPI, the CPI has become the primary measure of inflation for monetary policy decisions.  The RBI's shift towards CPI as the key inflation indicator reflects the greater relevance of consumer prices in assessing the impact of inflation on household welfare. The WPI, while still used as a supplementary indicator, does not hold the same prominence as the CPI in shaping the RBI's monetary policy decisions.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing access to credit and facilitating their participation in the organized economy.
2.  The "Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme" and "Gold Monetization Scheme" primarily aim to reduce India's dependence on gold imports by mobilizing idle gold holdings within the country and channeling them into productive investments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the objective of the PMMY.  This scheme aims to promote entrepreneurship among small businesses and micro-units by providing them with access to credit, which is often a major hurdle for such ventures.  By facilitating access to formal financial institutions, PMMY reduces reliance on informal and often exploitative sources of credit, thereby supporting the growth and formalization of the small business sector.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the core purposes of the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme.  These schemes aim to reduce India's reliance on gold imports, a significant drain on foreign exchange reserves.  By encouraging households to convert their idle gold holdings into bonds or deposit them in monetization schemes, the government aims to mobilize this gold, potentially reducing the need for imports and channeling the gold into productive financial assets.  Both statements accurately reflect the objectives of these government initiatives.


**7. With reference to the functions of money in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money serves as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions and eliminating the need for barter systems which require a double coincidence of wants.
2.  Money acts as a store of value, allowing individuals to save purchasing power for future use, although its value can be affected by inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the primary function of money as a medium of exchange.  Money simplifies transactions by eliminating the need for barter, which requires a double coincidence of wants (both parties needing what the other possesses).  Money serves as a universally accepted medium for exchanging goods and services, facilitating economic activity.

Statement 2 correctly highlights money's role as a store of value.  Money allows individuals to defer consumption, saving purchasing power for future needs.  However, it's important to note the caveat that the value of money as a store of value is subject to fluctuations due to inflation.  Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money over time, reducing its effectiveness as a long-term store of value.  Both statements accurately reflect crucial functions of money in an economy.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the Indian banking system:**

1.  Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India primarily focus on providing credit to small business units and small and marginal farmers, promoting financial inclusion and supporting underserved sectors.
2.  The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) refers to the charge levied on merchants by banks for accepting payments from customers using debit cards, representing a transaction fee for processing digital payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the primary mandate of Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India.  SFBs are specifically designed to cater to the financial needs of small businesses, small and marginal farmers, and other underserved segments of the population.  They play a critical role in promoting financial inclusion by providing access to credit and other financial services in areas where traditional banks may have limited presence or reach.

Statement 2 correctly defines the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR).  The MDR is a fee that merchants pay to banks for processing debit card payments.  This fee covers the costs associated with the transaction, including network charges, processing fees, and risk management.  The MDR is a crucial element of the digital payments ecosystem, facilitating the acceptance of debit and credit card payments by merchants.  Both statements accurately reflect important aspects of the Indian banking system.


**9. With reference to financial instruments and markets in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by large corporations to raise short-term funds from the money market, typically for working capital needs.
2.  Call money refers to short-term interbank lending, where banks lend and borrow funds among themselves for short periods, typically overnight, to manage their liquidity requirements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Commercial Paper (CP). CP is a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by large and creditworthy corporations to raise short-term funds directly from the money market.  It is a cost-effective way for corporations to meet their short-term financing needs, typically related to working capital requirements.  The issuance of CP is regulated to ensure the safety and soundness of the money market.

Statement 2 correctly defines call money in the context of the Indian financial system.  Call money is a short-term, unsecured borrowing and lending mechanism primarily used by banks to manage their daily liquidity needs.  Banks lend and borrow funds among themselves for very short periods, often overnight, to ensure they have sufficient funds to meet their obligations.  Call money rates are a significant indicator of short-term interest rates in the Indian money market.  Both statements accurately describe these financial instruments and their roles in the Indian financial system.


**10. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and its functions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the Central Government and holds significant power in the conduct of monetary policy and the overall management of the banking system.
2.  The RBI manages and services both Government of India Securities and State Government Securities, playing a crucial role in the debt management of both central and state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the appointment and powers of the RBI Governor. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India is appointed by the Central Government of India.  The Governor heads the central bank and plays a pivotal role in formulating and implementing monetary policy, overseeing banking regulations, and managing the overall financial stability of the nation.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the RBI manages and services Government of India Securities, its role in managing State Government Securities is limited. The RBI does not directly manage or service all State Government Securities.  Some State Government Securities might be managed through other channels or agencies.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**11. With reference to foreign investment in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) primarily involves non-debt-creating capital flows, representing equity investments in companies, unlike Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) which often involves debt instruments.
2.  Foreign currency convertible bonds and Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) are considered forms of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly distinguishes between FDI and FII. FDI represents long-term equity investments in companies, aiming for managerial control or significant influence.  These investments are primarily non-debt-creating, meaning they do not involve borrowing or debt servicing obligations.  In contrast, FII typically involves portfolio investments in stocks and bonds, often short-term and focused on financial returns rather than managerial control.  FIIs often involve debt instruments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While GDRs can sometimes be considered FDI if they lead to a transfer of ownership or control, they are not always classified as such.  Foreign currency convertible bonds are primarily considered debt instruments and do not automatically qualify as FDI.  The classification depends on the specific terms and conditions of the investment.  Only statement 1 provides a consistently accurate distinction between the nature of FDI and FII.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding macroeconomic policies and inflation:**

1.  Demand-pull inflation can be exacerbated by expansionary fiscal policies, which increase aggregate demand beyond the economy's productive capacity, leading to upward pressure on prices.
2.   A devaluation of a currency necessarily improves the trade balance and increases the foreign value of the domestic currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies a cause of demand-pull inflation. Expansionary fiscal policies, characterized by increased government spending or tax cuts, boost aggregate demand.  If this increased demand exceeds the economy's capacity to produce goods and services, it leads to upward pressure on prices, resulting in demand-pull inflation.  This occurs because consumers are competing for a limited supply of goods.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While devaluation can make exports more competitive (thus potentially improving the trade balance), it does not *necessarily* do so.  The outcome depends on several factors, including the price elasticity of demand for exports and imports, the responsiveness of domestic producers to increased demand, and the presence of other external factors influencing trade flows.  Furthermore, devaluation reduces the foreign value of the domestic currency, not increases it.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**13. With reference to the measurement of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), consider the following statements:**

1. The product method of calculating GDP involves summing the value added at each stage of production across all sectors of the economy, excluding double-counting of intermediate goods.
2. The income method of calculating GDP involves adding up all the factor incomes (wages, rent, interest, and profit) earned within the domestic territory of a country during a given period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the product or value-added method of GDP calculation. This method avoids double-counting by summing only the value added at each stage of production. The value added is the difference between the value of output and the value of intermediate goods used in production.  By focusing on value added, this method accurately captures the contribution of each sector to the overall GDP without overestimating the total output.

Statement 2 correctly explains the income method of GDP calculation. This method focuses on the income generated from production activities within a country's borders. It sums up all factor incomes—wages, rent, interest, and profit—earned by individuals and firms involved in production.  The total of these factor incomes represents the aggregate income generated within the economy during a specified period, which is equivalent to the GDP.  Both methods provide alternative, yet equivalent, approaches to calculating GDP.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's economic shift post-independence:**

1.  India's transition from an agrarian economy to a service-based economy bypassed significant industrial development.
2.  The lack of readily available land for industrial purposes, coupled with complex land acquisition processes, hindered the growth of the manufacturing sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's economic development followed an unusual path, transitioning directly from an agricultural to a service-based economy, largely bypassing substantial industrialization as seen in other developing nations. This atypical trajectory is a significant aspect of India's post-independence economic history, often debated in the context of its developmental challenges and opportunities.  This is attributed to various factors, including policy choices, infrastructural limitations, and the global economic landscape.

Statement 2 is also correct. The scarcity of land suitable for industrial development, combined with cumbersome and time-consuming land acquisition procedures, presented a major obstacle to the growth of the manufacturing sector. This difficulty in securing land for industrial projects created a significant bottleneck, preventing the establishment of large-scale manufacturing units and hindering the overall expansion of the industrial base.  This issue continues to be a significant challenge for industrial development in India.  The complex bureaucratic processes and legal frameworks surrounding land acquisition often lead to delays and increased costs, making India less attractive for large-scale industrial investments compared to other nations with more streamlined processes.


**2. With reference to the factors hindering India's manufacturing sector growth, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's costly and inefficient transportation infrastructure, including railways and roads, has increased production costs and reduced competitiveness.
2.  The complexities of India's labor laws, with numerous central and state regulations, have discouraged investment in manufacturing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  India's transportation infrastructure, while improving, has historically been a significant constraint on manufacturing growth.  High freight costs associated with rail transport and inadequate road connectivity, particularly in rural areas, increase the overall cost of production. This makes Indian-manufactured goods less competitive in both domestic and international markets compared to those from countries with more efficient and cost-effective transportation systems.  The lack of efficient logistics also leads to delays and supply chain inefficiencies, impacting productivity and profitability.


Statement 2 is also correct. The complex and often contradictory nature of India's labor laws has created a challenging environment for businesses, particularly in the manufacturing sector.  The numerous central and state-level regulations, coupled with rigid hiring and firing procedures, increase compliance costs and reduce the flexibility needed for efficient operations. This regulatory burden deters both domestic and foreign investment in manufacturing, contributing to slower growth in the sector.  Recent attempts at labor code consolidation aim to address this issue, but the impact of these reforms remains to be fully assessed.


**3. With reference to the Planning Commission and its functions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Planning Commission's primary objective was to rapidly improve the living standards of Indians by efficiently utilizing the country's resources.
2.  The Planning Commission was responsible for assessing the nation's resources, identifying deficiencies, and prioritizing their utilization for balanced development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Planning Commission, established in 1950, had as its core mandate the rapid improvement of the living standards of the Indian population. This was to be achieved through the efficient exploitation of the nation's resources, focusing on increased production and generating employment opportunities.  This objective reflected the post-independence government's commitment to social and economic upliftment.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A crucial function of the Planning Commission was the comprehensive assessment of India's resources – material, capital, and human.  This involved identifying areas where resources were scarce or deficient relative to national needs. Based on this assessment, the Commission formulated plans for the most effective and balanced utilization of resources, prioritizing investments and development strategies accordingly. This systematic approach to resource allocation and planning was a defining feature of India's early development strategy.


**4. With reference to the distribution of workforce in India (1999-2000), consider the following statements:**

1. The primary sector (agriculture and mining) employed more than three-fourths of the rural workforce.
2.  The service sector employed approximately 60% of the urban workforce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the occupational structure of rural India in 1999-2000. The primary sector, encompassing agriculture and related activities like mining and quarrying, remained the dominant source of employment in rural areas, employing a substantial majority of the workforce. This highlights the continued dependence of rural populations on agriculture despite efforts towards economic diversification.

Statement 2 is also correct. The service sector constituted a significant portion of the urban workforce in 1999-2000, employing around 60%. This signifies the growing importance of the service sector in urban areas, reflecting trends of urbanization and economic transformation.  This contrasts with the dominance of the primary sector in rural employment and underlines the sectoral disparities within India's workforce.


**5. With reference to the challenges faced by India's food processing industry, consider the following statements:**

1. Inadequate cold storage and warehousing facilities contribute significantly to post-harvest losses of agricultural produce.
2.  The lack of skilled manpower, particularly in specialized areas of food technology, hinders the industry's competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Inadequate infrastructure, especially the lack of sufficient cold storage and warehousing facilities, leads to substantial post-harvest losses in India's agricultural sector. Perishable goods like fruits and vegetables suffer significant spoilage due to insufficient storage and transportation facilities, reducing the quantity and quality of produce available for processing. This impacts both the profitability of the food processing industry and the income of farmers.

Statement 2 is also correct. The food processing industry faces a significant challenge in the form of a shortage of skilled manpower.  While institutions offer training in food technology, there is often a mismatch between the skills possessed by the available workforce and the specialized needs of the industry. This lack of adequately skilled personnel hampers the adoption of modern technologies, limits innovation, and affects the overall competitiveness of Indian food processing units in the global market.


**6. With reference to the "Make in India" initiative, consider the following statements:**

**8. With reference to India's power sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The majority of India's power distribution companies (DISCOMs) are state-owned public sector undertakings (PSUs).
2.  A major challenge faced by DISCOMs is the inability to increase electricity tariffs due to government control, leading to financial constraints.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The power distribution sector in India is largely dominated by state-owned DISCOMs. These are public sector undertakings under the control of respective state governments. This ownership structure has implications for efficiency, financial management, and responsiveness to market demands.

Statement 2 is also correct. DISCOMs often face significant financial difficulties due to the inability to adjust electricity tariffs to reflect actual costs.  Government regulations and political considerations frequently prevent them from raising tariffs, leading to accumulated losses. This financial strain hinders their ability to upgrade infrastructure, invest in modern technologies, and improve the overall efficiency of power distribution.  This financial instability is a major factor contributing to the challenges faced by India's power sector.


**9. With reference to the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates the allocation of coal mines through transparent electronic auctions, except for government companies.
2. The Act allows companies to sell coal won through auctions in the open market, removing the earlier restriction on captive mining in most cases.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key feature of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, is the introduction of transparent electronic auctions for the allocation of coal mines. This was a major departure from previous opaque allocation methods.  The auction process aims to ensure fairness and efficiency in the allocation of this crucial resource.  However, an exception is made for government companies which can receive allotment without going through an auction.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Act significantly altered the rules concerning captive mining.  Previously, coal blocks were allocated for captive use only, meaning companies could only use the coal for their specific projects and not sell it in the open market. The 2015 Act largely removed this restriction, allowing companies to sell the coal they have obtained through the auction process in the open market. This increased flexibility is intended to promote competition and efficiency in the coal sector.


**10. With reference to inclusive growth, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth prioritizes productive employment over direct income redistribution as a long-term strategy for poverty reduction.
2.  Inclusive growth encompasses four key attributes: opportunity, capability, access, and security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Inclusive growth emphasizes sustainable and broad-based economic development that benefits all segments of society, particularly the poor and vulnerable.  While short-term income redistribution measures might alleviate poverty temporarily, inclusive growth focuses on creating productive employment opportunities. This approach aims to empower individuals to earn their own livelihoods sustainably, leading to long-term poverty reduction. Direct income transfers are seen as a temporary, not a long-term, solution.

Statement 2 is also correct. The concept of inclusive growth is often framed around four crucial attributes.  "Opportunity" refers to the creation of economic opportunities for all. "Capability" focuses on empowering individuals to take advantage of these opportunities through skill development and education. "Access" ensures that everyone has equitable access to resources and markets.  "Security" provides social safety nets to protect against risks of livelihood loss.  These four attributes are interconnected and essential components of a truly inclusive growth strategy.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the characteristics of inclusive growth as defined by the World Bank, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth prioritizes income redistribution schemes as the primary means of poverty reduction.
2.  It emphasizes sustained, broad-based growth across sectors, encompassing a significant portion of the country's workforce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Bank's definition of inclusive growth centers on sustained economic expansion that benefits a wide range of the population.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this by highlighting the importance of broad-based growth across various sectors and the inclusion of a large portion of the workforce.  This ensures that the benefits of economic growth are not concentrated in a few hands but are distributed more equitably.  Statement 1, however, is incorrect. While income redistribution might play a supplementary role in mitigating the immediate impact of growth policies on the poor, inclusive growth fundamentally focuses on creating productive employment opportunities and fostering a sustainable growth trajectory. Direct income redistribution is seen as a short-term measure, not a long-term solution for poverty alleviation.  The emphasis is on enabling people to participate in and benefit from economic growth in a self-sustaining manner rather than relying solely on government transfers.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY):**

1.  PMFBY offers a uniform premium rate for all crops within a given season, irrespective of the crop or district.
2. The scheme covers post-harvest losses due to all types of calamities, including localized events like hailstorms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. PMFBY aims for a single premium rate per season for food grains, oilseeds, and pulses, simplifying the process and reducing regional variations.  However, it's crucial to note that while the scheme strives for uniformity, there might be slight variations for horticulture and cotton crops.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While PMFBY does cover post-harvest losses due to cyclones and unseasonal rains, it does *not* cover all types of calamities.  The coverage is specifically defined and excludes losses due to war, nuclear risks, malicious damage, and other preventable risks.  The scheme's comprehensive coverage is a significant feature, but it's not unlimited in scope. The inclusion of post-harvest losses is a notable step forward, but the limitations show that it's not a blanket protection against all potential losses.


**3. With reference to the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), consider the following statements:**

1. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission to enhance the involvement of states in national development planning.
2.  NITI Aayog's primary function is the allocation of funds to ministries and states, similar to the Planning Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  NITI Aayog was established to replace the Planning Commission, marking a shift towards cooperative federalism.  The inclusion of Chief Ministers and UT administrators in its Governing Council signifies a greater role for states in shaping national development priorities and strategies.  This bottom-up approach contrasts with the Planning Commission's top-down approach.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While both NITI Aayog and the Planning Commission acted as advisory bodies, a key difference is that NITI Aayog does *not* directly allocate funds.  The function of fund allocation now rests with the Ministry of Finance.  NITI Aayog's focus is on policy formulation, strategic planning, and monitoring, not direct financial disbursement.


**4.  With reference to the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF), consider the following statements:**

1. AHIDF exclusively supports the establishment of animal feed plants in the public sector.
2. Beneficiaries under AHIDF are required to contribute a minimum of 10% of the project cost as margin money.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AHIDF encourages investments in the private sector for the establishment of dairy and meat processing and value addition infrastructure, *as well as* animal feed plants.  The fund's purpose is to incentivize private investment in this sector, not restrict it to public entities.  Statement 2 is correct. AHIDF requires eligible beneficiaries (FPOs, MSMEs, etc.) to contribute a minimum of 10% of the project cost as margin money.  This ensures a level of commitment from the beneficiaries and reduces the reliance on government funding. The remaining 90% is provided as a loan component by scheduled banks.  This co-financing model is common in development initiatives to promote sustainability and responsible resource management.


**5. With reference to the concept of "inclusive growth," consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth is solely focused on accelerating the pace of economic growth, regardless of its distributional effects.
2.  The "capability attribute" of inclusive growth emphasizes providing people with the means to utilize available opportunities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Inclusive growth is not just about the speed of economic growth but also about its *pattern*.  It emphasizes equitable distribution of benefits, ensuring that all segments of society, including the most vulnerable, participate in and benefit from the growth process.  Focusing solely on the pace ignores critical aspects of equity and social justice. Statement 2 is correct. The "capability attribute" is a key component of inclusive growth.  It focuses on empowering individuals by providing them with the necessary skills, education, and resources to fully utilize the opportunities presented by economic growth.  This goes beyond simply creating opportunities; it's about ensuring people have the capacity to seize them.  This holistic approach recognizes that mere availability of opportunities is insufficient without the means to take advantage of them.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Narasimhan Committee reports on banking sector reforms:**

1. The Narasimhan Committee I recommended a gradual deregulation of interest rates and increased reliance on open market operations by the RBI.
2. The Narasimhan Committee II recommended reducing the government's equity in nationalized banks to 50% for increased autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Narasimhan Committee I (Committee on Financial System) indeed recommended a phased deregulation of interest rates and a shift towards open market operations as the primary tool for monetary policy by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This aimed to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the monetary system. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Narasimhan Committee II (Committee on Banking Sector Reforms) recommended reducing the government's equity in nationalized banks to 33%, not 50%, to promote greater autonomy and efficiency. The lower percentage was deemed sufficient to achieve the desired level of independence while still maintaining some government ownership.  The recommendation aimed at aligning the management and functioning of public sector banks with best international practices, allowing them to operate with greater efficiency and competitiveness.


**7. With reference to the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI involves acquiring less than 10% of the equity capital of a listed Indian company.
2. FPI investments in India are primarily channeled through the primary market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in India is defined as an investment of 10% or more of the equity capital of a listed company, or any investment in an unlisted company.  Acquiring less than 10% is classified as FPI (Foreign Portfolio Investment).  FPI investments predominantly occur in the secondary market, where existing shares are traded among investors. While FPI can also happen through primary market, it's less common. FDI, on the other hand, typically involves the issuance of new shares by the Indian company, bringing fresh capital into the firm. The distinction is based on the level of control and long-term commitment involved. FDI signifies active management participation, while FPI is primarily focused on capital appreciation through market fluctuations.


**8. With reference to the "Command and Control" and "Plug and Play" approaches to economic policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Command and Control" approach, prevalent in India before 1991, relied heavily on market forces to determine production levels.
2. The "Plug and Play" approach emphasizes minimizing bureaucratic hurdles and facilitating private sector investment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Command and Control" approach, characteristic of India's pre-1991 economic policy, involved centralized planning and government control over production levels, capacity, and technology choices. It did not rely on market forces but rather on top-down directives.  Statement 2 is correct. The "Plug and Play" approach, associated with more recent economic policies, aims to create a business-friendly environment with streamlined regulations and minimal bureaucratic interference.  This encourages private sector participation by providing the necessary infrastructure and policy support, reducing red tape and fostering ease of doing business.  The approach aims to simplify the process of setting up and operating businesses, attracting both domestic and foreign investment.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the P.J. Nayak Committee's recommendations on Public Sector Bank (PSB) governance:**

1. The committee recommended the establishment of a Bank Investment Company (BIC) to hold government ownership in PSBs, reducing government direct control.
2. The committee proposed the immediate repeal of the State Bank of India Act 1955 and the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act 1970.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The P.J. Nayak Committee recommended creating a Bank Investment Company (BIC) to manage the government's stake in PSBs. This would distance the government from day-to-day management decisions, enhancing the autonomy of the banks. The BIC would act as a holding company, allowing the government to retain ownership while promoting operational independence.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The committee did not recommend the immediate repeal of the mentioned Acts.  It recognized that the transition would require time and proposed an interim measure of establishing the Banks Board Bureau (BBB) to improve governance until the BIC could be fully implemented.  The phased approach reflected a practical understanding of the complexities involved in reforming the governance structure of PSBs.


**10. With reference to the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA), consider the following statements:**

1. IFSCA was established to regulate the business in IFSCs, previously handled by multiple domestic regulators.
2. IFSCA's headquarters are located in Mumbai, India's major financial hub.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. IFSCA (International Financial Services Centres Authority) was established to create a unified regulatory framework for financial products, services, and institutions in India's International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs). Before IFSCA, different domestic regulators like RBI, SEBI, and IRDAI handled various aspects of IFSC operations. The creation of IFSCA aimed to enhance coordination and efficiency by providing a single, holistic regulatory body.  Statement 2 is incorrect. IFSCA's headquarters are located in GIFT City, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, not Mumbai.  The choice of GIFT City reflects a strategic decision to develop a dedicated, modern financial center outside of established financial hubs.  The location was intended to create a more streamlined and efficient environment for international financial activities.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding constraints on industrial development in India:**

1.  The complexity of land acquisition processes significantly hinders the establishment of large-scale manufacturing units.
2.  High freight costs associated with India's railway system reduce the competitiveness of Indian manufactured goods in global markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's high population density and complicated land acquisition procedures make it difficult to secure large tracts of land needed for industrial projects. This contrasts sharply with countries that have streamlined land acquisition, allowing for faster development and increased competitiveness. The lengthy and cumbersome process increases project timelines and costs, deterring investment.

Statement 2 is also correct.  India's railway freight rates are among the highest globally, increasing the cost of transporting raw materials and finished goods.  This makes Indian products less competitive compared to those from countries with more efficient and cost-effective transportation infrastructure.  The lack of adequate railway track capacity further exacerbates this issue, leading to delays and congestion.  This directly impacts the profitability and global competitiveness of Indian manufacturing enterprises.


**2. With reference to the challenges faced by the "Make in India" initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  Low labor productivity in India's manufacturing sector, significantly lower than in competing nations like China and Thailand, poses a major obstacle to achieving the initiative's goals.
2.  The prevalence of shell companies and indirect foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows raises concerns about the transparency and effectiveness of foreign investment in the manufacturing sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a significant challenge.  Studies consistently show that Indian manufacturing workers are substantially less productive than their counterparts in other countries. This low productivity stems from factors such as insufficient skills, inadequate technology, and inefficient processes.  Addressing this requires significant investment in skill development and technological upgradation.  Without improved productivity, India's manufacturing sector will struggle to compete effectively on the global stage.

Statement 2 highlights another crucial aspect.  A substantial portion of FDI inflows into India are channeled through shell companies, often based in tax havens. This raises concerns about the true source of the investment, potential money laundering, and the actual economic impact on the manufacturing sector.  The lack of transparency in these transactions hinders the effectiveness of the "Make in India" initiative and undermines efforts to attract genuine foreign investment.


**3. With reference to the evolution of India's economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's economic transition has been unique in its direct shift from an agricultural economy to a service-based economy, bypassing significant industrial development in the intermediate stage.
2. The Planning Commission, established in 1950, played a pivotal role in shaping India's economic policies and implementing Five-Year Plans aimed at accelerating economic growth and improving living standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a key characteristic of India's economic development.  Unlike many other nations that followed a sequential path from agriculture to industry and then to services, India experienced a relatively rapid shift from agriculture to services, with the industrial sector lagging behind. This unusual trajectory has implications for employment, income distribution, and overall economic structure.  The reasons for this include policy choices, infrastructural limitations, and other factors.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Planning Commission, though now defunct, was a crucial institution in India's post-independence economic planning.  It played a central role in formulating and implementing Five-Year Plans, which aimed to achieve various developmental goals, including resource allocation, industrial growth, and poverty reduction.  These plans, while debated in their effectiveness, were instrumental in shaping the direction of India's economic policies for several decades.


**4.  With reference to the factors affecting manufacturing growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The inadequate availability of 24/7 cheap power supply has hampered the growth of manufacturing industries in many regions, leading to industrial closures.
2.  The complexity of labor laws in India, including difficulties in hiring and firing workers, deters entrepreneurs from investing in the manufacturing sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately points to a critical constraint.  Reliable and affordable power is essential for manufacturing.  Power shortages and high electricity costs significantly increase production expenses, making Indian goods less competitive. The closure of industries in regions facing chronic power issues demonstrates the severe impact of this constraint on manufacturing growth.

Statement 2 correctly identifies another major hurdle. India's labor laws, while designed to protect workers, have also been criticized for being overly rigid and cumbersome. The difficulty in hiring and firing employees, coupled with other regulatory complexities, discourages investment in labor-intensive manufacturing activities.  This contrasts with countries that have more flexible labor markets, attracting greater investment and fostering industrial growth.



**5. Consider the following statements about India's economic reforms post-1991:**

1. The economic reforms initiated in 1991 led to a significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign exchange reserves.
2. While the reforms resulted in increased GDP growth, they have been criticized for not adequately addressing challenges in employment generation, particularly in the agricultural sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 1991 reforms ushered in an era of liberalization, privatization, and globalization, leading to a substantial increase in FDI and a significant rise in India's foreign exchange reserves.  This influx of capital fueled economic growth and helped integrate India into the global economy.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the reforms stimulated GDP growth, they have faced criticism for failing to generate sufficient employment opportunities, especially in the agricultural sector.  The reforms, while promoting certain sectors, also led to job losses in others and increased income inequality.  The lack of adequate attention to employment generation remains a significant concern in the context of India's economic development.


**6. With reference to the comparison between Indian and Chinese agriculture (2018-19), consider the following statements:**

1.  China's agricultural output significantly surpasses India's, despite having a smaller area of agricultural land.
2.  China's approach to agricultural subsidies, focusing on direct payments to farmers, contrasts with India's system of heavily subsidizing inputs like fertilizers and electricity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The data clearly shows that China's agricultural output is substantially larger than India's, even though China has less agricultural land. This reflects higher productivity in Chinese agriculture, driven by various factors, including technological advancements, efficient resource management, and policy interventions.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The two countries differ significantly in their approaches to agricultural subsidies. China has moved towards a more direct payment system to farmers, providing them with greater flexibility in their production choices.  India, in contrast, continues to heavily subsidize inputs, which can lead to inefficiencies and environmental concerns.  This difference highlights contrasting policy approaches to agricultural support.


**7. With reference to the "Make in India" initiative's targets, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative aims to increase the manufacturing sector's growth rate to 12-14% per annum and raise its share in GDP from 15% to 25% by 2025.
2. A key objective of "Make in India" is to create 100 million additional jobs in the manufacturing sector by 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the ambitious targets set for the "Make in India" initiative.  The goal is to significantly boost the manufacturing sector's contribution to India's overall economy. This requires substantial investment, policy reforms, and improvements in infrastructure and productivity.  While the 2025 target may be challenging, it represents a strategic goal for economic transformation.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Job creation is a central pillar of the "Make in India" initiative.  The target of creating 100 million additional jobs by 2022 was a significant aim, although the achievement of this target is subject to debate and analysis.  The initiative aims to generate employment opportunities through both domestic and foreign investment in manufacturing.


**8. With reference to the functions of money in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money serves as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions and reducing the need for barter systems.
2.  Money acts as a store of value, enabling individuals and businesses to preserve wealth over time.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies a primary function of money.  The most fundamental role of money is to serve as a medium of exchange.  Without money, transactions would rely on cumbersome barter systems, limiting economic activity and efficiency.  Money simplifies transactions, making them faster and more convenient.

Statement 2 is also correct. Money, in its various forms, acts as a store of value, although its effectiveness in this role depends on factors such as inflation.  Individuals and businesses can save money for future purchases or investments, making it a crucial element in economic planning and decision-making.  Other assets can also act as a store of value, but money’s widespread acceptance and liquidity provide unique advantages.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of economic reforms on different sectors in India:**

1.  Economic reforms have led to a slowdown in the growth of the industrial sector, partly due to increased competition from cheaper imports.
2.  The disinvestment of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) has been criticized for potentially undervaluing assets and for using the proceeds to offset government revenue shortfalls rather than for reinvestment in PSUs or social infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a consequence of economic liberalization.  Increased competition from cheaper imports, resulting from trade reforms, has impacted certain segments of the Indian industrial sector.  Domestic industries, lacking competitiveness in some areas, have faced challenges in adjusting to the new globalized environment.  This has led to job losses and a slowdown in growth in specific sectors.

Statement 2 correctly points to a critique of the disinvestment policy.  The sale of PSU assets has faced criticism for potentially undervaluing these assets and for not using the proceeds strategically to strengthen PSUs or invest in critical social infrastructure.  The use of disinvestment proceeds to cover revenue shortfalls has raised concerns about the long-term implications for public sector enterprises and overall economic development.


**10. With reference to India's employment scenario, consider the following statements:**

1.  A significant portion of India's workforce is employed in the informal sector, lacking access to social security benefits and employment protections.
2.  The growth of the service sector has led to the emergence of new job opportunities, many of which are in the informal sector and characterized by casual employment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a defining feature of India's employment landscape. The informal sector accounts for a substantial proportion of employment, leaving many workers vulnerable and lacking crucial social security benefits and protections offered in the formal sector. This informalization of the workforce is a significant socio-economic challenge.

Statement 2 is also correct. The growth of the service sector has, indeed, generated numerous job opportunities. However, many of these jobs are in the informal sector, characterized by casual employment, low wages, and limited job security. This highlights the dual nature of service sector growth—creating jobs but often without the benefits and protections associated with formal employment.


**1. With reference to the "Command and Control" approach in Indian economic planning (1950-1990), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Central Government meticulously planned the production volume, plant capacity, and technology for major industries like steel, cement, and coal.
2.  Market forces of demand and supply significantly influenced decision-making during this period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the "Command and Control" system prevalent in India from 1950 to 1990.  The central government held a dominant role in economic planning, dictating production targets, plant capacities, and technological choices for key industries. This top-down approach minimized the role of market mechanisms and prioritized centralized control.  This approach was a characteristic feature of the socialist-inspired five-year plans, aiming for rapid industrialization and self-reliance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The essence of the "Command and Control" system was the deliberate suppression of market forces.  Demand and supply were not the primary drivers of production decisions; rather, these were determined by government directives based on broader national development goals, often neglecting market signals of consumer preferences or efficient resource allocation. The system aimed at a planned economy, contrasting sharply with market-driven economies. The shift towards a more market-oriented approach only began to gain traction after the 1991 liberalization reforms.


**2. With reference to the "Plug and Play" model of economic development, consider the following statements:**

1.  The government provides comprehensive policy support, land, and infrastructure, enabling private businesses to easily establish operations.
2.  The model emphasizes extensive bureaucratic control and regulatory hurdles to ensure efficient resource allocation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the "Plug and Play" model as envisioned by the Prime Minister.  This approach aims to create a business-friendly environment where the government streamlines processes, provides essential infrastructure, and minimizes bureaucratic red tape. The goal is to simplify the process of setting up and operating businesses in India, attracting both domestic and foreign investments.  The emphasis is on facilitating private sector participation and removing obstacles to economic activity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Plug and Play" model directly contradicts the concept of extensive bureaucratic control. Its core principle is to reduce regulatory burdens and simplify procedures for businesses, thus promoting ease of doing business and attracting investments.  The model actively seeks to minimize bureaucratic hurdles and promote a more efficient and transparent regulatory environment.  The presence of significant bureaucratic control would be antithetical to the model's objectives.


**3. With reference to the "Amrit Kaal" vision for India, consider the following statements:**

1.  One of the "Panch Pran" (five pledges) is the commitment to achieving a developed India by 2047.
2.  The "Panch Pran" explicitly focuses on increasing agricultural subsidies as a primary means of achieving economic prosperity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key aspect of the "Amrit Kaal" vision.  The commitment to achieving a developed India by 2047 (India@100) is a central pillar of the "Panch Pran," the five pledges outlined by the Prime Minister. This reflects a long-term strategic goal aimed at transforming India into a developed nation across various sectors, including economic, social, and technological spheres.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the "Amrit Kaal" vision certainly encompasses economic development and improvement in agricultural productivity, it does not specifically prioritize increased agricultural subsidies as a primary means. The "Panch Pran" focuses on broader national goals, including national development, eradication of slavery, pride in heritage, unity, and citizen duties.  The approach towards agricultural development may involve various strategies, but increased subsidies are not explicitly mentioned as a central tenet of the vision.


**4. With reference to inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Inclusive growth aims to ensure equitable distribution of economic benefits across all segments of society, regardless of economic class, gender, or religion.
2.  Inclusive growth primarily focuses on direct income redistribution schemes as the primary means of poverty reduction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the core concept of inclusive growth. It emphasizes the equitable distribution of economic benefits, ensuring that all sections of society, including marginalized groups, participate in and benefit from economic progress. This involves addressing inequalities related to economic class, gender, caste, religion, and geographical location.  The aim is to foster a more just and equitable society where the benefits of economic growth are widely shared.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While income redistribution schemes can play a supplementary role in mitigating immediate poverty, inclusive growth does not primarily rely on such schemes for long-term poverty reduction.  The focus is on creating productive employment opportunities, improving access to resources and education, and empowering marginalized communities to participate in the economy. Direct income redistribution is seen as a short-term measure, while sustainable long-term solutions are prioritized.  Inclusive growth emphasizes sustainable and productive employment rather than solely focusing on income transfers.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy's growth after 2014, consider the following statements:**

1.  The growth of the service sector has been a significant driver of India's overall economic growth.
2.  The agricultural sector has consistently maintained high growth rates, contributing significantly to poverty reduction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key trend in India's post-2014 economic growth.  The service sector, encompassing IT, finance, and other services, has been a major contributor to the overall GDP growth. This sector has demonstrated robust growth, creating employment opportunities and driving economic expansion.  The growth of this sector has been pivotal in boosting India's economic performance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The agricultural sector's growth rate has been relatively modest and inconsistent compared to the service sector. While agriculture remains a crucial sector employing a large section of the population, its contribution to overall GDP growth has been less significant than the service sector.  Furthermore, the agricultural sector's performance has not consistently ensured significant poverty reduction, as various factors like climate change, market fluctuations, and lack of access to technology continue to challenge the sector's contribution to poverty alleviation.


**6. With reference to foreign-owned e-commerce firms operating in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  These firms are permitted to sell their own goods alongside offering their platforms as marketplaces.
2.  There are significant restrictions on the extent to which these firms can own large sellers on their platforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Regulations governing foreign-owned e-commerce firms in India generally restrict their ability to directly sell their own goods on their platforms.  The primary focus is on maintaining a level playing field for domestic businesses and preventing unfair competition.  The regulations generally encourage these platforms to function primarily as marketplaces connecting buyers and sellers, rather than competing directly with them as retailers.

Statement 2 is correct.  Indian regulations aim to prevent dominance by foreign e-commerce giants.  The regulations limit the extent to which these firms can own or control large sellers on their platforms, thereby promoting competition and preventing monopolies. This is aimed at protecting smaller businesses and ensuring a more balanced market.  The restrictions are designed to prevent a scenario where the platform itself becomes the primary seller, potentially squeezing out smaller competitors.


**7.  With reference to the functions of the Public Sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A primary function is to provide public utility resources such as electricity, water, and transportation.
2.  The Public Sector exclusively focuses on profit maximization, mirroring the operations of private sector enterprises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies a key role of the public sector in India. Providing essential public utility resources is a crucial function, often undertaken due to the significant social benefits and the potential for market failures in the provision of these services. This includes areas like infrastructure development, electricity generation and distribution, water management, and public transportation.  These are often considered essential for overall societal well-being and may not always be efficiently provided by the private sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While some public sector undertakings (PSUs) may aim for profitability, the primary goal of the public sector extends beyond pure profit maximization.  PSUs often play a crucial role in achieving social and economic objectives, such as promoting regional development, providing employment, and ensuring access to essential goods and services, even in less profitable ventures.  Profitability is important, but it's not the sole or even primary focus for many public sector enterprises.


**8. With reference to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Companies Act 2014 mandates CSR spending for eligible companies.
2.  Companies are required to spend at least 10% of their annual net profit on CSR activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Companies Act 2014 introduced mandatory CSR provisions for companies meeting specific criteria regarding size and profitability.  This legislation requires these companies to spend a certain percentage of their profits on CSR activities, promoting social responsibility and sustainable development.  The legislation aims to channel corporate resources towards addressing social issues and contributing to national development goals.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Companies Act 2014 mandates a minimum CSR spending of 2% (not 10%) of the company's average net profits of the preceding three years.  The specific percentage may vary slightly depending on the company's size and profitability, but it is significantly lower than 10%.  The legislation aims to strike a balance between promoting social responsibility and not unduly burdening businesses.


**9. With reference to Bitcoins, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bitcoin transactions are centrally tracked by government authorities.
2.  Bitcoin transactions can be conducted anonymously, without revealing the identities of the parties involved.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bitcoin transactions are not centrally tracked by any government or authority.  The Bitcoin network operates on a decentralized blockchain technology, meaning that transactions are recorded across a distributed network of computers rather than a central database.  This makes it difficult for any single entity to monitor or control all transactions.  While some information about transactions may be publicly available on the blockchain, linking specific transactions to individuals' identities is often challenging.


Statement 2 is largely correct, although there are some nuances. Bitcoin transactions can offer a degree of anonymity, as they do not require users to disclose their real-world identities. The transactions are identified by unique cryptographic keys (Bitcoin addresses), not personal information. However, it's crucial to note that complete anonymity is not guaranteed.  Sophisticated tracing techniques can be used to link Bitcoin addresses to real-world identities in certain circumstances, particularly if the user interacts with regulated financial institutions or exchanges.  The level of anonymity is a complex issue dependent on user behaviour and the level of investigation.


**10. With reference to Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMMY primarily aims to provide financial assistance to farmers for agricultural purposes.
2.  PMMY aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMMY is not primarily focused on providing financial assistance to farmers. While farmers may benefit indirectly through the scheme's support for small businesses related to agriculture, the primary aim is to support micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in the non-agricultural sector.

Statement 2 is correct. PMMY's main objective is to promote entrepreneurship and financial inclusion by providing credit to micro and small businesses, particularly those in the informal sector.  The scheme aims to help these enterprises access formal financial services, reducing their dependence on informal lenders and promoting sustainable growth. By bringing MSEs into the formal financial system, PMMY aims to improve their access to credit, business development services, and other financial tools, thus fostering entrepreneurship and economic growth.


**11. With reference to the Government's Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  A primary objective is to reduce India's dependence on gold imports.
2.  A key aim is to promote foreign direct investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Both the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme aim to mobilize idle gold held by households and institutions, reducing the need for gold imports.  By providing alternative investment avenues for gold, the schemes aim to reduce the demand for physical gold, thereby lowering the country's reliance on importing gold. This can improve the current account balance and reduce pressure on foreign exchange reserves.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While these schemes may indirectly contribute to increased investment in the gold sector, their primary objectives are not focused on promoting FDI. The schemes are primarily aimed at domestic mobilization of gold, increasing domestic gold reserves and reducing import dependence.  Attracting foreign investment may be a secondary or indirect outcome, but it is not a primary or stated goal of these schemes.


**12. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  NPCI plays a crucial role in promoting financial inclusion in India.
2.  NPCI is solely responsible for regulating all aspects of the banking sector in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NPCI plays a significant role in promoting financial inclusion through its various payment systems, such as IMPS, UPI, and others.  These systems provide convenient and accessible ways for individuals, especially those in rural and underserved areas, to conduct financial transactions.  By enabling digital payments, NPCI helps to expand access to financial services, reducing reliance on cash and promoting financial inclusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  NPCI is not responsible for regulating all aspects of the banking sector in India. That function is primarily performed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  NPCI is an operational entity focused on providing payment infrastructure and services. It collaborates with banks and other financial institutions to facilitate the smooth functioning of digital payment systems.  It does not have regulatory authority over the banking sector itself.


**13. With reference to the purpose of Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A primary objective of SFBs is to provide credit to small and marginal farmers.
2.  SFBs are primarily focused on catering to the financial needs of large corporations and multinational companies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  SFBs are specifically designed to cater to the financial needs of small businesses, small and marginal farmers, and low-income individuals.  Providing credit to these underserved segments is a central objective of SFBs. They aim to bridge the credit gap faced by these groups, promoting financial inclusion and economic empowerment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  SFBs do not primarily focus on large corporations or multinational companies.  Their mandate is to serve the financial needs of the unserved and underserved sections of the population, including small businesses, farmers, and individuals with limited access to formal financial services.  Large corporations and MNCs typically have access to a wider range of financial institutions and services, making them less reliant on SFBs.


**14. With reference to the "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1.  MDR refers to the incentive given by the government to merchants for promoting digital payments.
2.  MDR is the charge levied on a merchant by a bank for accepting payments through debit cards.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the government may offer incentives to encourage digital payments, MDR is not directly related to such incentives. MDR is a fee charged by banks to merchants for processing card payments.

Statement 2 is correct.  MDR is the fee or charge levied by banks on merchants for accepting payments made through debit or credit cards.  This charge covers the cost of processing the transaction, including network fees and other associated expenses.  The MDR is typically a percentage of the transaction value.  While the government may indirectly influence MDR through policies promoting digital payments, the MDR itself is a fee charged by the payment processors (banks) to the merchants.


**15. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Legal tender money refers to metallic money in circulation within a country.
2.  Legal tender money is money that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of debts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Legal tender money is not limited to metallic money. While metallic coins may be part of a country's legal tender, the definition encompasses a broader range of currency forms, including banknotes issued by the central bank.  The key aspect is the legal enforceability of acceptance, not the specific material form of the money.

Statement 2 is correct. Legal tender money is defined by its legal enforceability.  A creditor is legally compelled to accept legal tender money in repayment of a debt. This is a crucial characteristic that distinguishes legal tender from other forms of payment.  The legal backing ensures the acceptability of the currency as a medium of exchange and promotes the stability of the monetary system.


**16. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s functions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI manages and services both Government of India Securities and State Government Securities.
2.  Treasury bills are exclusively issued by the Central Government, with no such instruments issued by State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI manages and services Government of India Securities, its involvement with State Government Securities is limited.  The RBI's primary role is in managing the Central Government's debt, including treasury bills and other securities.  State Governments typically manage their own debt through other channels, though the RBI may play a supporting role in certain instances.

Statement 2 is correct. Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued primarily by the Central Government to meet its short-term borrowing needs.  State Governments do not typically issue treasury bills in the same way as the Central Government. While States may have their own borrowing mechanisms, these are generally different from treasury bills issued at the central level. The issuance of treasury bills is usually a prerogative of the central government, reflecting its role in managing national finances.


**17. With reference to Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), consider the following statements:**

1.  CAR is the amount of a bank's own funds maintained to offset potential losses from non-repayment of loans by borrowers.
2.  CAR is determined independently by each individual bank, without any external regulatory oversight.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. CAR is a crucial regulatory requirement for banks globally.  It represents the proportion of a bank's capital (equity and reserves) relative to its risk-weighted assets.  The purpose is to ensure that banks have sufficient capital to absorb potential losses arising from loan defaults or other financial risks. A higher CAR indicates greater financial strength and resilience of the bank.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CAR is not independently determined by each bank.  It is a regulatory requirement set by the central bank (in India, the RBI) and international regulatory bodies like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  Banks are required to maintain a minimum CAR as stipulated by the regulatory authorities.  The regulatory framework ensures that banks maintain adequate capital levels to mitigate financial risks and protect depositors' interests.  The regulations governing CAR ensure consistency and stability in the banking sector.


**18. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Advances (loans) are included in a commercial bank's assets.
2.  Deposits held by customers are considered assets of the commercial bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Advances, which represent loans given by the bank to borrowers, are considered assets of the bank.  These loans generate interest income for the bank, forming a crucial part of its profitability.  The loans are listed as assets on the bank's balance sheet, reflecting the bank's claim on the future repayment of these funds.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Deposits held by customers are liabilities, not assets, of the bank.  Deposits represent the bank's obligation to repay these funds to the depositors.  They are a source of funds for the bank, but they are not owned by the bank; rather, they are held in trust for the depositors.  The bank uses these deposited funds to provide loans and invest in other assets.  The bank has an obligation to return the deposits to the customer upon demand or as per the terms of the account.


**19. With reference to factors that mitigate the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Remittances from Indians working abroad contribute to foreign exchange reserves, reducing vulnerability to currency crises.
2.  Increasing government expenditure, particularly on non-productive assets, enhances a country's resilience to currency shocks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are a significant source of foreign exchange earnings for India.  These inflows strengthen the country's foreign exchange reserves, bolstering its ability to withstand external shocks and maintain currency stability.  Higher foreign exchange reserves provide a buffer against currency depreciation and reduce the vulnerability to currency crises.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Increasing government expenditure, especially on non-productive assets, can actually increase a country's vulnerability to currency crises.  Such spending can lead to higher inflation and fiscal deficits, potentially weakening the currency and making the country more susceptible to external shocks.  Sound fiscal management and efficient resource allocation are crucial for maintaining currency stability and reducing the risk of currency crises.  Excessive government spending without corresponding economic productivity can put pressure on the currency and increase the risk of a crisis.


**20. With reference to measures taken by the Government/RBI to prevent a decline in the value of the Indian Rupee, consider the following statements:**

1.  Easing conditions for external commercial borrowing (ECB) is a typical response to stabilize the Rupee.
2.  Following an expansionary monetary policy is a common strategy to counter Rupee depreciation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Easing conditions for ECBs can actually exacerbate Rupee depreciation in certain circumstances.  Increased inflow of foreign currency through ECBs can lead to higher demand for the Rupee, but if the inflow is not managed properly, it can also put pressure on the currency and lead to inflation and ultimately depreciation.  This is because it can increase money supply and increase import demand.  Therefore, it is not a standard practice to ease ECB conditions during a Rupee decline.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy, characterized by lower interest rates and increased money supply, typically weakens a currency, not strengthens it.  Such a policy can increase inflation and reduce the value of the currency.  To counter Rupee depreciation, a contractionary monetary policy is generally adopted, involving higher interest rates and reduced money supply, making the currency more attractive to foreign investors. This increases the demand for Rupee and thus stabilizes the currency.


**21. With reference to the money multiplier in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The money multiplier decreases with an increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR).
2.  The money multiplier increases with a decrease in the banking habit of the population.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The money multiplier is inversely related to the CRR.  CRR is the percentage of deposits that banks are required to hold as reserves with the central bank.  A higher CRR reduces the amount of money that banks can lend out, thus lowering the money multiplier.  The money multiplier is calculated as 1/CRR.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The money multiplier is directly related to the banking habit of the population.  A higher banking habit (more people depositing money in banks) increases the amount of money banks have available to lend, thereby increasing the money multiplier.  If fewer people use banks, the money multiplier will be lower as there will be less money available for banks to lend.


**22. With reference to actions that can provide immunity to India during a global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility is a crucial step to ensure resilience during a global financial crisis.
2.  Reducing dependence on short-term foreign borrowings is a strategy to mitigate the impact of global financial crises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While capital account convertibility offers certain benefits, maintaining full convertibility during a global financial crisis can increase vulnerability.  Full convertibility means the free flow of capital into and out of the country, which can lead to large capital outflows during a crisis, putting pressure on the currency and reserves.  Managed capital account convertibility offers better control and protection during times of global instability.

Statement 2 is correct.  Reducing reliance on short-term foreign borrowings is a crucial strategy to enhance resilience during a global financial crisis.  Short-term debt can be quickly withdrawn during a crisis, creating liquidity problems and exacerbating the impact of the crisis.  A longer-term debt strategy with a lower proportion of short-term borrowings provides greater financial stability and reduces the risk of sudden capital flight.


**23. With reference to the immediate effect of withdrawing cash from a demand deposit account, consider the following statements:**

1.  Withdrawing cash reduces the aggregate money supply by the exact amount withdrawn.
2.  Withdrawing cash increases the aggregate money supply because the withdrawn cash enters circulation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. When cash is withdrawn from a demand deposit account, the money supply is directly reduced by the amount withdrawn.  Demand deposits are part of the money supply (M1), and when cash is withdrawn, these deposits decrease, directly reducing the money supply.  The cash is no longer considered part of the demand deposits within the banking system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the withdrawn cash enters circulation, it does not increase the aggregate money supply.  The money supply is reduced by the amount withdrawn from the demand deposit account, as that money is no longer considered part of the money supply (M1) within the banking system.  The total money supply remains unchanged unless the withdrawn cash is subsequently deposited into another account or used to generate additional money through lending or other financial transactions.  The net effect is a reduction of money supply.


**24. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  KCC provides short-term credit for the construction of farmhouses and cold storage facilities.
2.  KCC provides short-term credit support for post-harvest expenses and consumption requirements of farm households.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. KCC primarily focuses on providing short-term credit for agricultural and allied activities.  While it may indirectly support some infrastructure development related to farming, it does not typically cover the construction of farmhouses or large-scale infrastructure like cold storage facilities.  These are usually covered by different schemes.

Statement 2 is correct. KCC provides short-term credit for various agricultural and allied activities, including post-harvest expenses and meeting the consumption needs of farm households. This ensures that farmers have access to credit for managing their day-to-day expenses and ensuring smooth functioning of their farming operations.  The scheme aims to provide financial support to farmers across various stages of farming.


**25. With reference to financial instruments in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations.
2.  Call money is a long-term finance instrument used primarily for interbank transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by large and creditworthy corporations to raise short-term funds.  It is an important instrument in the money market, providing a source of short-term finance for businesses.  The unsecured nature of CP means it relies on the creditworthiness of the issuer.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Call money is a short-term (not long-term) finance instrument used primarily for interbank transactions.  It is a very short-term loan between banks, typically used for managing short-term liquidity needs.  The maturity period is usually very short, ranging from a few days to a maximum of 14 days.  It is a crucial tool for maintaining liquidity in the banking system.


**26. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FDI primarily involves investment through capital instruments in listed companies.
2.  FDI is characterized as largely non-debt-creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FDI can involve investment in listed companies, it is not limited to this.  FDI encompasses a broader range of investments, including equity participation in both listed and unlisted companies, setting up new ventures, and mergers and acquisitions.  The investment can take various forms, not solely limited to listed companies.

Statement 2 is correct. FDI is primarily characterized as equity investment, representing ownership in the company.  Unlike foreign portfolio investment, which largely involves debt instruments, FDI is less likely to create debt obligations for the recipient country.  It represents a long-term commitment by the foreign investor, and the capital inflow is generally not accompanied by debt servicing obligations.  This makes FDI a relatively stable and less risky source of capital compared to debt-based investments.


**27. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Central Government.
2. The RBI Act grants the RBI Governor significant autonomy in its operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the President of India, but the appointment is made on the advice of the Central Government.  This reflects the government's ultimate authority, while the RBI operates with a degree of independence.

Statement 2 is also correct. The RBI Act grants the RBI significant autonomy in its operational matters.  This independence is crucial for maintaining the credibility and integrity of monetary policy.  The RBI is responsible for maintaining price stability and managing the currency, functions that require a degree of insulation from short-term political pressures.  However, it's important to note that this autonomy is not absolute, and the government retains ultimate authority.


**28. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  UCBs are directly supervised and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. UCBs are prohibited from issuing equity shares and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. UCBs, while having cooperative structures, are brought under the purview of the RBI's regulatory framework. The RBI plays a crucial role in supervising and regulating the operations of UCBs to ensure their financial stability and protect depositors' interests.  This oversight helps maintain confidence in the UCB sector and ensures adherence to banking norms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. UCBs are permitted to issue equity shares and preference shares, much like other types of banks.  This allows them to raise capital and expand their operations.  The ability to issue shares is a common feature of financial institutions, and UCBs are not excluded from this practice.


**29. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following statements:**

1.  Actions of the United States Federal Reserve (the Fed) have a significant impact on Indian Government Bond Yields.
2.  Inflation and short-term interest rates in India do not significantly

**1. With reference to the "Command and Control" and "Plug and Play" models of governance, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Command and Control" model, prevalent in India from 1950 to 1990, prioritized centralized planning and decision-making for major industries, irrespective of market forces.
2. The "Plug and Play" model, as envisioned by the Prime Minister, emphasizes government provision of infrastructure and policy support, allowing private businesses to operate with minimal bureaucratic interference.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the "Command and Control" model's characteristics in India's pre-1991 economy.  Centralized planning dictated production targets, capacity, and technology for key industries like steel, cement, and coal, largely disregarding market demand and supply dynamics. This approach was a hallmark of the socialist-inspired economic policies of the era.  The shift towards liberalization after 1991 signaled a departure from this model.

Statement 2 correctly reflects the essence of the "Plug and Play" model.  This concept, as articulated, focuses on creating a business-friendly environment where the government acts as a facilitator by providing essential infrastructure, streamlined policies, and reduced bureaucratic hurdles. The aim is to enable private sector growth by minimizing red tape and unnecessary government control, thus promoting ease of doing business.  The core idea is to provide the necessary "plugs" (infrastructure and support) so that private businesses can simply "play" (operate efficiently).


**2. With reference to the "Amrit Kaal" vision and its "Panch Pran" (five pledges), consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Panch Pran" prioritize achieving a developed India by 2047, eliminating vestiges of colonial slavery, celebrating India's heritage, fostering national unity, and emphasizing citizen duties.
2.  The "Amrit Kaal" represents a 25-year period, starting from India's 75th Independence Day, aiming to transform India into a developed nation by its centenary year (2047).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the "Amrit Kaal" vision and its core components. Statement 1 correctly identifies the five key pledges ("Panch Pran") outlined for the next 25 years.  These pledges encompass the national goal of achieving a developed India, eradicating any remnants of colonial mindset, showcasing India's rich heritage, maintaining national unity, and highlighting the responsibilities of citizens towards nation-building.

Statement 2 correctly defines "Amrit Kaal" as the 25-year period leading up to India's 100th year of independence in 2047. This period is envisioned as a transformative era focused on achieving the nation's development goals and fulfilling the "Panch Pran."  The framing of this period as "Amrit Kaal" (immortal period) signifies its importance in shaping India's future.


**3. With reference to Inclusive Growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth aims to ensure equitable distribution of economic benefits across all segments of the population, irrespective of socioeconomic status, gender, caste, religion, or region.
2.  The concept of inclusive growth prioritizes direct income redistribution schemes as the primary means of poverty reduction, even if it leads to unsustainable long-term fiscal burdens.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately captures the core principle of inclusive growth. It emphasizes that economic development should benefit all sections of society, addressing inequalities based on various factors like socioeconomic status, gender, caste, religion, and regional disparities.  The goal is to ensure that the benefits of growth are shared broadly and not concentrated in a few hands, leading to a more equitable and just society.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Inclusive growth does *not* primarily rely on direct income redistribution schemes as the main strategy for poverty reduction. While such schemes may play a supplementary role in the short term to mitigate the negative impacts on the poor during economic transitions, inclusive growth emphasizes long-term sustainable solutions. The focus is on creating productive employment opportunities, enhancing capabilities, and ensuring access to resources and markets for the marginalized sections of the population.  Direct income redistribution can be unsustainable and even counterproductive in the long run.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy post-2014, consider the following statements:**

1.  The growth and development of the Information Technology (IT) and IT-enabled services sector have significantly contributed to India's transformation from an agrarian economy to a service-based economy.
2. Despite high economic growth rates, a significant portion of the Indian population, particularly in rural areas and among marginalized communities, has been excluded from the benefits of this growth.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately highlights the transformative role of the IT and IT-enabled services sector in the Indian economy.  The growth of this sector has been a major driver of economic expansion, shifting India's economic structure from an agrarian base to a significant service-based economy. This sector has created millions of jobs and contributed substantially to India's GDP.

Statement 2 also reflects a critical aspect of India's economic development. While the overall growth rates have been impressive, the benefits have not been equally distributed.  A large segment of the population, especially in rural areas and among marginalized communities (women, children, backward castes and classes, and minorities), continues to face exclusion from the mainstream economy.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects a key aspect of globalization's impact.  Increased international trade and competition have created challenges for certain domestic industries in India, impacting their competitiveness and potentially leading to job losses in some sectors.  This highlights the need for policies to support domestic industries and enhance their competitiveness in the global market.

Statement 2 accurately points to a persistent asymmetry in international trade. While India has benefited from globalization through increased foreign investment and access to global markets, it still faces significant barriers in accessing the markets of developed countries due to various non-tariff barriers (regulations, standards, etc.). This limits India's ability to fully participate in global trade and realize its export potential.


**17. With reference to  India's disinvestment policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The government's disinvestment policy aims to raise revenue and improve the efficiency of public sector undertakings (PSUs).
2. Critics of disinvestment have raised concerns about the undervaluation of PSU assets during the sale process and the use of disinvestment proceeds for revenue generation rather than reinvestment in PSUs or social infrastructure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the stated objectives of India's disinvestment policy.  The government aims to raise revenue through the sale of its stake in PSUs, and also to improve the efficiency of these enterprises by transferring ownership to the private sector, which is often perceived as being more efficient.

Statement 2 correctly outlines a major criticism of the disinvestment process.  Critics argue that the government has often undervalued the assets of PSUs during disinvestment, leading to losses for the public exchequer.  Furthermore, they contend that the proceeds from disinvestment have been primarily used to bridge revenue shortfalls rather than being reinvested in the development of PSUs or the creation of social infrastructure, thereby hindering long-term growth and development.


**18. With reference to India's fiscal policies and economic reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. Tax reductions implemented during the reform period have not always resulted in increased tax revenue for the government, potentially due to factors such as tax evasion.
2. Economic reforms have led to limitations on the growth of public expenditure, particularly in social sectors, potentially affecting social development outcomes.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a challenge in implementing tax reforms in India.  While tax reductions were intended to stimulate economic activity and increase revenue through a wider tax base, they have not always yielded the expected results. Tax evasion and other factors have limited the effectiveness of these reforms, impacting government revenue.

Statement 2 correctly points to a trade-off associated with economic reforms.  While reforms have aimed to improve macroeconomic stability and efficiency, they have also led to constraints on public expenditure, particularly in social sectors like education and healthcare.  This has raised concerns about the potential negative impact on social development outcomes.  Balancing fiscal prudence with social development needs remains a challenge.


**19. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Investments in education and health are considered major sources of human capital formation, as they enhance productivity and contribute to economic growth.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately identifies key components of human capital formation.  Investments in education and health are crucial for improving the skills, knowledge, and health of the workforce, leading to higher productivity and greater economic growth.  These are considered fundamental inputs for human development.

Statement 2 correctly highlights additional sources of human capital formation.  On-the-job training provided by firms enhances the skills and productivity of employees, adding to the overall human capital stock.  Similarly, migration, when driven by the search for better employment opportunities, can lead to skill development and increased earnings, contributing to human capital formation although it may involve certain costs.


**20. With reference to the characteristics of physical and human capital, consider the following statements:**

1. Physical capital is mobile between countries, whereas human capital is less mobile due to factors such as cultural and social ties.
2.  Both physical and human capital depreciate over time, necessitating continuous investment in maintenance and upgrading.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately highlights a key difference between physical and human capital. Physical capital, such as machinery and equipment, can be relatively easily moved between countries.  However, human capital, which is embodied in individuals' skills and knowledge, is less mobile due to factors such as language barriers, cultural differences, and social networks.  The relocation of skilled labor involves significant costs and adjustments.

Statement 2 correctly points out that both physical and human capital are subject to depreciation.  Physical capital wears out or becomes obsolete over time, requiring maintenance, repairs, or replacement.  Similarly, human capital can depreciate due to skill obsolescence, lack of continued learning, or health issues.  Continuous investment in education, training, and healthcare is necessary to maintain and enhance human capital.




**1. With reference to the Industrial Policy Resolution 1956 (IPR 1956), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IPR 1956 classified industries into three categories based on ownership and control, with the state controlling the "commanding heights" of the economy.
2.  The policy aimed to promote regional equality by offering licenses and concessions to industries established in economically backward areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 was a landmark policy that significantly shaped India's industrial development.  Statement 1 is accurate because the IPR 1956 categorized industries into three schedules based on ownership (state, joint, private). The core principle was the state's control over strategically important sectors deemed crucial for the nation's economic progress, often referred to as "commanding heights." This aimed to steer industrial growth towards a socialist pattern of society, a key objective of the Second Five-Year Plan.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The licensing system under IPR 1956 was a tool to guide industrial location.  Industries locating in backward areas received incentives like tax breaks and subsidized electricity to bridge regional disparities and foster balanced growth. This was a conscious effort to address economic imbalances and promote inclusive development.  Options (a) and (b) are therefore incomplete, and option (d) is entirely incorrect as both statements reflect accurate aspects of the IPR 1956 policy.


**2. With reference to India's import substitution policy (pre-1991), consider the following statements:**

1.  The policy primarily focused on replacing imports with domestic production to reduce reliance on foreign goods and foster self-sufficiency.
2. The policy heavily relied on tariffs and quotas to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, even if it led to inefficiencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's pre-1991 economic policy was largely characterized by import substitution industrialization (ISI). Statement 1 accurately reflects the core aim of this strategy: to reduce reliance on imports and build a self-reliant industrial base.  The idea was to nurture domestic industries by shielding them from international competition, allowing them to grow and eventually become competitive on a global scale.  This aimed to achieve greater national economic self-reliance and reduce vulnerability to external shocks.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The import substitution policy employed protectionist measures such as high tariffs (taxes on imported goods) and quotas (limits on import quantities) to safeguard domestic industries. While this protected nascent industries, it also often led to inefficiencies due to the lack of competition. Domestic producers, facing little foreign competition, had less incentive to improve quality or efficiency.  Options (a) and (b) are thus incomplete, and option (d) is entirely false because both statements accurately capture key elements of India's import substitution strategy.


**3. With reference to the role of the public sector in India's industrial development (pre-1991), consider the following statements:**

1. The state played an extensive role due to a lack of private capital and a small domestic market, in addition to the socialist-inspired policy of controlling "commanding heights."
2.  The public sector's contribution to industrial diversification was significant, but its performance was often criticized for inefficiencies and losses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian government played a dominant role in industrial development before the 1991 reforms. Statement 1 accurately captures this, highlighting the twin reasons for this extensive state involvement. Firstly, the private sector lacked sufficient capital for large-scale industrial ventures. Secondly, the domestic market was small, reducing the incentive for private investment.  Furthermore, the socialist ideology of the time favored state control over key industries, the "commanding heights" of the economy, to direct industrial development according to national priorities.

Statement 2 is equally valid. The public sector did contribute significantly to industrial diversification. However, the performance of many public sector undertakings (PSUs) was often criticized for inefficiencies, bureaucratic hurdles, and substantial financial losses. This led to debates about the optimal role of the state in the economy and the need for greater efficiency and competition. Options (a) and (b) are thus incomplete, and option (d) is entirely incorrect because both statements reflect important aspects of the public sector's role in India's industrial development.


**4. With reference to the "permit license raj" in India (pre-1991), consider the following statements:**

1. The excessive regulations under the "permit license raj" hampered the efficiency of firms by diverting their focus from improving products to obtaining licenses.
2. The protection from foreign competition, even after it became detrimental, was a significant criticism of the "permit license raj" leading to a lack of incentive for quality improvement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "permit license raj," a system of extensive government controls and regulations, was a defining feature of India's pre-1991 economy. Statement 1 accurately points out that the complex licensing system and bureaucratic processes significantly hampered the efficiency of firms.  Instead of focusing on innovation, product improvement, and competition, businesses spent considerable time and resources navigating the regulatory maze, lobbying for licenses, and dealing with red tape.  This stifled entrepreneurial dynamism and hindered economic growth.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The "permit license raj" also involved protectionist policies that shielded domestic industries from foreign competition. While initially intended to foster domestic growth, this protection continued even when it became counterproductive.  The lack of competition led to complacency, reduced incentives for quality improvement, and hindered the development of a globally competitive industrial sector. Options (a) and (b) are therefore incomplete, and option (d) is false, reflecting the significant negative consequences of the "permit license raj."


**5. With reference to the impact of economic reforms in India (post-1991), consider the following statements:**

1.  While the GDP growth rate increased significantly, concerns remain about the reforms' impact on employment generation and equitable distribution of benefits.
2.  The agricultural sector faced challenges due to reduced public investment, removal of subsidies, and increased international competition following WTO membership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's economic reforms initiated in 1991 led to significant changes in the economy.  Statement 1 accurately reflects a key aspect of the post-reform period: while GDP growth accelerated substantially, concerns remain about the inclusiveness of this growth.  The reforms, while boosting overall economic output, did not always translate into sufficient employment generation, particularly in the formal sector.  Moreover, the distribution of benefits was uneven, leading to persistent income inequality.

Statement 2 is equally valid. The agricultural sector, a vital part of the Indian economy, faced significant challenges due to the reforms. Public investment in agriculture-related infrastructure (irrigation, research) was reduced.  The removal of fertilizer subsidies increased production costs, disproportionately affecting small and marginal farmers.  Finally, India's WTO membership exposed the agricultural sector to increased international competition, impacting domestic farmers.  Options (a) and (b) are therefore incomplete, and option (d) is false, showcasing the complex and multifaceted impacts of the post-1991 reforms.


**6. With reference to India's post-1991 economic reforms and globalization, consider the following statements:**

1.  Outsourcing, driven by advancements in information technology, emerged as a significant outcome, leading to growth in sectors like IT and BPO.
2.  India's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) led to both opportunities and challenges, including increased market access but also vulnerability to global economic fluctuations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's economic reforms and integration into the global economy had profound consequences. Statement 1 correctly identifies the rise of outsourcing as a major outcome of globalization and technological advancements, particularly in the information technology sector.  The availability of skilled manpower at competitive costs in India made it a hub for outsourcing services like BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), IT, and other knowledge-based services. This led to significant job creation and economic growth in these sectors.

Statement 2 is also accurate.  India's WTO membership opened up domestic markets to greater international trade and competition, creating both opportunities and challenges. While it increased market access for Indian goods and services, it also exposed the economy to global economic fluctuations and increased competition from foreign firms. This necessitates greater efficiency and competitiveness in various sectors. Options (a) and (b) are therefore incomplete and option (d) is entirely incorrect, highlighting the dual nature of India's experience with globalization.


**7. With reference to privatization in India (post-1991), consider the following statements:**

1.  Disinvestment, or the sale of public sector undertakings (PSUs), was undertaken to improve financial discipline, modernization, and attract foreign direct investment (FDI).
2.  The granting of "Navaratna" and "Miniratna" status to some PSUs aimed to improve their efficiency by granting them greater autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Privatization played a significant role in India's post-1991 economic reforms. Statement 1 accurately describes the rationale behind disinvestment.  The government aimed to improve the financial health and operational efficiency of PSUs through privatization, attracting private capital and expertise.  The sale of equity stakes in PSUs was also intended to generate revenue for the government and attract foreign direct investment.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The government introduced the "Navaratna" and "Miniratna" schemes to enhance the performance of selected PSUs. These schemes provided greater managerial and operational autonomy to these companies, allowing them to make quicker decisions and become more competitive.  This was a strategic move to improve efficiency without complete privatization. Options (a) and (b) are therefore incomplete, and option (d) is false, showcasing the government's multifaceted approach to improving the public sector's performance.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Amrit Kaal vision for India:**

1.  The Amrit Kaal vision focuses on achieving a developed India by 2047, encompassing economic growth, social progress, and national unity.
2. The "Panch Pran" (five pledges) of Amrit Kaal include a developed India, getting rid of colonial baggage, pride in heritage, unity, and citizen's duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Amrit Kaal, marking India's 75th year of independence and the journey towards its centenary, represents a long-term vision for national development. Statement 1 is accurate in its broad description.  The Amrit Kaal vision aims for a developed India by 2047, encompassing not just economic growth but also social progress, improved living standards, and national unity. This includes sustainable development goals and inclusive growth, ensuring all sections of society benefit from the nation's progress.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Prime Minister Modi articulated the "Panch Pran" (five pledges) as the guiding principles for Amrit Kaal. These include the commitment to a developed India; removing all vestiges of colonial mindset and slavery; taking pride in India's heritage and legacy; fostering unity and solidarity; and upholding the duties and responsibilities of citizens.  Options (a) and (b) are therefore incomplete, and option (d) is false, reflecting the core tenets of the Amrit Kaal vision.


**9. With reference to Inclusive Growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth aims for equitable distribution of economic benefits across all segments of society, irrespective of class, gender, or other factors.
2.  Strategies for inclusive growth include focusing on sectors where the poor work, using factors of production they possess, and reducing prices of goods they consume.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Inclusive growth has become a central theme in development economics, emphasizing the need for equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth. Statement 1 is accurate; inclusive growth seeks to ensure that the advantages of economic progress are not limited to a select few but are shared broadly across society. This means addressing inequalities based on various factors such as economic class, gender, caste, religion, and geographic location.

Statement 2 is equally correct.  Strategies to achieve inclusive growth focus on generating opportunities for the disadvantaged. This includes targeting sectors and regions where the poor are concentrated, leveraging their existing resources (e.g., unskilled labor), and implementing policies that keep essential goods affordable for low-income households.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, and option (d) is false, because both statements reflect fundamental aspects of inclusive growth.


**10. With reference to the challenges faced by Indian agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Decreasing public investment in agricultural infrastructure, coupled with the removal of subsidies, has increased production costs and affected small farmers disproportionately.
2.  Increased international competition following WTO membership and policy changes (reduction in import duties, removal of MSP) have adversely affected Indian farmers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Indian agriculture faces numerous challenges in the face of globalization and economic reforms. Statement 1 accurately highlights the impact of reduced public investment and subsidy removal.  Decreased government spending on irrigation, research, and extension services has hampered agricultural productivity.  Simultaneously, the removal of subsidies on inputs like fertilizers has increased the cost of production, particularly affecting small and marginal farmers who lack the resources to cope with higher costs.

Statement 2 is equally valid. India's WTO membership has exposed the agricultural sector to increased international competition.  The reduction in import duties on agricultural products and removal of minimum support prices (MSP) in some cases have made it difficult for Indian farmers to compete with subsidized agricultural products from other countries. This has led to price volatility and income insecurity for many farmers. Options (a) and (b) are thus incomplete, and option (d) is false, as both statements accurately describe significant challenges faced by Indian agriculture.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to India's Industrial Corridors, consider the following statements:**

1. The Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) is being developed in collaboration with Japan.
2.  The primary objective of establishing National Industrial Corridor Development Authority (NICDA) is to coordinate the development of all industrial corridors and integrate their development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While several industrial corridors involve international collaborations, the provided text does not specify Japan's involvement in the DMIC.  The text mentions collaborations in general but does not explicitly name a country for each corridor.  It's important to avoid making assumptions based on general knowledge; the answer must be explicitly stated in the provided text.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the NICDA is being established "to converge and integrate the development of all industrial corridors." This directly addresses the coordination and integration aspect mentioned in the statement.  The creation of NICDA is presented as a key strategy for the success of the industrial corridor initiative.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in India:**

1.  SEZs are treated as deemed foreign territory for the purpose of trade operations, duties, and tariffs, facilitating foreign direct investment and exports.
2. The SEZ Act 2005 mandates that all SEZ units must be net foreign exchange earners within one year of commencement of production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly defines SEZs as "specially delineated duty-free enclave[s] treated as a deemed foreign territory" to encourage FDI and exports. This accurately reflects the core purpose and operational framework of SEZs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clarifies that the net foreign exchange earning calculation is done "cumulatively for a period of five years," not within one year.  This subtle difference in timeframe makes the statement factually inaccurate. The five-year timeframe allows for a more realistic assessment of an SEZ's long-term contribution to the nation's foreign exchange reserves.


**3. With reference to the Sagarmala Project, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sagarmala initiative aims to reduce logistics costs for both domestic and EXIM cargo by maximizing infrastructure investment.
2.  The project primarily focuses on enhancing the capacity of major ports, neglecting minor ports in its development strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Sagarmala aims to reduce logistics costs with *minimal* infrastructure investment, not maximize it. This highlights the project's focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions enhancing the capacity of *both* major and minor ports. The project's comprehensive approach aims to leverage the potential of India's entire coastline and river network, not just major ports.  Ignoring a significant portion of the country's port infrastructure would contradict the project's stated goals and undermine its potential impact.


**4. With reference to India's economic development post-independence, consider the following statements:**

1. India's economic growth post-independence initially followed the classical pattern of transitioning from agriculture to industry, then to services.
2.  The share of agriculture in India's GDP was approximately 30% at the time of independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly notes that India's transition was an exception, moving directly from agriculture to services, bypassing a significant industrialization phase as seen in many other developing nations. This deviation from the classical model is a key characteristic of India's post-independence economic trajectory.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that the share of agriculture in India's GDP at independence was 55%, not 30%. This significant difference highlights the dominance of the agricultural sector in the early years of independent India and the challenges faced in diversifying the economy.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the "Make in India" initiative:**

1.  The initiative aims to increase the share of manufacturing in India's GDP from 15% to 25% by 2025 and create 100 million additional jobs by 2022.
2. One of the major challenges faced by the "Make in India" initiative is the high labour productivity of the Indian manufacturing sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states the targets of the "Make in India" initiative: increasing the manufacturing sector's share in GDP and creating a substantial number of jobs. These ambitious goals are central to the initiative's objectives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text highlights that India's manufacturing sector suffers from *low*, not high, labour productivity. This is presented as a major obstacle to achieving the "Make in India" goals. The low productivity underscores the need for skill development and technological advancements within the sector.


**6.  With reference to the challenges faced by India's food processing industry, consider the following statements:**

1. Inadequate infrastructure, including cold storage and warehousing facilities, is a major bottleneck for the growth of the food processing sector.
2. The Indian food processing industry has successfully developed innovative products and processing techniques of global stature, significantly impacting India's share in global food trade.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text identifies inadequate infrastructure as a significant challenge, hindering expansion and export potential.  The lack of proper cold chain facilities leads to substantial food wastage, impacting both farmers' income and the overall efficiency of the sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly points out that despite the presence of R&D institutions, India's share in global food trade reflects a lack of innovative products and processing techniques on a global scale. This indicates a gap between research and practical application, and a need for greater industry-academia collaboration.


**7. With reference to the comparison between India and China's economic development, consider the following statements:**

1. In 1978, China's per capita income was higher than India's.
2.  India's economic growth post-independence has been primarily driven by the growth of the manufacturing sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that in 1978, China's per capita income was *lower* than India's, a stark contrast to the current situation. This highlights the significant economic transformation China has undergone since then.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that India's economy has shifted directly from a predominantly agricultural base to a service-based economy, bypassing substantial industrial development, unlike China.  This emphasizes the unique developmental path of India compared to other nations.


**8.  Consider the following statements regarding the factors hindering India's manufacturing sector:**

1. Complicated labor laws and difficult land acquisition processes have created significant barriers for the growth of the manufacturing sector.
2.  India has consistently provided cheap and reliable electricity to manufacturing enterprises, thereby supporting their competitiveness in the global market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions complicated labor laws and lengthy land acquisition procedures as major obstacles to the growth of India's manufacturing sector. These factors increase costs and create uncertainties for businesses, hindering investment and expansion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the lack of cheap and consistent electricity supply is a significant challenge for manufacturing enterprises in India.  The unreliability and high cost of electricity directly affect the profitability and competitiveness of these businesses.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme's primary goal is to integrate small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.
2.  It offers financial assistance to impoverished farmers for cultivating specific crops.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a government initiative aimed at providing funding to micro/small units and entrepreneurs.  Its core objective is to promote entrepreneurship and job creation by facilitating access to credit for small businesses that traditionally lack access to formal banking channels.  This aligns directly with statement 1. Statement 2 is incorrect; PMMY is not specifically designed for agricultural lending, although some micro-entrepreneurs involved in agriculture might benefit from the scheme.  Several other government schemes specifically target agricultural credit needs.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the primary purpose of PMMY. The scheme's success lies in its ability to move small businesses from the informal to the formal sector, enhancing their financial stability and growth potential.  The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the scheme's focus or include irrelevant aspects.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the "Government's Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme" and "Gold Monetization Scheme":**

1.  These schemes aim to bring idle gold held by Indian households into the economy.
2.  They primarily aim to reduce India's dependence on gold imports.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are designed to mobilize gold reserves held by individuals and institutions within India.  The schemes encourage the public to convert their physical gold holdings into bonds or deposit gold in banks, increasing the country's gold reserves and bringing this idle asset into the formal financial system. This directly supports statement 1.  Furthermore, by reducing the demand for physical gold, these schemes indirectly lessen India's reliance on gold imports, thus impacting the balance of payments. This supports statement 2.  Reducing import dependency is a significant benefit, and while not the sole objective, it is a crucial outcome of these initiatives.  The schemes are complementary, aiming to address both the underutilization of domestic gold resources and the import burden. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while (d) is entirely inaccurate.


**3. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1. NPCI's primary function is to promote financial inclusion within the country.
2.  RuPay, a card payment network, was launched by NPCI.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) plays a crucial role in India's financial infrastructure.  NPCI's initiatives, such as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), aim to make digital payments more accessible and affordable, thereby promoting financial inclusion by bringing a larger segment of the population into the formal financial system.  This directly addresses statement 1.  Additionally, NPCI is the entity behind RuPay, India's domestic card payment network, designed to reduce reliance on international payment systems and provide an alternative for domestic transactions.  This confirms statement 2.  Therefore, both statements correctly describe significant aspects of NPCI's functions and achievements.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while (d) is entirely false.


**4. With reference to Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SFBs primarily provide credit to small business units.
2.  They are mandated to encourage young entrepreneurs, particularly in rural areas.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Small Finance Banks (SFBs) were introduced in India to address the credit needs of underserved segments of the population.  Their primary focus is on lending to small businesses, micro and small enterprises, and the unorganized sector, contributing significantly to the growth of the small business sector. This directly supports statement 1.  Additionally, while not their sole purpose, SFBs play a role in promoting entrepreneurship by providing access to credit and banking services in rural and semi-urban areas, thereby encouraging young entrepreneurs to start businesses. This aligns with statement 2.  The SFB model aims to create a more inclusive financial ecosystem, fostering both economic development and regional balance. While they also serve other segments, their focus on small businesses and rural entrepreneurship makes both statements correct.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR):**

1.  The MDR is a charge levied on a merchant by a bank for accepting payments through the bank's debit cards.
2.  The Government provides incentives to merchants for promoting digital payments through MDR reductions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a fee charged by banks to merchants for processing debit and credit card transactions.  It covers the cost of processing the payment and is a significant factor in the adoption of digital payment methods by merchants. This directly supports statement 1. Statement 2 is partially true in that the government has implemented policies to reduce MDR charges to encourage digital transactions, but it is not accurate to say that these reductions are direct "incentives" in the form of payments *to* merchants. The government's role is primarily to influence the MDR structure through regulatory measures, not to provide direct financial incentives to merchants.  Therefore, only statement 1 provides a complete and accurate description of the core function of the MDR.


**6. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1. Legal tender money is money that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of debts.
2.  Legal tender money in India includes only metallic currency.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Legal tender money refers to currency that a creditor is legally required to accept as payment for a debt.  This is a fundamental aspect of a country's monetary system, ensuring that transactions can be settled using designated legal currency. This directly addresses statement 1. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While metallic currency might be part of a country's legal tender, in many modern economies, including India, legal tender also includes banknotes and other forms of currency issued by the central bank. The definition of legal tender is broader than just metallic coins, encompassing all forms of currency officially designated as such by the government.  Thus, only statement 1 correctly identifies the key characteristic of legal tender money.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The RBI manages and services both Government of India Securities and State Government Securities.
2. Treasury bills are issued only by the Government of India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plays a central role in managing the government's debt.  While the RBI does manage and service Government of India Securities, its involvement with State Government Securities is limited.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Treasury bills, a short-term borrowing instrument, are primarily issued by the central government (in India's case, the Government of India). State governments typically have their own borrowing mechanisms. Thus, statement 2 is correct.  The RBI's functions are primarily focused on the central government's financial management, though its influence extends to the broader financial system.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects RBI's role in relation to treasury bills.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):**

1. CAR is the amount banks must maintain as their own funds to offset potential losses from non-repayment of dues by account-holders.
2.  Individual banks determine their CAR levels independently.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a crucial regulatory requirement for banks globally.  It mandates that banks maintain a certain level of capital (their own funds) relative to their risk-weighted assets. This capital acts as a buffer against potential losses from loan defaults and other risks. This accurately describes statement 1. Statement 2 is incorrect; CAR is not determined by individual banks but is set by regulatory authorities (in India, the Reserve Bank of India) based on international standards (like Basel norms) and considerations of systemic risk.  The regulatory framework ensures that all banks maintain a minimum CAR to maintain financial stability and prevent systemic failures.  Hence, only statement 1 is correct.


**9. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Deposits are included in the assets of a commercial bank.
2. Advances (loans) are included in the assets of a commercial bank.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Commercial banks' balance sheets show assets and liabilities.  Deposits represent funds held by the bank *on behalf* of customers; they are liabilities for the bank, not assets. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Advances (loans) represent funds lent out by the bank to borrowers; these are assets for the bank because they represent claims on future payments.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  A bank's assets are what it owns, while its liabilities are what it owes to others.  The core business of a bank involves transforming liabilities (deposits) into assets (loans). Only statement 2 correctly identifies a component of a bank's assets.


**10. With reference to factors that mitigate currency crisis risk in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Increasing government expenditure significantly reduces the risk of a currency crisis.
2. Remittances from Indians abroad contribute to reducing the risk of a currency crisis.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A currency crisis occurs when a country's currency experiences a sharp and rapid devaluation.  Several factors influence a country's vulnerability to such crises.  Statement 1 is incorrect; increasing government expenditure, particularly deficit spending, can actually *increase* the risk of a currency crisis by putting pressure on the balance of payments and potentially reducing investor confidence.  Statement 2 is correct; remittances from Indians working abroad represent an inflow of foreign exchange, bolstering the country's foreign exchange reserves and enhancing its ability to withstand external shocks, thereby reducing the risk of a currency crisis.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately identifies a factor that helps mitigate currency crisis risk in India.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding measures to counter a decline in the Indian rupee:**

1.  Easing conditions for external commercial borrowing (ECB) helps stop the rupee's slide.
2.  Following an expansionary monetary policy is effective in stopping the rupee's slide.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

When a currency depreciates, governments and central banks may take various measures to counter the decline. Statement 1 is incorrect; easing ECB conditions might actually worsen the situation by increasing demand for foreign currency, thereby increasing pressure on the rupee. Statement 2 is also incorrect; an expansionary monetary policy, which increases money supply, can lead to inflation and reduce investor confidence, potentially accelerating the rupee's decline.  Measures to curb a falling currency usually involve policies that increase demand for the domestic currency or reduce demand for foreign currency.  These often involve contractionary monetary policies, not expansionary ones.  Therefore, both statements suggest actions that are generally counterproductive in stabilizing a falling currency.


**12. With reference to the money multiplier, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) increases the money multiplier.
2.  An increase in the banking habit of the population increases the money multiplier.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The money multiplier is a key concept in monetary economics, representing the potential expansion of money supply through the banking system. Statement 1 is incorrect; an increase in the CRR (the percentage of deposits banks must keep with the central bank) reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thereby *decreasing* the money multiplier.  Statement 2 is correct; as more people use banks, the amount of money deposited increases, and the banks can lend out more money, thus increasing the money multiplier.  The money multiplier is directly related to the fraction of deposits that banks can lend out (which is inversely related to CRR).  Only statement 2 correctly identifies a factor that leads to an increase in the money multiplier.


**13. With reference to actions that might provide immunity to India from a global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1. Maintaining full capital account convertibility offers significant immunity.
2. Not depending on short-term foreign borrowings provides some immunity.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Global financial crises can have severe impacts on national economies.  Statement 1 is incorrect; full capital account convertibility, while offering some benefits in normal times, can increase vulnerability during a crisis as it exposes the economy to rapid capital flight. Statement 2 is correct; reliance on short-term foreign borrowing makes a country highly susceptible to sudden shifts in global capital flows during a crisis.  Reducing this dependence enhances resilience.  Managing external debt prudently and diversifying sources of funding are crucial for mitigating the impact of global financial shocks.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately identifies an action that can provide some immunity from a financial crisis.


**14. Consider the following statements about the impact of withdrawing cash from a demand deposit account:**

1. Withdrawing Rs. 1,00,000 in cash reduces the aggregate money supply by exactly Rs. 1,00,000.
2.  Withdrawing Rs. 1,00,000 in cash increases the aggregate money supply by more than Rs. 1,00,000.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The immediate impact of cash withdrawal on the money supply is not straightforward. Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the withdrawal reduces the amount of money held in demand deposits, the overall effect on the money supply depends on factors like the money multiplier and how the withdrawn cash is subsequently used.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The aggregate money supply might decrease, increase, or remain relatively unchanged depending on how the withdrawn cash is used in the economy. If the cash is simply held, the money supply will decrease. If the cash is used in transactions, the impact will depend on various factors. Therefore, neither statement provides an accurate description of the immediate impact of cash withdrawal on the money supply.


**15. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. KCC provides short-term credit for the construction of family houses.
2. KCC provides short-term credit for post-harvest expenses.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme is a crucial initiative to provide timely credit to farmers in India. Statement 1 is incorrect; KCC primarily focuses on agricultural credit needs, and the construction of family houses typically falls under different housing schemes. Statement 2 is correct; KCC provides short-term credit for various agricultural purposes, including post-harvest expenses such as transportation, storage, and processing of agricultural produce.  This is a critical aspect of ensuring farmers receive fair prices for their produce and can manage their finances effectively.  Only statement 2 accurately reflects a key function of the KCC scheme.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding financial instruments in the Indian economy:**

1. Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note.
2. Certificates of Deposit are long-term instruments issued by the Reserve Bank of India to corporations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Various financial instruments are used in the Indian economy to facilitate borrowing and lending. Statement 1 is correct; commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by large corporations to raise short-term funds from the market.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term (not long-term) borrowing instruments issued by banks (not the RBI) to attract deposits.  The RBI does not directly issue CDs.  Understanding the characteristics of these instruments is important for analyzing the functioning of the financial markets. Only statement 1 accurately describes the nature of commercial paper.


**17. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI is primarily investment through capital instruments in listed companies.
2. FDI is considered a largely non-debt-creating capital flow.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a significant source of capital inflow for many countries, including India. Statement 1 is incorrect; while FDI can involve investment in listed companies, it encompasses a broader range of investments, including setting up new ventures, acquiring existing businesses, and participating in joint ventures.  It is not limited to listed companies. Statement 2 is correct; FDI is primarily equity investment, representing a direct ownership stake in a company, unlike portfolio investment or loans, which are debt-creating.  This makes it a more stable and long-term form of capital inflow.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately captures a key characteristic of FDI in India.


**18. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Government appoints the Governor of the RBI.
2. The RBI Governor's authority is derived solely from the RBI Act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is India's central bank, with significant autonomy but also under the ultimate authority of the government. Statement 1 is correct; the Governor of the RBI is appointed by the Central Government of India. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the RBI Act provides the legal framework for the RBI's operations and the Governor's powers, the Governor's actions are also subject to the overall policy directives of the government, particularly in matters of public interest.  The RBI's autonomy is not absolute but is balanced with the government's responsibility for overall economic policy.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**19. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. UCBs are supervised and regulated by local boards established by State Governments.
2. UCBs can issue both equity shares and preference shares.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are a segment of the Indian banking sector with a unique structure and regulatory framework. Statement 1 is incorrect; while State Governments have some oversight, the primary regulatory authority for UCBs is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not local boards.  The RBI's role includes supervision and regulation of UCBs to ensure their financial stability and compliance with banking norms. Statement 2 is correct; UCBs, like other companies, can issue both equity shares (representing ownership) and preference shares (representing a form of debt) to raise capital.  This is a common feature of their corporate structure. Only statement 2 accurately describes a characteristic of UCBs.


**20. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following statements:**

1. Actions of the United States Federal Reserve significantly influence Indian Government Bond Yields.
2. Inflation in India has no influence on Indian Government Bond Yields.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Government bond yields reflect the return investors expect from holding government bonds. Several factors influence these yields. Statement 1 is correct; global factors, including the actions of the US Federal Reserve (the US central bank), significantly impact global interest rates and capital flows, which in turn affect the demand for Indian government bonds and their yields.  Statement 2 is incorrect; domestic inflation is a major factor influencing bond yields.  Higher inflation typically leads to higher yields as investors demand higher returns to compensate for the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects a key influence on Indian government bond yields.


**21. Consider the following regarding components that can be included in Foreign Direct Investments (FDI):**

1. Foreign currency convertible bonds are a component of FDI.
2. Non-resident external deposits are a component of FDI.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) represents long-term investment made by a foreign entity to gain control or influence over a domestic company or asset. Statement 1 is incorrect; foreign currency convertible bonds are typically considered a form of portfolio investment, not FDI, as they do not necessarily give the investor control or significant influence over the issuing company. Statement 2 is also incorrect; non-resident external deposits are simply deposits held by foreign individuals or entities in domestic banks; they do not represent direct investment in domestic companies or assets.  FDI involves more than just capital flows; it implies a lasting interest and a degree of management control.  Therefore, neither statement accurately describes a component of FDI.


**22. With reference to the effects of currency devaluation, consider the following statements:**

1. Currency devaluation necessarily improves the trade balance.
2. Currency devaluation necessarily increases the foreign value of the domestic currency.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Currency devaluation is a policy tool used to make a country's exports cheaper and imports more expensive.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while devaluation aims to improve the trade balance by boosting exports and reducing imports, the actual outcome is not guaranteed.  The effectiveness depends on various factors, including the elasticity of demand for exports and imports, and the reaction of other countries.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; devaluation, by definition, *decreases* the value of the domestic currency in relation to foreign currencies.  It makes the domestic currency cheaper in the foreign exchange market.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects a guaranteed outcome of currency devaluation.


**23. With reference to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. Expansionary fiscal policies can increase demand-pull inflation.
2. Rising interest rates are a major cause of demand-pull inflation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation arises when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply, leading to a rise in the general price level. Statement 1 is correct; expansionary fiscal policies, such as increased government spending or tax cuts, can boost aggregate demand, potentially leading to demand-pull inflation if supply cannot keep pace.  Statement 2 is incorrect; rising interest rates are typically used by central banks to *curb* inflation by reducing aggregate demand.  Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, discouraging spending and investment.  Therefore, only statement 1 correctly identifies a factor that can contribute to demand-pull inflation.



**1. With reference to the distribution of India's workforce across sectors in 1999-2000, consider the following statements:**

1.  The primary sector, encompassing agriculture and mining, employed over three-quarters of the rural workforce.
2.  The service sector constituted the largest employment segment in urban areas, exceeding 60% of the urban workforce.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that in 1999-2000, more than three-fourths of the workforce in rural India was engaged in the primary sector (agriculture and mining). This directly supports statement 1.  Furthermore, the text clearly indicates that approximately 60% of urban workers were employed in the service sector, making statement 2 also correct.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the employment distribution in India during that period.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the dominance of the primary sector in rural employment and the service sector's significant role in urban employment, both of which are substantiated by the given data.


**2. With reference to the changing structure of employment in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The growth rate of employment consistently lagged behind the growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) between 1960 and 2000.
2.  In the late 1990s, employment growth significantly decelerated, leading to a widening gap between GDP growth and employment growth, a phenomenon often referred to as "jobless growth."

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions that from 1960-2000, India's GDP grew at a rate higher than its employment growth, indicating a consistent lag in employment growth relative to GDP growth. This directly supports statement 1.  The text further highlights a decline in employment growth in the late 1990s, reaching levels observed in the early stages of planning, and notes the widening gap between GDP and employment growth, a situation described as "jobless growth."  This directly validates statement 2. Consequently, both statements accurately reflect the trends in employment and GDP growth in India during the specified period.  The other options are incorrect as they do not account for both the consistent lag and the specific deceleration in employment growth observed in the late 1990s.


**3. With reference to the informalization of the Indian workforce, consider the following statements:**

1.  The proportion of casual laborers in India's workforce has increased significantly over the last three decades (1972-2000).
2.  Workers in the formal sector, primarily comprising public sector employees and private sector establishments employing 10 or more hired workers, enjoy comprehensive social security benefits.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the proportion of casual wage laborers in India increased from 1972 to 2000. This directly supports statement 1. The text further defines the formal sector and explicitly mentions that formal sector workers enjoy social security benefits provided by the government through its labor laws. This validates statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of informalization and the contrast between formal and informal sector employment in India. The other options are incorrect, as they fail to capture the dual reality of increasing casual labor and the relative protection afforded to formal sector employees.


**4. With reference to the occupational structure of India during the colonial period, consider the following statements:**

1. The agricultural sector consistently accounted for 70-75% of the total workforce.
2.  Significant regional variations existed in the occupational structure, with some regions showing a decline in agricultural dependence and a rise in manufacturing and service sector employment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the agricultural sector constituted the largest share of the workforce during the colonial period, typically ranging from 70-75%. This directly supports statement 1. The text also points out the presence of regional variations in the occupational structure, with some areas experiencing a decrease in agricultural dependence and a corresponding increase in employment in manufacturing and service sectors. This confirms statement 2.  Thus, both statements are correct in describing the occupational structure's characteristics during the colonial era. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to capture the complete picture of the colonial occupational structure, which is characterized by both the agricultural sector's dominance and the existence of significant regional disparities.


**5. With reference to the growth of employment and GDP in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The primary sector's share in GDP significantly decreased from 1950-51 to 1990-91, whereas the service sector's share increased substantially during the same period.
2. The industrial sector's share in GDP showed a considerable increase between 1950-51 and 1990-91, reflecting the growth of the industrial sector during this period.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided data shows a decrease in the agriculture sector's share of GDP from 59% in 1950-51 to 34.9% in 1990-91, while the service sector's share increased from 28% to 40.5% during the same period. This directly validates statement 1. The data also reveals an increase in the industrial sector's share of GDP from 13% in 1950-51 to 24.6% in 1990-91, demonstrating the growth of this sector. This confirms statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the changing sectoral composition of India's GDP between 1950-51 and 1990-91.  Other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the concurrent shifts in the shares of the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors in India's GDP during this period.


**6. With reference to India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rural areas in India lag significantly behind in access to basic infrastructure compared to urban areas, with a substantial portion of rural households lacking access to electricity and safe drinking water.
2.  India's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP is significantly lower than that of several other countries, such as China and Indonesia, hindering its economic development.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage details the significant infrastructure deficit in rural India, highlighting the low percentage of households with electricity connections and access to safe drinking water. This directly supports statement 1.  The passage further compares India's infrastructure investment (5% of GDP) unfavorably with that of other nations like China and Indonesia, indicating that inadequate infrastructure investment acts as a constraint on India's economic growth. This supports statement 2. Thus, both statements accurately reflect the state of infrastructure development and investment in India.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to capture the dual challenge of both rural-urban disparity and the relatively low level of infrastructure investment in India compared to other nations.


**7. With reference to the "Make in India" initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initiative aims to significantly increase the manufacturing sector's growth rate and its share in India's GDP.
2.  Challenges faced by the "Make in India" initiative include low labor productivity, insufficient skills in the workforce, and complicated labor laws.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the "Make in India" initiative targets a substantial increase in the manufacturing sector's growth rate (12-14% per annum) and its share in GDP (from 15% to 25% by 2025). This directly supports statement 1. The passage also identifies several challenges facing the initiative, including low labor productivity, insufficient skills, and complex labor laws. This validates statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the goals and challenges of the "Make in India" program. Other options are incorrect as they do not consider both the ambitious targets and the substantial hurdles the initiative faces in achieving its objectives.


**8. With reference to the evolution of India's industrial policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 classified industries into three categories based on ownership: state-owned, mixed (public-private), and private.
2.  The license raj, a system of requiring government licenses for industrial activity, was implemented to promote industrial development in backward regions and regulate production.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage correctly describes the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 as classifying industries into three categories based on ownership: state-owned, mixed (where the private sector could supplement state efforts), and private.  This directly supports statement 1.  The passage also explains that the license raj was used to promote industries in backward regions by offering incentives and to regulate production to ensure it met the economy's needs. This supports statement 2. Consequently, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of India's industrial policy evolution. Other options are incorrect because they fail to fully capture the categorization of industries under the 1956 resolution and the dual purpose of the license raj in regional development and production regulation.


**9. With reference to the role of the government in employment generation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The government's role in employment generation includes direct employment through government departments and enterprises as well as indirect employment generation through increased output in government-owned companies, stimulating demand in related private sector industries.
2.  The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) of 2005 aims to provide guaranteed wage employment for a specified number of days to adult members of rural households willing to undertake unskilled manual work.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly explains that the government generates employment directly through its various departments and public sector undertakings (PSUs). Increased output in government enterprises, in turn, leads to increased demand for inputs and products from private companies, resulting in indirect employment generation. This supports statement 1.  The passage also specifically mentions the NREGA 2005 and its aim to guarantee a certain number of days of wage employment to rural households.  This directly supports statement 2.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe the government's multifaceted approach to employment generation in India. The other options fail to acknowledge the dual nature of the government's role—direct employment and the indirect stimulus to the private sector—along with the specific example of NREGA.


**10. With reference to the characteristics of unemployment in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Open unemployment, where individuals actively seek work but cannot find it, is a significant form of unemployment in India.
2.  Disguised unemployment, where more people are employed in an activity than are actually needed, is particularly prevalent in the agricultural sector.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text defines open unemployment and states that it is a prevalent form of unemployment in India. This supports statement 1. The passage also describes disguised unemployment, where more workers are employed than are necessary, as a common phenomenon in Indian agriculture. This supports statement 2. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect different types of unemployment found in India.  The other options are incorrect, as they fail to acknowledge the existence of both open and disguised unemployment as significant features of the Indian employment landscape.


**1. With reference to the concept of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing prices of identical baskets of goods and services across different countries, adjusting for differences in price levels.
2.  India's ranking as the world's sixth-largest economy is consistently higher when measured using PPP dollars compared to nominal exchange rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach. It aims to determine the relative value of currencies by comparing the prices of identical goods and services in different countries.  The calculation adjusts for differences in price levels between nations, providing a more accurate comparison of economic output than nominal exchange rates, which are often influenced by short-term market fluctuations.

Statement 2 is also correct.  India's economic size, when measured using PPP, often surpasses its ranking based on nominal GDP. This is because PPP accounts for the lower cost of goods and services in India compared to wealthier nations.  The lower cost of living means that the same amount of money buys more in India, thus inflating its GDP when viewed through the lens of PPP.  While the precise ranking may fluctuate slightly depending on the year and methodology used, the general principle holds true:  India's PPP-adjusted GDP is significantly larger than its nominal GDP.


**2. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPI assigns a greater weight to food items compared to the WPI, reflecting the higher proportion of household income spent on food, especially among lower-income groups.
2. The WPI primarily focuses on the prices of goods at the wholesale level and does not fully capture changes in service sector prices, unlike the CPI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The CPI (Consumer Price Index) is designed to reflect the cost of living for consumers.  In India, a substantial portion of household expenditure, particularly for lower-income households, is dedicated to food. Therefore, the CPI gives a heavier weighting to food items compared to the WPI. This accurately reflects the impact of food price changes on the overall cost of living for a larger segment of the population.  The WPI, while encompassing food prices, does not reflect the same proportional importance as it considers a broader basket of goods traded at the wholesale level.

Statement 2 is also correct. The WPI (Wholesale Price Index) tracks price changes for goods at the wholesale stage of the market. It is a less comprehensive measure of inflation than the CPI because it doesn't adequately capture price changes in the services sector, which forms a significant part of many economies, including India's. The CPI, on the other hand, includes both goods and services, providing a more holistic picture of inflationary pressures on the consumer.


**3. With reference to the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in NEER indicates an appreciation of the rupee against a basket of other currencies, reflecting changes in nominal exchange rates.
2.  A rise in REER suggests an improvement in a country's trade competitiveness, implying that its goods and services are becoming relatively cheaper compared to its trading partners.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is an index that tracks the value of a currency against a weighted average of other currencies.  An increase in NEER signifies that the rupee has appreciated—its value has risen compared to the other currencies in the basket. This is a purely nominal measure, meaning it only reflects changes in the exchange rates themselves, without adjusting for inflation or other economic factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is a more comprehensive measure than NEER, as it adjusts for differences in inflation rates between countries.  A rise in REER doesn't necessarily imply improved trade competitiveness.  While a decrease in REER generally indicates improved competitiveness (goods and services becoming cheaper relative to trading partners), an increase suggests the opposite—a loss of competitiveness due to factors such as higher domestic inflation.  Therefore, a rise in REER doesn't automatically translate to better trade prospects.


**4. With reference to market demand for a good, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the price of a substitute good will lead to a rise in the market demand for the good in question.
2. A decrease in the price of a complementary good will typically increase the market demand for the good in question.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of each other. If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will likely switch to the relatively cheaper alternative, leading to an increase in the demand for the original good. For example, if the price of coffee rises, some consumers may switch to tea, increasing the demand for tea.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Complementary goods are those that are consumed together.  A decrease in the price of a complementary good will *increase* the demand for that good, but this will *increase*, not decrease, the demand for the good it complements. For example, a decrease in the price of printers will increase the demand for printers, and also increase the demand for printer ink.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy's growth and development, consider the following statements:**

1.  High savings rates alone guarantee significant increases in output and economic development.
2. A high capital-output ratio indicates that a large amount of capital investment is needed to generate a unit increase in output, hindering efficient resource allocation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While high savings rates are essential for capital formation, they don't automatically translate to significant output increases or economic development.  Other factors, such as efficient resource allocation, technological advancements, and effective governance, play equally crucial roles.  Simply accumulating savings without investing them productively won't lead to substantial economic growth.  For example, a country might have high savings but lack the infrastructure or skilled labor to utilize those savings effectively.

Statement 2 is correct.  The capital-output ratio measures the amount of capital required to produce one unit of output. A high capital-output ratio indicates that substantial capital investment is necessary to generate a small increase in output. This can be a sign of inefficiency, suggesting that resources are not being used optimally, potentially due to technological limitations, poor management, or other bottlenecks.  A high capital-output ratio implies that economic growth may be slower than expected despite high levels of investment.


**6. With reference to the characteristics of  "Systemically Important Institutions" (SIIs) in India's financial sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  SIIs are identified based solely on their asset size, with a uniform threshold applied across all types of financial institutions.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the sole authority responsible for identifying and designating all SIIs in India's financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While asset size is a significant factor in identifying Systemically Important Institutions (SIIs), the criteria aren't uniform across all financial sectors.  Different regulatory bodies, such as the RBI for banks and NBFCs, IRDAI for insurers, and SEBI for financial market infrastructures, use different criteria based on the specific nature of the institutions and the risks they pose to the financial system's stability.  For example, for banks, asset size is a major criterion, but for insurers, factors like premium underwritten and assets under management are also considered.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Multiple regulatory bodies in India are involved in identifying and designating SIIs.  The RBI plays a crucial role for banks and NBFCs, but the IRDAI identifies systemically important insurers, and SEBI identifies systemically important financial market infrastructures.  This division of responsibility reflects the diverse nature of the financial sector and ensures that each segment is appropriately regulated.


**7. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI primarily involves investments in equity shares, exceeding 10% of a listed company's equity capital, whereas FPI typically involves investments below this threshold.
2.  All FDI inflows into India require prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is characterized by a significant level of control or influence by the foreign investor in the Indian company's operations.  This typically involves investments exceeding a certain threshold (usually 10%) in the equity capital of a listed company or investments in unlisted companies.  Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), on the other hand, involves investments in the capital instruments of a company without the intent of acquiring significant management control.  FPI investments are usually below the threshold for FDI.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While certain FDI proposals require government approval, many FDI inflows fall under the "automatic route," which doesn't necessitate prior RBI approval.  The RBI's role primarily involves monitoring and reporting of FDI inflows, not granting prior approval for all investments.  The need for government approval varies depending on the sector and investment size.


**8. With reference to Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. PM-KISAN provides an annual income support of ₹6,000 to all eligible farmer families, irrespective of their landholding size or agricultural output.
2.  The scheme is entirely funded by the Central Government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The PM-KISAN scheme aims to provide income support to small and marginal farmers. A key feature is that the benefit is provided to all eligible farmer families, regardless of their landholding size or the amount of agricultural produce they generate.  This unconditional income support is designed to offer a safety net and improve the farmers' financial stability.

Statement 2 is also correct. PM-KISAN is a Central Sector scheme, meaning it is fully funded by the Government of India.  There is no state-level contribution or sharing of the financial burden.  The funds are directly transferred to the beneficiaries' bank accounts.


**9. With reference to the  "Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan" (PM-AASHA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-AASHA  includes a Price Support Scheme (PSS) where procurement of pulses, oilseeds, and copra is undertaken by designated government agencies, with the central government bearing procurement costs.
2. The Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) under PM-AASHA involves direct payment of the difference between the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the market price to pre-registered farmers selling their produce through transparent auction processes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The PM-AASHA scheme includes a Price Support Scheme (PSS) to ensure remunerative prices to farmers for their produce. Under the PSS, government agencies, such as NAFED and FCI, procure pulses, oilseeds, and copra at the Minimum Support Price (MSP). The central government bears the costs associated with procurement, storage, and transportation.  This mechanism provides a safety net for farmers when market prices fall below the MSP.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) is another crucial component of PM-AASHA.  Under PDPS, the government doesn't physically procure the crops. Instead, it directly compensates pre-registered farmers for the difference between the MSP and the actual market price they receive for their produce sold through a transparent auction system.  This direct payment mechanism ensures that farmers receive at least the MSP, even if market prices are lower.


**10. With reference to the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) – UDAN, consider the following statements:**

1. RCS aims to develop underutilized airports and airstrips across India, primarily focusing on connecting smaller towns and cities to major metropolitan areas.
2. The scheme involves fare capping for a portion of the seats on RCS routes and provides Viability Gap Funding (VGF) to airlines to make these routes financially viable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) – UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) is a flagship initiative of the Indian government aimed at improving regional air connectivity.  The primary goal is to connect smaller towns and cities, many of which previously lacked air service, to major hubs.  This involves developing existing underutilized airports and airstrips and even constructing new ones, enhancing accessibility and promoting regional growth.

Statement 2 is also correct.  To stimulate demand and ensure the financial viability of RCS routes, the scheme incorporates two key strategies.  First, it mandates fare capping for a certain percentage of seats on these routes, keeping air travel affordable for the masses.  Second, it provides Viability Gap Funding (VGF) to airlines operating on these routes, partially offsetting their operational costs and making the routes attractive for commercial airlines, even though they might not be initially profitable without government support.  This support is crucial to making air travel more accessible to people in smaller towns and cities.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the challenges faced by the Indian manufacturing sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  Complex land acquisition procedures and limited land availability per capita have hindered the establishment of large-scale manufacturing units.
2.  High freight costs and inadequate transportation infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, have increased the cost of production and reduced competitiveness.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect significant obstacles hindering the growth of India's manufacturing sector.  Statement 1 correctly points out the issue of land acquisition.  India's high population density leads to limited land availability, and complex bureaucratic processes further complicate the acquisition of land for industrial purposes. This contrasts sharply with countries like China, where land acquisition for industrial projects is often more streamlined.  This difficulty in acquiring land prevents the establishment of large-scale manufacturing units, which require extensive land areas for operations.

Statement 2 highlights the problem of inefficient and expensive transportation.  India's transportation infrastructure, while improving, still lags behind many other nations. High freight costs due to poor road and rail connectivity significantly increase the cost of production for Indian manufacturers, making their products less competitive in both domestic and international markets.  The lack of efficient port management further exacerbates this issue, leading to delays and increased costs in the import and export of goods.  The costliest freight rates globally hinder the efficiency of Indian manufacturing enterprises, impacting their ability to compete with countries like China, Japan, and South Korea.  Therefore, both statements are accurate representations of the challenges faced by the Indian manufacturing sector.


**2. With reference to the shift in India's economic structure, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's economy has transitioned from a predominantly agricultural sector to a services-dominated sector, bypassing significant industrialization in between.
2.  The growth of the Information Technology (IT) and IT-enabled services sector has been a primary driver of this economic transformation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a unique aspect of India's economic development. Unlike many other nations that followed a pattern of agricultural to industrial to services dominance, India experienced a relatively rapid shift from an agricultural economy to a services-based economy, without a proportionally large intermediate phase of industrial development. This is largely due to factors like bureaucratic hurdles in setting up manufacturing units, land acquisition difficulties, and complex labor laws.  The lack of robust industrialization in India's development trajectory is a significant point of analysis for economists and policymakers.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the IT and IT-enabled services sector as a key engine of this transformation.  The rapid growth of this sector, fueled by factors such as a large pool of skilled English-speaking labor and the global demand for IT services, has significantly contributed to India's overall economic growth and the shift towards a services-based economy. The rise of the IT sector not only generated substantial employment but also attracted significant foreign investment, further boosting economic activity.  Therefore, both statements are correct and reflect key aspects of India's economic evolution.


**3. With reference to the role of cooperatives in rural development, consider the following statements:**

1.  The success of milk cooperatives in Gujarat and other parts of India demonstrates the potential of cooperatives to transform rural economies and benefit both farmers and consumers.
2.  Challenges faced by cooperatives in recent times include inadequate farmer membership, weak linkages between marketing and processing cooperatives, and inefficient financial management.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 highlights the positive impact of cooperatives, particularly milk cooperatives, on rural development in India. The success of 'Operation Flood' and the growth of milk cooperatives in Gujarat serve as prime examples of how cooperatives can empower farmers by providing them with better market access and fair pricing, leading to improved incomes and livelihoods. This model has been replicated across various states, contributing significantly to rural economic growth and improving the lives of millions of farmers and their families.  The success is a testament to the power of cooperative models in improving agricultural productivity and market access.

Statement 2 acknowledges the challenges that cooperatives face in their operations.  These challenges include issues such as limited membership, resulting in a reduced ability to influence market dynamics and achieve economies of scale.  The lack of effective coordination between marketing and processing cooperatives often leads to inefficiencies and reduced profits for farmers. Additionally, poor financial management practices within some cooperatives contribute to their instability and hinder their long-term sustainability.  Addressing these challenges is crucial for ensuring the continued success and effectiveness of cooperatives in rural development.  Therefore, both statements offer a balanced perspective on the role and challenges of cooperatives in rural India.


**4. With reference to inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Inclusive growth aims to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are equitably shared across all segments of the population, irrespective of their socioeconomic background, gender, caste, or religion.
2.  Challenges to achieving inclusive growth in India include persistent inequalities in agriculture, employment quality, human development indicators, and regional disparities.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly defines the core concept of inclusive growth.  It goes beyond simply increasing the overall GDP and emphasizes the equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth.  This means ensuring that marginalized and vulnerable groups, including those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, women, members of lower castes, and religious minorities, participate in and benefit from the economic progress of the nation.  The concept explicitly addresses the need for social justice and equity alongside economic growth.

Statement 2 accurately highlights the obstacles to achieving inclusive growth in India. Despite significant economic progress, India continues to grapple with substantial inequalities.  Low agricultural growth disproportionately affects rural populations, and low-quality employment growth often fails to provide adequate income and security for a large segment of the workforce.  Disparities in human development indicators, such as access to education and healthcare, further exacerbate existing inequalities.  Significant regional disparities in economic development also contribute to the challenge of ensuring inclusive growth. Addressing these issues requires targeted interventions and policies to ensure that the fruits of economic growth reach all sections of society.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the essence and challenges of inclusive growth in the Indian context.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy’s post-2014 performance, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Plug and Play" approach aims to minimize bureaucratic hurdles and red tape for private businesses, facilitating faster and easier establishment of enterprises.
2.  The "Panch Pran" of Amrit Kaal outlines five key commitments for India's development over the next 25 years, focused on achieving a developed India by 2047.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the "Plug and Play" approach as a policy initiative aimed at simplifying the process of setting up businesses in India. The intention is to reduce bureaucratic obstacles and streamline regulatory procedures to make it easier for private sector investment and entrepreneurship to thrive. This approach, if successful, would significantly reduce the time and effort required to establish and operate businesses.  This contrasts with previous periods characterized by extensive licensing and permits ("license raj").

Statement 2 correctly describes the "Panch Pran" (five pledges) as the core commitments for India's development during the "Amrit Kaal" – the 25-year period leading up to India's 100th anniversary of independence in 2047. These commitments represent a vision for a developed India and encompass various aspects of national development, aiming to address social and economic challenges and build a stronger and more prosperous nation.  The "Panch Pran" emphasizes national development goals and the role of citizens in achieving them.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key policy initiatives and goals of the Indian government.


**6. With reference to agricultural marketing in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The government's intervention in agricultural markets includes the assurance of Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for certain agricultural products.
2.  Despite government interventions, private trade remains the dominant force in agricultural markets in India, handling a significantly larger share of agricultural products than government agencies and cooperatives.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes one aspect of the government's role in agricultural marketing.  The government sets Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for several key agricultural commodities to ensure a minimum price for farmers' produce. This policy aims to safeguard farmers' income and protect them from price volatility in the market.  However, the effectiveness of MSPs in achieving their intended goal is a subject of ongoing debate.

Statement 2 correctly points out the dominance of private trade in agricultural markets.  Despite government efforts to improve market access for farmers through various interventions (such as MSPs, buffer stock management, and public distribution systems), private traders, including moneylenders, large merchants, and wealthy farmers, still control the majority of agricultural trade in India.  This private sector dominance often leads to challenges such as exploitation of farmers through unfair pricing practices.  The limited reach of government agencies and cooperatives means that a large proportion of farmers continue to rely on private traders for marketing their produce.  Therefore, both statements accurately depict the complex nature of agricultural marketing in India, highlighting both government initiatives and the persistent role of private trade.


**7.  With reference to employment in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The majority of workers in India are self-employed, with casual wage laborers and regular salaried employees together accounting for less than half the workforce.
2.  In recent years, employment growth in India has decelerated, and newly emerging jobs are predominantly found in the service sector.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the structure of India's workforce. A significant portion of the workforce is engaged in self-employment, indicating a prevalence of small-scale enterprises and informal employment. While regular salaried employment exists, its proportion is smaller compared to self-employment. Casual wage labor also constitutes a significant part of the workforce, highlighting the vulnerability of many workers to unpredictable income and lack of social security.  The dominance of self-employment is a key feature of the Indian labor market.

Statement 2 points to a concerning trend in India's employment landscape.  The rate of employment growth has slowed down in recent years, indicating a mismatch between economic growth and job creation.  This deceleration in employment growth is a major concern for policymakers and economists.  The newly created jobs are predominantly in the service sector, reflecting a shift in the economic structure but not necessarily creating enough jobs to absorb the growing workforce.  This shift towards the service sector, while contributing to economic growth, has not translated into commensurate job creation across all sectors of the economy.  Therefore, both statements correctly describe important aspects of the Indian employment scenario.


**1. With reference to the determinants of India's potential GDP, consider the following statements:**

1.  A high capital-output ratio can hinder significant output increases despite high savings.
2.  Weak administrative machinery can impede capital formation and efficient resource allocation, thus limiting potential GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A high capital-output ratio signifies that a large amount of capital investment is required to generate a unit of output.  This means that even with high savings and investment, the actual increase in output might be limited, hindering the realization of potential GDP.  This is because a significant portion of investment is not translating into productive capacity.  Factors contributing to a high capital-output ratio include technological inefficiencies, inadequate infrastructure, and skill gaps in the workforce.

Statement 2 is also correct.  A weak administrative machinery, characterized by bureaucratic inefficiencies, corruption, and lack of transparency, can significantly impede capital formation.  It creates an environment of uncertainty and discourages both domestic and foreign investment.  Furthermore, even if capital is formed, inefficient allocation of resources due to poor governance can prevent the economy from reaching its full potential.  This can manifest in projects being delayed, funds being misappropriated, and overall productivity suffering.  The inability to efficiently utilize resources directly translates to lower potential GDP.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect factors that constrain India's potential GDP.


**2. With reference to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), consider the following statements:**

1.  PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries.
2.  India's ranking as the world's sixth-largest economy is based solely on nominal GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach.  It aims to determine the relative value of currencies based on their purchasing power in each country. By comparing the prices of the same goods and services in different countries, a PPP exchange rate can be calculated, which reflects the true purchasing power of each currency.  This contrasts with nominal exchange rates, which are determined by market forces.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India's ranking as the world's sixth-largest economy is often cited, it's crucial to distinguish between nominal GDP and PPP-adjusted GDP.  Nominal GDP uses current exchange rates to convert GDP figures into a common currency, while PPP-adjusted GDP uses PPP exchange rates to account for differences in purchasing power.  India's ranking as the sixth-largest economy is frequently based on PPP-adjusted GDP, reflecting its larger size in terms of purchasing power, not solely on nominal GDP.  A country with a high nominal GDP might have a lower PPP-adjusted GDP if its currency is overvalued.


**3. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPI gives greater weight to food items compared to the WPI.
2.  The RBI currently uses the CPI as its primary measure of inflation for monetary policy decisions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CPI and WPI are both measures of inflation, but they differ in their composition and weighting. The CPI tracks the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of goods and services.  Food items typically constitute a significant portion of household expenditure for a large segment of the Indian population, thus receiving a higher weight in the CPI calculation compared to the WPI. The WPI, on the other hand, measures changes in prices at the wholesale level.  It includes a broader range of goods but gives less weight to consumer goods like food.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI has historically relied more on the WPI, it has increasingly shifted its focus towards the CPI as a more comprehensive and accurate measure of inflation impacting the average consumer.  The CPI is now considered a more relevant indicator of inflation's impact on household budgets. However, it is not entirely accurate to say that the CPI is *exclusively* used for monetary policy decisions; the RBI considers a range of indicators before making policy adjustments.


**4. With reference to market demand for a good, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the price of a substitute good will increase the demand for the good in question.
2. An increase in consumer income will always increase the demand for a normal good.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of one another. If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will likely switch to the relatively cheaper alternative, leading to an increase in the demand for the original good.  For example, if the price of coffee rises, the demand for tea (a substitute) might increase. This demonstrates the inverse relationship between the price of a substitute and the demand for the good in question.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While an increase in consumer income generally leads to an increase in demand for normal goods (goods for which demand increases with income), this is not always the case.  Inferior goods are those for which demand decreases as income rises.  For example, individuals might reduce their consumption of cheaper, low-quality food items as their income increases, opting for more expensive, higher-quality alternatives.  Therefore, the relationship between consumer income and demand is dependent on the nature of the good—normal or inferior.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy and exchange rates, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates a depreciation of the rupee.
2. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is an index that measures the overall value of a currency against a basket of other currencies. An increase in NEER indicates an appreciation of the domestic currency (in this case, the rupee), meaning it has become stronger relative to the other currencies in the basket.  A depreciation would be indicated by a *decrease* in NEER.

Statement 2 is correct. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) adjusts the NEER for inflation differentials between the domestic economy and its trading partners. An increase in REER suggests that the domestic currency has become more expensive relative to other currencies, taking inflation into account. This can make domestic exports less competitive and imports more attractive, potentially worsening the trade balance.  However, a *decrease* in REER would improve trade competitiveness by making domestic goods cheaper for foreign buyers.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the relationship between exchange rates and trade competitiveness.


**6. With reference to the Indian economy and government borrowings, consider the following statements:**

1.  A large component of India's internal debt consists of dated securities issued through auctions at market-related rates.
2.  The government's fiscal deficit is directly financed through borrowings from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A substantial portion of India's internal debt is comprised of dated securities. These are government bonds with a fixed maturity date and coupon rate, issued through auctions to investors at market-determined prices. This method ensures that the government borrows at rates reflecting prevailing market conditions.  The auction process promotes transparency and efficiency in government borrowing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the government does borrow to finance its fiscal deficit, it's inaccurate to say it's *directly* financed through borrowings from the RBI.  Excessive borrowing from the central bank can lead to inflationary pressures.  Therefore, the government primarily relies on market borrowings (issuing bonds and securities) and other sources of revenue to finance its fiscal deficit.  The RBI's role is primarily to manage monetary policy and maintain macroeconomic stability, not to directly finance the government's deficit in a continuous manner.  This distinction is crucial for maintaining the independence of the central bank.


**7. With reference to inflation-indexed bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. IIBs offer investors protection against inflation uncertainty.
2.  The interest income and capital gains from IIBs are tax-exempt in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Inflation-indexed bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation.  The principal and interest payments on these bonds are adjusted periodically based on an inflation index, ensuring that the real value of the investment is maintained.  This feature makes them attractive to risk-averse investors who seek to preserve the real value of their savings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While IIBs offer protection against inflation, the interest income and capital gains earned from them are generally subject to income tax in India.  Tax treatment might vary slightly depending on the specific terms and conditions of the IIBs, but they are not typically tax-exempt.  This is a crucial distinction because the tax implications can significantly affect the overall return on investment.


**8. With reference to the effects of a tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, consider the following statements:**

1.  A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve can lead to capital flight from emerging economies.
2.  Capital flight increases the cost of borrowing for Indian firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A tight monetary policy, typically involving raising interest rates, is often adopted by central banks to curb inflation. When the US Federal Reserve implements a tight monetary policy, it increases interest rates in the US. This makes US assets more attractive to investors seeking higher returns, leading to capital outflow from emerging markets like India. Investors might withdraw their investments from Indian markets and invest them in the US to take advantage of the higher interest rates, causing capital flight.

Statement 2 is also correct. Capital flight from emerging markets like India can lead to a higher cost of borrowing for Indian firms that have taken External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs). When there's capital flight, the demand for the US dollar (or other major currencies) increases relative to the Indian rupee. This leads to depreciation of the rupee, making it more expensive for Indian firms to repay their ECBs, which are typically denominated in foreign currencies. The increased demand for foreign currency also puts upward pressure on interest rates, increasing the overall cost of borrowing for firms with existing ECBs.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe the consequences of a tight US monetary policy on the Indian economy.


**9. With reference to convertible bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Convertible bonds typically offer a lower interest rate compared to non-convertible bonds due to the option to convert to equity.
2. The conversion option in convertible bonds provides bondholders with some degree of protection against rising inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Convertible bonds offer investors the option of converting the bond into equity shares of the issuing company after a certain period. Because of this added benefit, convertible bonds generally offer a lower interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds. The lower interest rate reflects the value of the conversion option.  Investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate in exchange for the potential upside from equity appreciation.

Statement 2 is also correct, although the protection against inflation is indirect. The conversion option provides a degree of inflation protection because, if inflation rises significantly, the value of the underlying equity shares (which the bond can be converted into) might also increase, potentially offsetting some of the inflation's impact.  This is not a direct or guaranteed inflation hedge like that offered by inflation-indexed bonds, but it provides an additional layer of protection against rising prices.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect characteristics of convertible bonds.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Command and Control" model of economic planning, prevalent in India from 1950 to 1990, prioritized market forces of demand and supply in determining production levels of major items like steel and cement.
2.  The "Plug and Play" model, as envisioned by the Prime Minister, emphasizes minimal government intervention and bureaucratic hurdles for private businesses, focusing instead on providing policy support and infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Command and Control" model, characteristic of India's pre-1991 socialist economy, was precisely *not* based on market forces.  The central government dictated production targets, capacity, and technology for key industries, overriding market demand and supply mechanisms.  This centralized approach was a defining feature of the era, leading to inefficiencies and shortages. The statement reverses the reality of the system.

Statement 2 is correct. The "Plug and Play" model represents a shift towards a more liberalized economic environment.  It envisions a streamlined process for private sector businesses, with the government providing the necessary infrastructure and policy support to minimize bureaucratic obstacles. The focus is on creating a conducive environment for private investment and growth, rather than direct government control.  This reflects a post-1991 LPG (Liberalization, Privatization, Globalization) reform approach.


**2. With reference to the 'Amrit Kaal' vision for India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 'Panch Pran' (five pledges) of Amrit Kaal prioritize economic growth above all else, emphasizing a solely market-driven approach to development.
2.  The Amrit Kaal, encompassing a 25-year period leading to India@100, includes a commitment to eradicating all forms of social inequality and promoting inclusive growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While economic development is certainly a key component of the Amrit Kaal vision, the 'Panch Pran' are not solely focused on economic growth.  They encompass a broader set of national goals, including social justice, cultural pride, national unity, and citizen duty.  The emphasis is on holistic and inclusive development, not a purely market-driven approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The Amrit Kaal vision explicitly aims to build a developed India, which inherently includes tackling social inequalities.  The pledges related to eradicating slavery (symbolic of exploitation) and promoting unity and solidarity directly address social issues. Inclusive growth, ensuring that the benefits of development reach all sections of society, is a central theme.


**3. With reference to inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Inclusive growth strategies primarily focus on direct income redistribution schemes to ensure equitable distribution of wealth.
2.  The Eleventh Five-Year Plan defined inclusive growth as a growth process that ensures equality of opportunity for all and yields broad-based benefits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While income redistribution might be a short-term measure to alleviate poverty, inclusive growth strategies prioritize long-term sustainable solutions. The focus is on creating productive employment opportunities and empowering marginalized groups to participate in and benefit from economic growth. Direct income redistribution is not the core strategy; it's more about ensuring that growth benefits everyone.

Statement 2 is correct. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan explicitly defined inclusive growth in terms of equitable development and broad-based benefits, emphasizing equality of opportunity. This definition highlights the importance of both economic growth and social justice in achieving inclusive development.  This aligns with the broader understanding of inclusive growth as going beyond mere GDP growth.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in per capita real GNP automatically translates to a higher level of economic development if poverty and unemployment remain unchanged.
2.  High savings in an economy always result in a significant increase in output, regardless of other factors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While an increase in per capita real GNP indicates increased average income, it doesn't automatically equate to higher economic development.  Economic development is a broader concept encompassing factors like human development, infrastructure, social justice, and environmental sustainability.  High GNP with persistent poverty and unemployment suggests an unequal distribution of wealth and a lack of overall societal progress.  The statement ignores crucial aspects of development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. High savings are a necessary but not sufficient condition for increased output. The efficiency of capital utilization, technological progress, and the overall investment climate play crucial roles.  A high capital-output ratio (meaning more investment is needed to generate a unit of output) can negate the positive impact of high savings.  Other factors like administrative efficiency and human capital also matter.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates are calculated by comparing prices of a similar basket of goods and services across different countries, adjusted for differences in purchasing power.
2.  India's ranking as the world's sixth-largest economy is consistently higher when measured using PPP dollars compared to nominal GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries.  The aim is to adjust for differences in the purchasing power of currencies, providing a more accurate comparison of economic output across nations with varying price levels.  This is a standard method used in international economics.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's ranking among the world's largest economies is generally higher when using PPP exchange rates than when using nominal exchange rates. This is because PPP adjusts for the lower cost of goods and services in India, making its GDP appear larger in terms of purchasing power.  This is a significant consideration for understanding India's economic size relative to other nations.


**6. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPI gives more weight to services compared to the WPI, which primarily focuses on the prices of goods.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) primarily uses the WPI as its key measure of inflation for monetary policy decisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CPI (Consumer Price Index) reflects the price changes of a basket of goods and services consumed by households, giving significant weight to services. The WPI (Wholesale Price Index) focuses on the prices of goods at the wholesale level, with a relatively lower weight on services.  This difference in scope and weighting is important for understanding the different uses of these indices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI has shifted its primary focus towards the CPI as its key measure of inflation for monetary policy decisions, rather than the WPI. The CPI is considered a better reflection of the impact of price changes on consumers and overall inflation in the economy. The WPI is still used, but the CPI holds greater significance for monetary policy.


**7. With reference to market demand for a good, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the price of a substitute good will lead to a decrease in the market demand for the original good.
2.  An increase in the price of a complementary good will lead to an increase in the market demand for the original good.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of each other. If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper original good, leading to an increase (not a decrease as stated) in its market demand. This is a fundamental principle of consumer behavior.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Complementary goods are those that are consumed together.  If the price of a complementary good increases, the demand for the original good will *decrease* because consumers will reduce their consumption of both goods due to the higher overall cost. The statement misrepresents the relationship between complementary goods and demand.


**8. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates a depreciation of the rupee.
2.  An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  NEER (Nominal Effective Exchange Rate) measures the value of a currency against a weighted average of other currencies. An increase in NEER indicates that the rupee has become *more expensive* relative to other currencies, meaning a depreciation (not appreciation as stated) of the rupee.

Statement 2 is incorrect. REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate) adjusts the NEER for inflation differences between countries. An increase in REER suggests that the rupee has become *more expensive* relative to other currencies, considering inflation; this indicates a decrease (not improvement) in trade competitiveness as exports become more expensive and imports cheaper. The statement misinterprets the impact of REER on trade competitiveness.


**9. With reference to the functions of money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money acts as a store of value, but its value is always stable over time due to its inherent characteristics.
2.  Money acts as a medium of exchange, eliminating the need for a double coincidence of wants in transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While money does act as a store of value, its value is not always stable. Inflation can erode the purchasing power of money over time.  The statement ignores the impact of inflation on the value of money.

Statement 2 is correct. Money's primary function is as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions by eliminating the need for a double coincidence of wants (where both parties in a barter transaction must desire what the other has).  This is a fundamental role of money in any modern economy.


**10. With reference to seigniorage, consider the following statements:**

1. Seigniorage is the profit a central bank makes from issuing currency, primarily from the difference between the face value of the currency and the cost of production.
2.  Inflation tax, a component of seigniorage, refers to the loss of value experienced by individuals holding cash due to inflation, thereby reducing the central bank's liability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Seigniorage is indeed the profit earned by a central bank from issuing currency. It's the difference between the face value of the currency and the cost of printing and distributing it. This is a significant source of revenue for many central banks.

Statement 2 is correct. Inflation tax is a component of seigniorage.  When inflation occurs, the real value of cash held by individuals declines, reducing the central bank's liability (the amount it owes to the public in terms of currency). This reduction in liability contributes to the central bank's profit, though it comes at the expense of the purchasing power of the public.


**11. With reference to the International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  IFSCs, such as GIFT City, are treated as domestic territory for tax and regulatory purposes.
2.  Investments in IFSC entities by Indian residents are treated as Overseas Direct Investments (ODIs) under RBI regulations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IFSCs are specifically designed to be treated as *outside* India for certain regulatory and tax purposes.  This allows them to operate under a different regulatory framework and attract international business. They are not treated as domestic territory for all purposes.

Statement 2 is correct.  Investments in IFSC entities by Indian residents are indeed considered ODIs (Overseas Direct Investments) under RBI regulations. This is because IFSCs are treated as outside India for the purposes of such regulations. This classification is important for compliance and reporting requirements.


**12. With reference to Strategic Disinvestment of Public Sector Units (PSUs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Strategic disinvestment involves the sale of a substantial portion of government shareholding in a PSU, without necessarily transferring management control.
2.  The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) is the nodal department for strategic disinvestment, working independently of NITI Aayog.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Strategic disinvestment, by definition, involves not only the sale of a substantial portion of government shareholding but also the transfer of management control to a strategic partner. This transfer of control is a key element distinguishing it from simple disinvestment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. DIPAM is the nodal department for strategic disinvestment, but it works *in coordination* with NITI Aayog, not independently.  NITI Aayog plays a role in identifying PSUs suitable for strategic disinvestment,  while DIPAM manages the process of disinvestment.


**13. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The current account of the BoP includes transactions that directly affect a country's foreign assets and liabilities.
2.  The capital account of the BoP includes transactions related to visible and invisible trade, unilateral transfers, and investment income.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The capital account of the BoP, not the current account, records transactions that directly affect a country's foreign assets and liabilities. These include foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and loans. The current account focuses on transactions related to trade and income flows.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The current account, not the capital account, includes transactions related to visible and invisible trade, unilateral transfers, and investment income.  The capital account deals with capital flows that affect a country's assets and liabilities. The statement confuses the components of the current and capital accounts.


**14. With reference to Bitcoins, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bitcoin transactions are anonymous, meaning neither party needs to reveal their identity to the other.
2.  Central banks of countries directly track and regulate all Bitcoin transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, meaning they are linked to Bitcoin addresses rather than directly identifiable individuals. While not entirely anonymous, the level of anonymity is significantly higher than traditional financial transactions.  This is a key feature of Bitcoin’s decentralized nature.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Central banks do not directly track and regulate Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized blockchain technology, making it independent of central bank control.  While governments are increasingly regulating the use of Bitcoin, they lack direct control over transactions on the blockchain.


**15. With reference to Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The scheme primarily aims to provide loans to poor farmers for specific crop cultivation.
2.  The scheme's objective is to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) focuses on providing funding to *non-farm* small and micro enterprises, not primarily to farmers.  It aims to support entrepreneurship and job creation in the non-agricultural sector.

Statement 2 is correct. A key objective of MUDRA Yojana is to bring small businesses into the formal financial system, providing them with access to credit and other financial services.  This helps to formalize the informal economy and promote business growth.


**16. With reference to the Government's Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  These schemes aim to reduce India's dependence on gold imports and increase domestic gold reserves.
2.  A major objective is to promote Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewellery sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are designed to mobilize idle gold held by households, reducing the need for gold imports and bolstering domestic gold reserves.  This helps to improve the country's balance of payments and reduce its vulnerability to international gold price fluctuations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  These schemes are not primarily aimed at promoting FDI in the gold and jewellery sector.  Their focus is on domestic gold mobilization and management, not attracting foreign investment.  The schemes are designed to address India's specific gold-related challenges.


**17. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  NPCI's primary role is to promote digital payments and financial inclusion through initiatives like RuPay.
2.  The NPCI is primarily involved in providing loans and credit facilities to small businesses and farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) plays a crucial role in promoting digital payments and financial inclusion.  Its initiatives, such as RuPay, aim to expand access to financial services, particularly in rural areas.  This supports the government's financial inclusion agenda.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NPCI is not directly involved in providing loans and credit facilities. It's a payment system operator, facilitating transactions between banks and other financial institutions.  The statement wrongly attributes lending functions to the NPCI.


**18. With reference to Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SFBs are primarily focused on providing credit to large corporations and multinational companies.
2.  One of the objectives of establishing SFBs is to encourage entrepreneurship, particularly in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  SFBs (Small Finance Banks) are specifically designed to cater to the financial needs of small businesses, small and marginal farmers, and low-income individuals. They are not focused on large corporations or MNCs.  The statement misrepresents the target clientele of SFBs.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key objective of establishing SFBs is to encourage entrepreneurship and financial inclusion, particularly in underserved rural areas.  By providing access to credit and financial services, SFBs aim to support the growth of small businesses and promote economic development in rural areas.


**19. With reference to "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1.  MDR is an incentive given by the government to merchants for promoting digital payments.
2.  MDR is a charge levied by banks on merchants for accepting payments through debit cards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MDR (Merchant Discount Rate) is not an incentive from the government but a *fee* charged by banks to merchants for processing debit and credit card payments.  The government might offer incentives to promote digital payments, but MDR itself is a cost for merchants.

Statement 2 is correct.  MDR is the fee that banks charge merchants for processing card payments.  This fee covers the cost of processing the transaction and is a crucial aspect of the digital payments ecosystem.  The statement correctly defines MDR.


**20. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Legal tender money includes all forms of bank money, such as cheques and drafts.
2.  Legal tender money refers to currency that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of debts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Legal tender money refers to currency issued by the government (coins and banknotes), which a creditor is legally required to accept for payment.  Cheques and drafts are not legal tender; they are instruments of payment but not legal tender.

Statement 2 is correct. Legal tender money is defined by its legal enforceability.  A creditor must accept legal tender currency in settlement of a debt. This is a key characteristic of legal tender, distinguishing it from other forms of payment.


**21. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) manages and services only Government of India Securities, not State Government Securities.
2.  Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued at a discount from their face value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a major role in managing Government of India securities, it also manages some State Government securities.  The statement oversimplifies the RBI's role in debt management.

Statement 2 is correct. Treasury bills are indeed short-term debt instruments issued at a discount.  They mature at their face value, with the difference between the purchase price and face value representing the interest earned.  This is a standard feature of treasury bills globally.


**22. With reference to Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), consider the following statements:**

1.  CAR is the amount that banks must maintain as their own funds to cover potential losses from non-repayment of loans.
2.  Individual banks determine their own CAR based on internal risk assessments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  CAR (Capital Adequacy Ratio) is a regulatory requirement, not a bank's internal decision. Banks must maintain a minimum level of capital (as a percentage of their risk-weighted assets) to absorb potential losses from loan defaults and other risks. This is a crucial aspect of banking regulation to maintain financial stability.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  CAR is *not* determined by individual banks but is set by regulatory authorities (like the RBI in India) based on international standards (like Basel norms).  While banks' internal risk assessments inform their capital planning, the minimum CAR is externally mandated.


**23. Which of the following is not typically included among the assets of a commercial bank in India?**

(a) Advances (Loans)
(b) Deposits (Customer deposits)
(c) Investments (Government securities)
(d) Money at call and short notice (Interbank loans)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Advances (loans), investments (government securities, etc.), and money at call and short notice (interbank lending) are all considered assets of a commercial bank.  Deposits, however, are *liabilities* of the bank, representing the money the bank owes to its depositors.  The statement correctly identifies deposits as liabilities.


**24. With reference to reducing the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following factors:**

1.  Foreign currency earnings from India's IT sector contribute significantly to forex reserves, strengthening the currency.
2.  Increasing government expenditure strengthens the rupee by boosting demand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Foreign currency earnings from India's IT sector are a significant source of foreign exchange reserves, improving the country's ability to defend its currency against external shocks and reducing the risk of a currency crisis. This strengthens the balance of payments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Increasing government expenditure can, in fact, *weaken* the currency if it leads to higher inflation or a larger current account deficit.  It increases money supply and can put pressure on the currency's value.  The statement misrepresents the impact of government expenditure.


**25. Which of the following measures is least likely to be used by the Government/RBI to stop the slide of the Indian rupee?**

(a) Curbing imports of non-essential goods and promoting exports
(b) Encouraging Indian borrowers to issue rupee-denominated Masala Bonds
(c) Easing conditions relating to external commercial borrowing
(d) Following a contractionary monetary policy (reducing money supply)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Easing conditions relating to external commercial borrowing would likely *increase* the demand for foreign currency, putting further downward pressure on the rupee. The other options —curbing imports, promoting exports, and following a contractionary monetary policy—are all measures that the government and RBI might use to strengthen the rupee.  The statement correctly identifies the least effective measure.


**26. The money multiplier in an economy is most likely to increase with which of the following?**

(a) An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR)
(b) An increase in the banking habit of the population
(c) An increase in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR)
(d) An increase in the population of the country

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

An increase in the banking habit of the population means more people deposit their money in banks.  This increases the money banks have available to lend, leading to a larger money multiplier effect. CRR and SLR are reserve requirements that *reduce* the money multiplier. Population growth alone does not directly impact the money multiplier. The statement correctly identifies the factor that increases the money multiplier.


**27. If another global financial crisis occurs, which of the following actions would most likely provide immunity to India?**

1.  Not depending on short-term foreign borrowings
2.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility

Select the correct answer using the code given below:
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Not depending on short-term foreign borrowings would reduce India's vulnerability to sudden capital flight during a global crisis.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility, while potentially beneficial in normal times, could make India more susceptible to speculative attacks and capital flight during a crisis. The statement correctly prioritizes reducing reliance on short-term debt.


**28. If you withdraw Rs. 1,00,000 in cash from your demand deposit account, what is the immediate effect on the aggregate money supply?**

(a) It reduces the money supply by Rs. 1,00,000
(b) It increases the money supply by Rs. 1,00,000
(c) It increases the money supply by more than Rs. 1,00,000
(d) It leaves the money supply unchanged

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The immediate effect of withdrawing Rs. 1,00,000 in cash is a reduction in the money supply by that amount.  The money is simply transferred from a deposit account (M1 money) to cash (M0 money), with no net change in aggregate money supply.  The statement correctly describes the immediate impact.


**29. Under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, short-term credit support is given for which of the following?**

1.  Working capital for farm operations
2.  Purchase of large farm machinery like tractors
3.  Consumption needs of farm households
4.  Post-harvest expenses

Select the correct answer using the code given below:
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

KCC primarily provides short-term credit for working capital (inputs, seeds, fertilizers), consumption needs (household expenses), and post-harvest expenses.  Large machinery purchases are typically financed through long-term loans, not the KCC scheme. The statement correctly identifies the uses of KCC credit.


**30. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations.
2.  Call money is a short-term interbank borrowing instrument.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by large and creditworthy corporations to raise short-term funds. This is a common form of corporate financing.

Statement 2 is correct. Call money is a short-term borrowing instrument used primarily in interbank transactions for managing liquidity. It's a very short-term loan between banks.  The statement correctly defines call money.


**31. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, which of the following is a major characteristic?**

(a) It primarily involves investment in government securities.
(b) It is characterized by significant debt-servicing obligations.
(c) It typically involves a long-term commitment and control by the foreign investor.
(d) It is largely a debt-creating capital flow.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

FDI is characterized by a long-term commitment and control by the foreign investor.  It's not primarily investment in government securities, nor is it significantly debt-creating.  The statement correctly identifies FDI as equity investment with control.


**32. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is appointed by the President of India on the advice of the Central Government.
2.  The RBI Act grants the RBI autonomy in its operations, but the Central Government can issue directions in public interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the President of India, but the process involves consultation and advice from the central government.  This reflects the government's oversight role.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI Act grants the RBI significant autonomy, but it also allows the Central Government to issue directions in the public interest. This balance between autonomy and government oversight is a key feature of the RBI's governance structure.


**33. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  They are supervised and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  They are allowed to issue equity shares and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. UCBs are now supervised and regulated by the RBI, following amendments to the Banking Regulation Act. This oversight is aimed at enhancing their financial stability and protecting depositors.

Statement 2 is correct. UCBs are allowed to issue both equity shares and preference shares to raise capital.  This is a common feature of cooperative banks' capital structure.


**34. Indian Government Bond Yields are influenced by which of the following?**

1. Actions of the United States Federal Reserve
2.  Inflation and short-term interest rates
3. Actions of the Reserve Bank of India

Select the correct answer using the code given below.
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three factors influence Indian Government Bond Yields. Actions of the US Federal Reserve impact global interest rates, indirectly affecting Indian bond yields. Domestic inflation and short-term interest rates directly affect bond yields.  The RBI's monetary policy actions also significantly influence bond yields. The statement correctly identifies all three influencing factors.


**35. Which of the following can be included in Foreign Direct Investments (FDI)?**

1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds
2.  Global depository receipts
3.  Non-resident external deposits

Select the correct answer using the code given below:
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Global depository receipts (GDRs) represent FDI as they involve the issuance of shares of a company listed on a foreign stock exchange.  Foreign currency convertible bonds and non-resident external deposits are not considered FDI as they do not represent equity investment or direct control.  The statement correctly identifies only GDRs as FDI.


**36. The effect of devaluation of a currency is that it necessarily:**

1. Improves the competitiveness of domestic exports in foreign markets.
2. Increases the foreign value of domestic currency.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper in foreign markets,

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.  I've aimed for a challenging level by incorporating subtle inaccuracies and plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in absolute real GNP, even with a stagnant per capita real GNP, signifies robust economic development if accompanied by a substantial reduction in poverty and unemployment.
2.  A rise in per capita real GNP, coupled with increased industrial output surpassing agricultural output, unequivocally indicates enhanced economic development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While a reduction in poverty and unemployment is a positive indicator of development, an increase in *absolute* real GNP without a corresponding rise in *per capita* real GNP suggests that the overall economic growth is not benefiting the population proportionally.  The population increase may have outpaced the economic growth, leading to a diluted per capita benefit. Economic development needs to improve the living standards of the population, and this requires a significant increase in per capita income.  Therefore, merely focusing on absolute real GNP is insufficient to evaluate economic development.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While increased industrial output surpassing agricultural output can contribute to economic development, it is not a sufficient condition.  Economic development is a multifaceted process encompassing various social, economic, and environmental factors.  A focus solely on industrial output ignores factors like income distribution, environmental sustainability, and human development indicators.  Moreover, a rise in per capita real GNP does not automatically translate into development if it's accompanied by rising inequality or environmental degradation.  A holistic assessment including a broad range of indicators is crucial.


**2. With reference to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and India's economic standing, consider the following statements:**

1.  PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of a standardized basket of goods and services across different countries, adjusting for differences in cost of living.
2. India's ranking as the world's sixth-largest economy, when measured in PPP dollars, is primarily determined by its large population and relatively low cost of living, which significantly inflates its PPP-adjusted GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries. This methodology accounts for variations in purchasing power across nations, providing a more accurate comparison of economic output than nominal exchange rates. The use of a standardized basket ensures comparability and minimizes distortions due to price differences.

Statement 2 is also correct. While India's large population and low cost of living contribute to its high PPP-adjusted GDP, it's not the *sole* factor.  Its large and growing economy also plays a significant role in boosting its PPP-adjusted GDP.  However, the statement accurately highlights the influence of relative purchasing power on the PPP calculation.  The relatively low cost of many goods and services in India, compared to developed nations, inflates its GDP when converted to PPP terms.  This is because the same amount of money buys more in India than it would in a high-cost country.


**3. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPI gives greater weight to services than the WPI, which primarily focuses on the price changes of goods at the wholesale level.
2. The RBI's shift to using the WPI as the primary measure of inflation for monetary policy decisions reflects a policy shift towards prioritizing wholesale price stability over consumer price stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CPI and WPI differ significantly in their coverage and weighting of various components. The CPI, which tracks changes in the price of a basket of goods and services consumed by households, typically gives a higher weight to services than the WPI.  The WPI, which measures price changes at the wholesale level, focuses primarily on goods.  This difference in weighting reflects the different aspects of the economy each index aims to capture.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The RBI's use of WPI as a supplementary inflation measure is not a complete shift away from CPI. While the WPI provides insights into producer price pressures and input costs, the RBI continues to use the CPI as its primary gauge of consumer inflation.  The RBI does not exclusively prioritize wholesale price stability over consumer price stability; rather, it considers both indicators alongside several other factors when making monetary policy decisions. The shift is more about using multiple indicators for a more comprehensive view of the inflation situation.


**4. With reference to market demand and factors influencing it, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the price of a substitute good will decrease the demand for the good in question, holding other factors constant.
2.  If a good is an inferior good and consumer income increases, then the demand for that good will increase, holding other factors constant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in the price of a *substitute* good will actually *increase* the demand for the original good.  Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of each other. If the price of the substitute rises, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper original good, thus increasing its demand.

Statement 2 is correct. Inferior goods are those for which demand decreases as consumer income rises.  Conversely, if consumer income increases, the demand for an inferior good will decrease, holding other factors constant.  This is because consumers tend to upgrade to superior goods as their income grows.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy and exchange rate indices, consider the following statements:**

1. A decrease in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates a depreciation of the Rupee against a basket of other currencies.
2.  An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) always signifies a deterioration in India's trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NEER is an index that tracks the value of the Rupee against a weighted average of other major currencies. A decrease in the NEER signifies that the Rupee has depreciated relative to this basket of currencies, meaning it takes more Rupees to buy one unit of foreign currency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While an increase in the REER generally indicates a loss of trade competitiveness (as Indian goods become relatively more expensive compared to foreign goods), it's not an absolute rule. Other factors like changes in productivity, global demand, and government policies can influence a country's trade competitiveness independently of the REER.  Therefore, an increase in REER doesn't automatically guarantee a deterioration in trade competitiveness.  It's one factor among many to consider.


**6. With reference to India’s external debt, consider the following statements:**

1. The majority of India’s external debt is held by private sector entities, reflecting the increasing role of private sector borrowing in financing India's development.
2.  All of India's external debt is denominated in US dollars, making India vulnerable to fluctuations in the dollar's value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While private sector borrowing has increased, a significant portion of India's external debt is still held by governmental entities.  The composition of India's external debt involves both government and private entities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a significant portion of India's external debt may be denominated in US dollars, it is not exclusively in US dollars.  India borrows in various currencies, including other major global currencies, to diversify its debt and reduce its exposure to any single currency's fluctuations.  This diversification strategy mitigates the risks associated with relying solely on the US dollar.


**7. With reference to the characteristics of  "Gold Tranche" (Reserve Tranche), consider the following statements:**

1. The "Gold Tranche" is a loan system operated by the World Bank, providing concessional loans to member countries facing balance-of-payments difficulties.
2.  It is a credit system granted by the IMF to its member countries, allowing them to draw upon their quota subscriptions for balance-of-payments support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The "Gold Tranche" is not associated with the World Bank's loan system.  The World Bank provides loans for development projects, not specifically for balance-of-payments issues.

Statement 2 is correct. The "Gold Tranche" is indeed a credit facility within the IMF's system, representing a portion of a member country's quota subscription that can be accessed without any specific conditions.  It's essentially a readily available credit line designed to provide immediate liquidity support to member countries facing temporary balance-of-payments difficulties.


**8. With reference to Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs), consider the following statements:**

1. TRIMs primarily focus on regulating foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into a country to ensure they align with national development objectives and protect domestic industries.
2.  TRIMs explicitly prohibit quantitative restrictions on imports by foreign investors, ensuring free and open access to foreign markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While TRIMs do relate to investment measures affecting trade, their primary focus is not on regulating FDI flows in general.  Instead, TRIMs target specific investment measures that distort or restrict trade.  The focus is on trade-distorting practices, not overall FDI regulation.

Statement 2 is correct. TRIMs explicitly prohibit certain trade-restrictive investment measures, including quantitative restrictions on imports by foreign investors.  This prohibition aims to create a more level playing field for both domestic and foreign firms engaged in international trade.


**9. With reference to the "G20 Common Framework," consider the following statements:**

1.  The G20 Common Framework is an initiative endorsed solely by the G20 nations, excluding any involvement from the Paris Club.
2. The primary objective of the G20 Common Framework is to provide debt relief and restructuring support to low-income countries facing unsustainable debt burdens.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the G20 endorses the Common Framework, the Paris Club, representing major creditor nations, is also involved in its implementation. The framework requires collaborative action from both the G20 and the Paris Club to achieve its objectives effectively.

Statement 2 is correct. The G20 Common Framework is specifically designed to provide a coordinated and comprehensive approach to debt restructuring for low-income countries struggling with unsustainable debt levels.  The aim is to help these countries regain fiscal sustainability and resume their development trajectories.


**10. With reference to the potential impacts of a global financial crisis on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Reducing reliance on short-term foreign borrowings would significantly reduce India's vulnerability to external shocks during a global financial crisis.
2. Maintaining full capital account convertibility could exacerbate the impact of a global financial crisis by increasing the volatility of capital flows in and out of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Short-term foreign borrowings are particularly susceptible to sudden reversals during global financial crises.  Reducing reliance on such borrowings would strengthen India's resilience to capital flight and liquidity pressures during times of global economic instability.

Statement 2 is also correct. Full capital account convertibility, while offering benefits in normal times, could magnify the negative consequences of a global financial crisis.  Increased capital mobility could lead to rapid inflows and outflows, making the Indian economy more vulnerable to destabilizing speculative attacks and sudden changes in market sentiment.  The volatility of capital flows under full convertibility could amplify the shocks experienced during a global crisis.




**1. With reference to Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  It primarily focuses on providing collateral-free loans to micro-entrepreneurs.
2.  The scheme aims to increase credit flow to the agricultural sector by offering subsidized loans to farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a scheme launched by the Indian government to provide funding to micro and small enterprises (MSEs).  Statement 1 accurately reflects a core aspect of the scheme: its emphasis on providing collateral-free loans to micro-entrepreneurs, promoting financial inclusion and boosting entrepreneurship among the less privileged. This aligns with the scheme's objective of bringing small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system, facilitating their access to credit without the need for traditional collateral.

Statement 2, however, is incorrect. While PMMY indirectly supports the agricultural sector by funding businesses that supply agricultural inputs or services, its primary focus is not on direct credit to farmers.  Other government schemes are specifically designed for agricultural credit. The PMMY's target audience is primarily micro-entrepreneurs across various sectors, including but not limited to agriculture-related activities.  Confusing PMMY's indirect support for the agricultural sector with its direct aim creates a plausible distractor.  The key difference lies in the *primary* beneficiary group: micro-entrepreneurs versus farmers.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Bitcoin:**

1.  Bitcoin transactions are anonymous and untraceable by any authority.
2.  Bitcoins are regulated and issued by central banks worldwide.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is false because while Bitcoin transactions offer a degree of pseudononymity (using Bitcoin addresses instead of names), they are not entirely anonymous. Blockchain technology records all transactions publicly, making it possible to trace the flow of Bitcoins, although identifying the real-world individuals behind the addresses can be challenging.  Law enforcement agencies have increasingly developed techniques to track Bitcoin transactions, particularly in cases of illicit activities. This fact serves as a crucial distractor, as the perception of complete anonymity is a common misconception surrounding Bitcoin.

Statement 2 is also false. Bitcoins are decentralized digital currencies; they are not issued or regulated by any central bank or government. The Bitcoin network operates independently of any central authority.  This decentralized nature is a defining characteristic of Bitcoin, differentiating it from traditional fiat currencies. The option suggesting that central banks regulate Bitcoin is a significant distractor, playing on the familiarity of central bank roles in managing traditional currencies.


**3. With reference to the Government's Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  These schemes aim to reduce India's dependence on gold imports by mobilizing domestic gold reserves.
2.  A primary objective is to encourage Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are government initiatives designed to bring idle gold held by households into the formal financial system. This reduces the demand for imported gold, lessening India's reliance on gold imports and bolstering the country's foreign exchange reserves.  The schemes offer an alternative to physical gold ownership, encouraging investment in government bonds and other financial instruments.  The focus on reducing import dependence is a key policy goal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. These schemes are not primarily aimed at attracting FDI in the gold and jewelry sector.  While increased domestic gold availability might indirectly benefit the sector, the schemes' main purpose is to manage domestic gold reserves and reduce import dependency, not to directly stimulate foreign investment.  The inclusion of FDI as an objective is a significant distractor, potentially confusing the focus of the schemes.  The distinction between domestic gold mobilization and foreign investment attraction is critical.


**4. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  NPCI's primary function is to regulate and oversee all digital payment systems in India.
2.  RuPay, a domestic card payment network, was launched under the aegis of NPCI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NPCI facilitates digital payments in India but does not regulate or oversee all such systems.  The regulation of digital payment systems falls under the purview of various regulatory bodies like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). NPCI operates as a payment infrastructure provider, developing and operating systems like IMPS, UPI, and others, but not as an overarching regulatory body.  Attributing regulatory powers to NPCI is a key distractor, playing on its significant role in the digital payment ecosystem.

Statement 2 is correct. RuPay, a domestic card payment network, was indeed launched by NPCI.  This initiative aimed to provide an alternative to international card networks, promoting financial inclusion and reducing India's reliance on foreign payment systems.  This fact is relatively well-known, but its inclusion alongside the incorrect statement about NPCI's regulatory function creates a challenging MCQ.


**5. With reference to Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SFBs are primarily focused on providing financial services to marginalized farmers and rural populations.
2.  SFBs are prohibited from offering services like credit cards and internet banking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  SFBs in India are designed to cater to the financial needs of underserved segments of the population, with a significant focus on rural areas and marginalized communities, including farmers.  However, it's important to note that SFBs also serve other customer segments, not solely farmers. The emphasis on the underserved rural population and the inclusion of farmers as a significant target audience is the core aspect that makes this statement largely true.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  SFBs are permitted to offer a range of financial services, including credit cards and internet banking, provided they comply with all the regulatory guidelines.  Restricting SFBs from offering these services is a significant misconception.  This statement acts as a strong distractor, aiming to confuse candidates with potentially outdated information or a misunderstanding of SFB capabilities.  The focus is on the range of services permitted, contrasting the limited scope suggested by statement 2.


**6. With reference to the term "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1.  MDR refers to the incentive provided to a merchant by the government for accepting digital payments.
2.  MDR is a charge levied on a merchant by a bank for accepting payments through its debit cards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  MDR is not an incentive provided by the government; rather, it is a fee. While the government may incentivize *digital payments* through other schemes, MDR is a transaction cost borne by the merchant.  This distinction is crucial and serves as a strong distractor, blurring the lines between government incentives and merchant transaction fees.

Statement 2 is correct. MDR is a fee charged by banks to merchants for processing payments made through debit or credit cards.  This fee covers the costs associated with the transaction processing.  The statement clearly defines MDR as a charge levied by banks, directly addressing the core meaning of the term.


**7. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Legal tender money refers exclusively to metallic coins in circulation.
2.  A creditor is legally obligated to accept legal tender money in settlement of debts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Legal tender money includes not only metallic coins but also banknotes issued by the central bank.  Restricting legal tender to only metallic coins is a misconception, creating a plausible distractor.  The broader definition encompasses both coins and banknotes.

Statement 2 is correct.  Legal tender money is that which a creditor is legally compelled to accept in repayment of a debt. This is the defining characteristic of legal tender, ensuring that it serves as a universally acceptable medium of exchange for settling financial obligations.  This statement directly addresses the core legal definition of legal tender.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1.  RBI manages and services only Government of India securities, not State Government securities.
2.  Treasury bills are exclusively issued by the Government of India; State Governments do not issue them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While RBI plays a significant role in managing and servicing Government of India securities, it also deals with some State Government securities.  The statement's limitation to only Government of India securities is a key distractor, playing on the more prominent role of RBI in managing central government debt.

Statement 2 is correct.  Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued primarily by the central government to meet its short-term borrowing needs. State Governments typically utilize different instruments for their short-term borrowing.  This statement accurately reflects the issuer of treasury bills.


**9. With reference to the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), consider the following statements:**

1.  CAR is the amount banks must maintain as their own funds to cover potential losses from non-repayment of loans.
2.  Each individual bank decides its own CAR based on its risk assessment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  CAR is a regulatory requirement that mandates banks to hold a minimum percentage of their risk-weighted assets as capital. This capital acts as a buffer to absorb potential losses arising from loan defaults or other financial setbacks. The statement accurately describes the purpose of CAR as a capital cushion against losses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CAR is not determined by individual banks but is set by regulatory authorities like the RBI.  While banks' risk profiles influence their capital requirements, the minimum CAR is a regulatory mandate, not a bank-specific decision.  The statement gives the impression that banks have autonomy in deciding CAR, which is a misconception and a strong distractor, highlighting the regulatory nature of CAR.


**10. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deposits held by customers are considered an asset of the bank.
2.  Advances (loans) given by the bank are considered liabilities of the bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Deposits are liabilities for a bank, not assets.  They represent the bank's obligations to its depositors.  The statement misrepresents the nature of deposits, creating a common misconception and a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  Advances (loans) are assets for a bank. They represent the bank's claims on borrowers.  This statement accurately reflects the classification of loans on a bank's balance sheet.  The contrast between the incorrect classification of deposits and the correct classification of loans enhances the question's difficulty.


**11.  Consider the following statements regarding factors contributing to reducing the risk of a currency crisis in India:**

1.  Increased government expenditure significantly reduces currency crisis risk.
2.  Remittances from Indians abroad strengthen the country's foreign exchange reserves, thereby mitigating currency crisis risk.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Increased government expenditure, especially if not financed prudently, can actually *increase* the risk of a currency crisis.  Excessive government spending can lead to higher inflation and a widening current account deficit, weakening the currency.  This statement presents a counterintuitive argument, creating a strong distractor for candidates who may not fully grasp the macroeconomic implications of government spending.

Statement 2 is correct.  Remittances from Indians abroad constitute a significant inflow of foreign exchange, bolstering the country's foreign exchange reserves and enhancing its ability to defend its currency against external shocks.  This statement accurately reflects the positive impact of remittances on currency stability.


**12. With reference to measures taken by the Government/RBI to stop the slide of the Indian rupee, consider the following statements:**

1.  Easing conditions relating to external commercial borrowing (ECB) helps stabilize the rupee.
2.  Following an expansionary monetary policy strengthens the rupee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Easing ECB norms can actually *exacerbate* the rupee's decline. Increased inflows of foreign currency through ECBs can lead to inflation and a widening current account deficit, putting downward pressure on the rupee.  This statement presents a counterintuitive argument, serving as a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy, characterized by lower interest rates, typically weakens a currency. Lower interest rates make the currency less attractive to foreign investors, leading to capital outflows and currency depreciation.  This statement presents another counterintuitive argument, creating a further challenge for candidates.


**13. With reference to the money multiplier in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) increases the money multiplier.
2.  An increase in the banking habit of the population increases the money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  An increase in CRR *decreases* the money multiplier.  A higher CRR means banks have to keep a larger proportion of their deposits with the central bank, reducing the amount available for lending and thus decreasing the money multiplier effect.  The statement presents the opposite relationship, acting as a strong distractor, testing candidates' understanding of monetary policy tools.

Statement 2 is correct.  A higher banking habit (more people depositing money in banks) increases the money multiplier.  More deposits mean more funds available for banks to lend, leading to a larger money multiplier effect.  This statement accurately reflects the relationship between banking habits and the money multiplier.


**14. Consider the following statements about actions/policies that could give India immunity to another global financial crisis:**

1.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility provides significant immunity.
2.  Not depending on short-term foreign borrowings reduces vulnerability to crises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While capital account convertibility offers certain benefits, full convertibility can also increase vulnerability to global financial shocks.  Sudden capital flight during a crisis can severely impact a country's currency and financial stability.  The statement presents a simplified view of capital account convertibility's impact, creating a plausible distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  Relying heavily on short-term foreign borrowings makes a country highly susceptible to global financial crises.  Sudden changes in global interest rates or investor sentiment can lead to difficulties in rolling over these debts, triggering a financial crisis.  This statement accurately highlights the risk associated with short-term foreign debt.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the immediate effect of withdrawing Rs. 1,00,000 in cash from a demand deposit account:**

1.  The aggregate money supply in the economy immediately increases by more than Rs. 1,00,000.
2.  The aggregate money supply in the economy immediately decreases by Rs. 1,00,000.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  The immediate effect of withdrawing cash from a demand deposit account is a *reduction* in M1 (the narrowest measure of money supply), but not necessarily by the full amount.  The money multiplier effect comes into play, but not immediately.  The withdrawn cash is still within the economy; it hasn't disappeared.  The immediate impact is a shift in the composition of money supply, not a significant change in the aggregate amount.  Statement 1 suggests an increase, and Statement 2 suggests a decrease of the exact amount, both missing the nuances of the money multiplier effect.


**16. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  KCC provides short-term credit for the construction of family houses.
2.  KCC offers credit support for post-harvest expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  KCC primarily focuses on credit for agricultural activities and related expenses, not for non-agricultural purposes like house construction.  Including house construction as a KCC feature is a significant distractor, testing candidates' knowledge of the scheme's specific objectives.

Statement 2 is correct. KCC provides credit for various agricultural purposes, including post-harvest expenses like storage, transportation, and processing of agricultural produce.  This statement accurately reflects a key component of KCC support.


**17. With reference to Commercial Paper, Certificate of Deposit, Call Money, and Zero Coupon Bonds in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by eligible borrowers.
2.  Zero Coupon Bonds are short-term interest-bearing bonds issued by scheduled commercial banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by large and creditworthy corporations to raise short-term funds from the market.  The statement accurately describes CP's key characteristics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Zero Coupon Bonds do not pay periodic interest; instead, they are sold at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturity.  They are not necessarily short-term and are issued by various entities, not just scheduled commercial banks.  The statement misrepresents the nature of Zero Coupon Bonds, creating a significant distractor.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the characteristics of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India:**

1.  FDI involves debt servicing as a major characteristic.
2.  FDI is largely a non-debt creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FDI is primarily equity investment; it does not inherently involve debt servicing.  Debt financing is a separate mechanism.  The statement mistakenly links FDI with debt, creating a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  FDI is characterized by equity investment, which is a non-debt creating capital flow.  It represents ownership stakes in companies, not loans that require repayment with interest.  This statement accurately captures the core nature of FDI.


**19. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI Governor's appointment is subject to the approval of the Parliament.
2.  The RBI Governor derives authority primarily from the RBI Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI Governor is appointed by the Central Government, not subject to parliamentary approval.  The statement incorrectly locates the appointment authority, serving as a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RBI Governor's powers and functions are largely defined by the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934,  as amended from time to time.  This statement correctly identifies the primary source of the Governor's authority.


**20. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  UCBs are supervised and regulated solely by local boards established by State Governments.
2.  UCBs are authorized to issue both equity shares and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While State Governments play a role in overseeing UCBs, the supervision and regulation are not solely handled by local boards.  The RBI also has regulatory oversight over UCBs.  The statement simplifies the regulatory framework, creating a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  UCBs are permitted to issue both equity shares and preference shares to raise capital.  This statement accurately reflects the capital-raising mechanisms available to UCBs.


**21. Consider the following statements regarding factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields:**

1.  Actions of the United States Federal Reserve (US Fed) have minimal impact on Indian bond yields.
2.  Inflation and short-term interest rates significantly influence Indian bond yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Actions by the US Fed, particularly changes in US interest rates, can significantly influence Indian bond yields due to global capital flows and investor sentiment.  The statement minimizes the impact of global factors, creating a misleading distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. Inflation and short-term interest rates are major determinants of government bond yields in India.  Higher inflation expectations typically lead to higher bond yields, and changes in short-term rates influence the attractiveness of bonds relative to other short-term investments.  This statement accurately reflects the key drivers of bond yields.


**22. With reference to Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), consider the following:**

1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds are considered a form of FDI.
2.  Non-resident external deposits are considered a form of FDI.

Which of the above can be included in Foreign Direct Investments?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) can be considered a form of FDI if they meet the criteria of resulting in substantial ownership or control in an Indian company.  The conversion feature leads to direct investment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Non-resident external deposits (NRE accounts) are not FDIs.  They are deposits held by non-residents in Indian banks, representing debt rather than equity investment.  The statement misclassifies NRE deposits, creating a strong distractor.


**23. Consider the following statements regarding the effects of currency devaluation:**

1.  Devaluation necessarily improves a country's trade balance.
2.  Devaluation improves the competitiveness of domestic exports in foreign markets.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While devaluation can make exports cheaper and imports more expensive, it does not guarantee an improvement in the trade balance.  Other factors, such as price elasticity of demand for imports and exports, also play a significant role.  The statement presents an oversimplified view of the impact of devaluation, serving as a key distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. Devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper in foreign markets, enhancing their competitiveness.  This statement accurately reflects one of the primary effects of devaluation.


**24. With reference to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following:**

1.  Inflation-indexing wages contributes to demand-pull inflation.
2.  Rising interest rates contribute to demand-pull inflation.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Inflation-indexing wages means that wages are adjusted to keep pace with inflation. This leads to increased consumer spending and demand, fueling demand-pull inflation.  This statement correctly identifies a factor contributing to demand-pull inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rising interest rates are typically used to *combat* demand-pull inflation.  Higher interest rates reduce borrowing and spending, cooling down aggregate demand.  The statement presents the opposite relationship, creating a significant distractor.


**25. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) actions in response to economic conditions:**

1.  If inflation is too high, the RBI is likely to buy government securities.
2.  If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to sell dollars in the market.


Which of the statements given above are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. If inflation is too high, the RBI is likely to *sell* government securities (or employ other contractionary monetary policies) to reduce money supply and curb inflation. Buying government securities would increase money supply, worsening inflation.  This statement presents the opposite action, acting as a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  If the rupee is depreciating rapidly, the RBI would intervene in the foreign exchange market by selling dollars from its reserves to increase the supply of dollars and support the rupee's value.  This statement accurately describes a typical RBI response to rupee depreciation.


**26. With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  IIBs provide investors with protection against inflation uncertainty.
2.  The interest received and capital gains on IIBs are tax-exempt.

Which of the statements given above are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  IIBs are designed to protect investors from the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation.  The principal and interest payments on IIBs are adjusted based on inflation, preserving the real value of the investment.  This statement accurately describes the core function of IIBs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the tax treatment of IIBs may vary, it is not universally tax-exempt.  The tax implications depend on the specific rules and regulations in effect.  The statement presents a potentially misleading generalization regarding tax treatment, creating a plausible distractor.


**27. Consider the following statements regarding the potential impacts of a tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve:**

1.  A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve is likely to lead to capital flight from emerging markets like India.
2.  Devaluation of the domestic currency reduces the currency risk associated with External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

Which of the statements given above are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A tight US monetary policy (higher interest rates) typically attracts global capital to the US, leading to capital flight from emerging markets like India as investors seek higher returns in US dollar-denominated assets.  This statement accurately reflects the international capital flow dynamics in response to US monetary policy changes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Devaluation of the domestic currency *increases* the currency risk associated with ECBs, as borrowers face higher costs in repaying their loans denominated in foreign currencies.  The statement presents the opposite effect, creating a significant distractor.


**28. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1.  Convertible bonds typically offer a higher interest rate compared to non-convertible bonds due to the conversion option.
2.  The conversion option in convertible bonds provides some degree of protection against inflation for the bondholder.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Convertible bonds usually offer a *lower* interest rate than non-convertible bonds because the conversion option provides additional value to the investor.  The statement presents the opposite relationship, serving as a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The conversion option allows bondholders to benefit from potential increases in the equity value of the underlying company, which can act as a hedge against inflation.  The statement accurately describes the inflation hedge aspect of convertible bonds.



**1. With reference to India's foreign trade and its impact on aggregate demand, consider the following statements:**

1.  Increased imports of foreign goods lead to a decrease in aggregate demand for domestically produced goods due to leakages from the circular flow of income.
2.  Exports of domestically produced goods act as an injection into the circular flow of income, thereby increasing aggregate demand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the dual impact of foreign trade on aggregate demand within an open economy like India's. Statement 1 correctly identifies the leakage effect of imports. When Indian consumers purchase foreign goods, the money spent leaves the domestic circular flow, reducing the overall demand for domestically produced goods and services.  This is a key concept in macroeconomics, highlighting how international trade can influence a nation's economic activity.  Statement 2 is equally correct in describing the injection effect of exports.  When Indian firms export goods to foreign markets, this constitutes an inflow of money into the domestic economy, stimulating aggregate demand for domestically produced goods used in the production of exports or consumed as a result of increased income from exports. The interplay between these leakage and injection effects determines the net impact of foreign trade on a country's aggregate demand.  Therefore, both statements are essential components of understanding the macroeconomic implications of international trade.


**2. With reference to the international monetary system and national currencies, consider the following statements:**

1.  A national currency's acceptance as an international medium of exchange depends on its perceived stability in purchasing power.
2.  Governments often try to instill confidence in their currencies by pegging them to assets like gold, whose value is beyond their direct control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a crucial aspect of the international monetary system.  For a national currency to be widely accepted in international transactions, it must be perceived as stable and reliable in maintaining its purchasing power.  Fluctuations and uncertainty in a currency's value create risk for international traders and investors, making them less likely to use it.  This stability is essential for it to function effectively as a medium of exchange and a unit of account in global commerce.  Statement 2 correctly describes a common strategy employed by governments to boost confidence in their currencies.  By pegging their currency to a stable asset like gold (historically) or another major currency (currently), governments aim to reduce exchange rate volatility and provide a sense of security to domestic and foreign economic agents.  This strategy, however, has its limitations.  The ability to maintain the peg depends on the government's capacity to control its currency supply and respond to market pressures.  While the peg might initially boost confidence, significant economic shocks or inconsistent policies can threaten the stability of the peg. Therefore, both statements highlight important aspects of the challenges and strategies associated with international monetary stability and currency management.


**3. With reference to the balance of payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. The current account records transactions related to trade in goods and services, and transfer payments, but excludes capital movements.
2.  A current account deficit necessarily implies a net capital inflow, representing borrowing or asset sales to finance the deficit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the scope of the current account in the balance of payments. The current account summarizes a nation's transactions involving the exchange of goods and services (visible and invisible trade) and transfer payments (like remittances and foreign aid). It specifically excludes capital flows, which are recorded separately in the capital and financial account.  Understanding the distinction between the current and capital accounts is fundamental to analyzing a country's overall external economic position. Statement 2 correctly describes the relationship between a current account deficit and capital flows. If a country spends more on foreign goods and services (imports) than it earns from exports and other current account receipts, resulting in a deficit, it must finance this shortfall by either borrowing from abroad (capital inflow) or selling assets to foreign entities.  This fundamental accounting identity in international finance emphasizes that a current account deficit cannot persist indefinitely without corresponding capital inflows.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key principles of balance of payments accounting and the interrelationship between current and capital account transactions.


**4. With reference to the components of the balance of payments, consider the following statements:**

1.  The trade balance is the difference between exports and imports of goods, excluding services and transfer payments.
2.  The current account balance includes the trade balance, net income from investments, and net transfers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the trade balance as the net difference between a country's exports and imports of goods. This component focuses solely on the visible trade of physical goods, excluding services and transfer payments.  A positive trade balance indicates a trade surplus (exports exceeding imports), while a negative balance represents a trade deficit.  This is a crucial indicator of a country's competitiveness in international markets and its overall economic health. Statement 2 correctly describes the broader current account balance. The current account is a more comprehensive measure, encompassing not only the trade balance (goods) but also the net balance of trade in services (invisible trade), net income from investments (e.g., interest, dividends, profits), and net transfers (e.g., remittances, foreign aid).  This provides a more complete picture of a nation's international economic transactions during a specific period.  Therefore, both statements are essential for understanding the composition and significance of the balance of payments, differentiating between the narrow focus of the trade balance and the broader perspective of the current account.


**5.  With reference to the foreign exchange market and exchange rates, consider the following statements:**

1. The nominal exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another, expressed in monetary units.
2. The real exchange rate measures the relative price of foreign goods compared to domestic goods, considering both nominal exchange rates and price levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly defines the nominal exchange rate.  It is simply the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency.  For example, a nominal exchange rate of 75 rupees per US dollar means that one US dollar can be exchanged for 75 Indian rupees.  This is a widely used and readily available indicator in financial markets.  Understanding nominal exchange rates is crucial for international trade and investment decisions.  Statement 2 correctly defines the real exchange rate, which is a more nuanced measure than the nominal exchange rate. It considers the relative purchasing power of two currencies by incorporating both the nominal exchange rate and the price levels (inflation) in the two countries.  The real exchange rate reflects the relative cost of a basket of goods and services in one country compared to another, after adjusting for currency exchange.  This is a more accurate measure of a country's competitiveness in international trade because it accounts for differences in price levels across countries.  Therefore, both statements provide accurate definitions of key concepts essential for understanding exchange rate dynamics and their implications for international trade and economic activity.


**6. With reference to the determination of income in an open economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The open economy multiplier is smaller than the closed economy multiplier because imports represent a leakage from the circular flow of income.
2. An increase in exports increases aggregate demand and equilibrium income, while an autonomous increase in imports reduces equilibrium income.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately explains why the open economy multiplier is smaller than the closed economy multiplier.  In a closed economy, an increase in autonomous spending (like government spending or investment) leads to a larger increase in income because the entire increase in spending circulates within the economy, boosting aggregate demand repeatedly. However, in an open economy, a portion of the increased spending leaks out as imports, reducing the multiplier effect. The marginal propensity to import (the proportion of additional income spent on imports) determines the extent of this leakage.  A higher marginal propensity to import leads to a smaller multiplier.  Therefore, the open economy multiplier is always smaller than its closed economy counterpart. Statement 2 correctly describes the impact of changes in exports and imports on aggregate demand and equilibrium income. An increase in exports directly increases aggregate demand, leading to a rise in equilibrium income through the multiplier effect. Conversely, an autonomous increase in imports (not induced by changes in domestic income) reduces aggregate demand for domestically produced goods, leading to a decrease in equilibrium income.  Therefore, both statements illustrate key differences between the income determination mechanisms in closed and open economies.  Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for formulating effective macroeconomic policies in a globalized world.


**7. With reference to autonomous and accommodating transactions in the balance of payments, consider the following statements:**

1. Autonomous transactions are independent of the balance of payments position and are primarily driven by economic incentives.
2. Accommodating transactions are determined by the net effect of autonomous transactions and are designed to offset any imbalances in the balance of payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly defines autonomous transactions. These are international economic transactions that are initiated independently of the current state of the balance of payments.  They are primarily driven by factors such as profit motives, individual preferences, or investment opportunities.  Examples of autonomous transactions include private investment, trade based on market demand, and tourism.  These transactions are considered "above the line" items in the balance of payments accounting.  Statement 2 accurately describes the role of accommodating transactions. These transactions are undertaken to adjust for any imbalances caused by autonomous transactions.  If autonomous receipts exceed autonomous payments, a balance of payments surplus occurs, and accommodating transactions might involve an increase in foreign exchange reserves. Conversely, if autonomous payments exceed receipts, resulting in a deficit, accommodating transactions might involve drawing down reserves, borrowing from abroad, or other measures to offset the imbalance. These are considered "below the line" items.  Therefore, both statements offer a clear and accurate distinction between autonomous and accommodating transactions and their roles in the balance of payments mechanism.  Understanding this distinction is crucial for analyzing and managing a country's external economic relations.


**8. With reference to India's foreign exchange reserves, consider the following statements:**

1. India's foreign exchange reserves primarily consist of foreign currency assets, gold holdings of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).
2. Loans from foreign countries and international organizations are included in India's foreign exchange reserves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the major components of India's foreign exchange reserves.  The reserves are primarily comprised of foreign currency assets held by the RBI, representing various foreign currencies.  These assets are readily available for use in international transactions.  Gold holdings of the RBI also contribute significantly to the reserves, acting as a store of value and a means of settling international payments.  Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), an international reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), are also included.  These components are liquid and readily usable to meet international payment obligations. Statement 2 is incorrect. Loans from foreign countries or international organizations are not typically considered part of a country's foreign exchange reserves.  These loans represent liabilities, not assets.  Reserves, by definition, represent assets available for immediate use in international transactions, whereas loans are future obligations.  Therefore, only statement 1 correctly identifies the primary components of India's foreign exchange reserves.  It is important to distinguish between a country's assets (reserves) and its liabilities (loans) when assessing its overall external financial position.


**9. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FDI includes investments made by foreign companies establishing subsidiaries or holding majority equity in Indian companies.
2.  Portfolio investments, such as buying shares on stock exchanges, are considered FDI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a significant aspect of FDI.  Foreign direct investment is characterized by a foreign entity establishing a lasting interest in an enterprise in another country. This can take the form of setting up subsidiaries, acquiring a controlling stake (majority equity) in an existing company, or engaging in joint ventures.  The key feature is the establishment of a lasting managerial influence or control over the invested enterprise.  This distinguishes FDI from portfolio investments. Statement 2 is incorrect. Portfolio investments involve the purchase of securities (such as stocks and bonds) on financial markets without the intent of gaining managerial control.  While these investments can contribute to capital flows into a country, they are not classified as FDI.  The distinction between FDI and portfolio investments is important for policy purposes, as FDI is typically associated with greater technological transfer, job creation, and long-term economic benefits compared to portfolio investment.  Therefore, only statement 1 provides a correct description of FDI in the context of India or any other country.  Understanding this distinction is crucial for policymakers seeking to attract and leverage the benefits of foreign investment.


**10. With reference to the factors influencing the price of a currency in the international market, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Bank directly determines the price of any currency in the international market.
2. The demand for goods and services provided by a country and its economic potential significantly influence its currency's price.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The World Bank does not directly determine the price (exchange rate) of currencies in the international market.  Exchange rates are primarily determined by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market.  While the World Bank plays a vital role in international finance and development, it does not directly intervene in setting currency prices.  Its influence is indirect, through its impact on global economic conditions and financial flows. Statement 2 is correct. The price of a currency in the international market is fundamentally influenced by the demand for its goods and services and the country's overall economic potential. A country with strong economic fundamentals (high growth, stable political environment, strong institutions) and high demand for its exports will typically have a stronger currency.  Conversely, countries with weak economic performance and low export demand will usually have weaker currencies.  Other factors like government policies, interest rates, and investor sentiment also play a role, but the demand for goods and services and overall economic strength are primary drivers.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the key determinants of a currency's price in the international market.  Understanding these determinants is crucial for policymakers and investors alike.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a deep understanding of the concepts discussed.


**1. With reference to India's foreign trade and its impact on aggregate demand, consider the following statements:**

1.  Increased imports of foreign goods lead to a leakage from the circular flow of income, thus decreasing aggregate demand.
2.  Exports inject funds into the circular flow, boosting aggregate demand for domestically produced goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the dual impact of foreign trade on aggregate demand. Statement 1 correctly identifies that increased imports represent a leakage—money spent on foreign goods doesn't circulate within the domestic economy, reducing aggregate demand.  Statement 2 is also correct; exports represent an injection—money earned from selling goods abroad enters the domestic circular flow, stimulating demand for domestically produced goods and services.  The interplay between these injections and leakages significantly influences a nation's overall economic activity.  Understanding this dynamic is crucial for formulating effective macroeconomic policies. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the complete picture of how imports and exports separately affect aggregate demand.


**2. Consider the following statements concerning the international monetary system and national currencies:**

1.  A nation's currency will be accepted internationally only if it maintains stable purchasing power.
2.  Governments build confidence in their currencies by pegging them to assets like gold or other stable currencies, ensuring free convertibility at a fixed price.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of the international monetary system.  Statement 1 highlights the fundamental requirement for international acceptance of a currency:  confidence in its relative stability.  Fluctuating or rapidly depreciating currencies are unreliable mediums of exchange and units of account in international trade. Statement 2 correctly points out a historical method used by governments to foster this confidence—pegging their currency to a stable asset like gold or another strong currency.  This demonstrates a commitment to maintaining value, although the success of this approach depends on the ability to maintain the promised convertibility at the stated price. The credibility of this system is often challenged by factors like the ability to freely convert unlimited amounts and the stability of the asset used for the peg.  Options (a), (b), and (d) overlook the crucial interdependence of currency stability and international confidence.


**3. With reference to a country's Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. The current account records transactions in goods and services, but excludes capital flows.
2. A current account deficit necessitates financing through net capital inflow or reduction in foreign exchange reserves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The current account of the BoP encompasses transactions in goods (visible trade) and services (invisible trade), *including* income from investments and unilateral transfers (like remittances and foreign aid). Capital flows are recorded separately in the capital account.  Statement 2 is correct. A current account deficit implies a country is spending more on foreign goods and services than it is earning from exports, creating a shortfall.  This deficit must be financed either by attracting net capital inflows (foreign investment) or by depleting its foreign exchange reserves.  The BoP must always balance, meaning any deficit in one account must be offset by a surplus in another. Options (a), (c), and (d) fail to grasp the fundamental principle of BoP accounting and the relationship between the current and capital accounts.


**4. With reference to the components of a country's Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1.  Invisible trade includes factor income (investment income) and non-factor income (tourism, shipping).
2.  The capital account records international purchases and sales of assets, such as stocks and bonds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe components of a country's Balance of Payments. Statement 1 correctly defines invisible trade as encompassing both factor income (returns on investments) and non-factor income (services like tourism and transportation).  These are transactions that don't involve physical goods crossing borders.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the capital account as recording the flow of capital—purchases and sales of assets like stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments.  These transactions directly affect a country's foreign assets and liabilities. The distinction between current and capital accounts is crucial in understanding a nation's international economic position.  Incorrect options fail to differentiate the components of the BoP accurately.


**5. Consider the following statements about autonomous and accommodating transactions in the BoP:**

1. Autonomous transactions are independent of the BoP's state, driven by factors like profit motives.
2. Accommodating transactions, like official reserve transactions, are determined by the net outcome of autonomous items.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe the nature of autonomous and accommodating transactions within the balance of payments framework.  Autonomous transactions are driven by independent economic decisions, such as private investment or trade based on market forces and individual/firm incentives, not the current state of the balance of payments.  Accommodating transactions, conversely, are those undertaken to offset imbalances created by autonomous transactions. Official reserve transactions, where a central bank buys or sells foreign currency to maintain exchange rate stability, are a prime example of an accommodating transaction. These transactions adjust to maintain equilibrium in the overall balance of payments.  Incorrect options fail to grasp the distinction and relationship between these two types of transactions.


**6. With reference to the foreign exchange market and exchange rates, consider the following statements:**

1. The exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another.
2. The real exchange rate considers relative price levels in different countries, reflecting purchasing power parity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate descriptions of key concepts in international finance.  Statement 1 correctly defines the exchange rate as the price of one currency in units of another.  For example, a USD/INR exchange rate of 82 means one US dollar can be exchanged for 82 Indian rupees.  Statement 2 correctly introduces the real exchange rate, which adjusts the nominal exchange rate for differences in price levels between countries.  This gives a more accurate reflection of the relative purchasing power of currencies.  Purchasing power parity (PPP) suggests that, in the long run, exchange rates should adjust to equalize the purchasing power of currencies across countries.  Incorrect options demonstrate a lack of understanding of exchange rate dynamics.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the determination of exchange rates:**

1. Exchange rates are solely determined by government policies and interventions.
2. Market forces of supply and demand play a significant role in determining exchange rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While governments can influence exchange rates through policies like currency interventions (buying or selling their currency in the foreign exchange market), they are not the sole determinant.  Market forces—supply and demand for currencies driven by international trade, capital flows, and investor sentiment—play a much more significant role in the day-to-day fluctuations of exchange rates.  Statement 2 correctly points out this market-driven aspect.  In a free-floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate adjusts to balance supply and demand.  However, it's important to note that even in managed float regimes, market forces exert a considerable influence.  Incorrect options fail to acknowledge the interplay between market forces and government intervention.


**8. With reference to the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMF primarily focuses on providing long-term development loans to developing countries.
2. The IMF plays a crucial role in promoting international monetary cooperation and assisting countries facing balance-of-payments problems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IMF does provide financing, its loans are typically short-term and conditional, aimed at addressing immediate balance-of-payments crises or supporting economic reforms.  Long-term development financing is primarily the domain of institutions like the World Bank. Statement 2 accurately reflects the IMF's core mandate: fostering international monetary cooperation and stability.  It provides financial assistance and policy advice to member countries facing balance-of-payments difficulties, aiming to prevent and resolve financial crises.  The IMF also plays a significant role in monitoring global economic conditions and providing surveillance over member countries' economic policies. Incorrect options fail to accurately represent the IMF's functions and its role in the global financial system.


**9. Consider the following statements comparing the World Bank and the IMF:**

1. The World Bank's primary focus is on promoting international monetary cooperation, while the IMF prioritizes development lending.
2. Both institutions are headquartered in Washington, D.C., and are key players in the global financial architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Bank's primary focus is on providing development assistance and financing for poverty reduction and economic growth in developing countries. The IMF's main focus is on promoting international monetary cooperation and providing financial assistance to countries facing balance-of-payments problems.  Statement 2 is correct. Both the World Bank and the IMF are headquartered in Washington, D.C., and are key Bretton Woods institutions, playing pivotal roles in the global financial system.  They work together, but with distinct mandates, to promote global economic stability and development. Incorrect options misrepresent the core functions of these two crucial international financial organizations.


**10. With reference to Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) of the IMF, consider the following statements:**

1. SDRs are a type of freely usable currency that can be used for direct transactions like purchasing goods.
2. The allocation of SDRs to member countries is based on their relative economic size and influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SDRs are international reserve assets, not a freely usable currency in the sense that they cannot be used directly for everyday transactions like buying goods and services.  They are held by central banks as part of their foreign exchange reserves and can be exchanged for other freely usable currencies. Statement 2 is correct.  The allocation of SDRs to IMF member countries is based on a quota system that reflects their relative economic size and position in the global economy.  Larger economies receive a larger allocation, reflecting their greater influence and role in the international monetary system.  The SDR allocation formula considers various factors, including GDP, openness of the economy, economic variability, and international reserves. Incorrect options reveal a misunderstanding of the nature and function of SDRs within the international monetary system.


**11. Consider the following statements concerning India's foreign investment:**

1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) involves investment in a listed Indian company of less than 10% of its equity capital.
2. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) involves investment in the capital instruments of an Indian company where the investment is less than 10% of the equity capital of a listed Indian company.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FDI involves investment of 10% or more of the equity capital of a listed Indian company or investment in an unlisted Indian company.  A foreign investor with less than a 10% stake is generally considered a portfolio investor. Statement 2 is correct. FPI is defined as investment in the capital instruments of an Indian company where such investment is less than 10 percent of the equity capital of a listed Indian company.  FPIs are more short-term and focused on capital appreciation than FDI, which involves a longer-term commitment and often managerial control.  The distinction between FDI and FPI is crucial in understanding the nature and impact of foreign capital flows on the Indian economy.  Incorrect options highlight a lack of clarity on the definitions of FDI and FPI.


**12. With reference to the regulation of foreign investment in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requires prior approval for all foreign direct investments (FDI).
2. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) sets the rules and policies for foreign investment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While RBI monitors foreign exchange flows related to FDI, most FDI inflows in India now follow the "automatic route," requiring no prior RBI approval.  Approval is needed only for investments in specific sectors or exceeding certain thresholds, as determined by sector-specific regulations and policies. Statement 2 is correct.  The DPIIT, under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, plays the primary role in setting the overall policy framework and regulations for foreign direct investment in India.  It issues press releases clarifying FDI policy and guidelines. While other ministries and departments handle approvals for specific sectors, the DPIIT sets the overarching framework.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the roles of the RBI and DPIIT in regulating FDI.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) and American Depository Receipts (ADRs):**

1. GDRs and ADRs are essentially the same thing, representing shares of a foreign company listed on US exchanges.
2.  ADRs are used by companies based outside the US to avoid the costs of directly listing their shares on US stock exchanges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both GDRs and ADRs represent shares of foreign companies, they differ in their listing location.  ADRs are specifically listed on US stock exchanges, while GDRs can be listed on exchanges in various countries.  Both serve a similar purpose: allowing foreign investors to easily trade shares of companies not directly listed in their home market. Statement 2 is correct. Companies often use ADRs (and GDRs) as a less expensive and less administratively burdensome alternative to a full listing on US exchanges.  This allows them to tap into the large US investor base without incurring the significant expenses and regulatory hurdles associated with a direct listing.  Incorrect options show a lack of understanding of the distinct features of ADRs and GDRs.


**14.  With reference to Systemically Important Institutions (SIIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) designates Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) based on asset size.
2.  Only banks are designated as SIIs in India; other financial institutions are not included in this classification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI identifies and designates Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) based on criteria such as asset size, exceeding a certain percentage of the GDP.  These banks are deemed to pose a higher risk to the overall financial system due to their size and interconnectedness. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SII designation isn't limited to banks.  Other financial institutions, such as Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), insurance companies, and financial market infrastructures (FMIs), can also be designated as systemically important if they meet specific criteria set by their respective regulators (RBI, IRDAI, SEBI).  Incorrect options demonstrate a limited understanding of the scope of the SII framework in India.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) sources of income:**

1.  The RBI earns income from its investments in government securities, but not from foreign currency assets.
2.  Seigniorage, the profit from money creation, is a significant source of RBI's revenue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI earns income from a variety of sources, including its holdings of both government securities and foreign currency assets.  Interest earned on these investments contributes significantly to the RBI's overall revenue. Statement 2 is correct. Seigniorage is a major component of RBI's income.  It's the difference between the face value of the currency issued and the cost of production (printing and distribution).  This profit accrues to the RBI as it effectively creates money by issuing currency notes and coins. Other sources of income include interest on bank balances maintained with the RBI, commissions earned from acting as a debt manager for the government, and income from other operations. Incorrect options reflect an incomplete understanding of the RBI's diverse revenue streams.


**16. With reference to the RBI's Economic Capital Framework (ECF), consider the following statements:**

1. The ECF aims to ensure the RBI maintains sufficient capital reserves to handle financial system crises.
2. The ECF mandates that all of the RBI's net income be transferred to the government as profit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A primary objective of the RBI's ECF is to ensure it has adequate capital reserves to absorb potential losses and maintain financial stability during crises.  The framework helps determine the appropriate level of capital reserves based on risk assessments. Statement 2 is incorrect. While a significant portion of the RBI's net income is transferred to the government as a dividend, the ECF doesn't mandate the transfer of *all* net income.  A part of the net income is allocated to the capital reserve to strengthen the RBI's financial position and its ability to respond to future challenges.  The exact proportion transferred to the government varies depending on the risk profile of the financial system and the RBI's capital adequacy. Incorrect options show a misunderstanding of the ECF's objectives and the allocation of RBI's profits.


**17. Consider the following statements about cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs):**

1. Cryptocurrencies are legal tender issued and regulated by central banks.
2. CBDCs aim to provide a regulated, digital form of central bank money, complementing existing physical currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital assets, not legal tender issued or regulated by central banks.  They operate outside the traditional financial system and are not backed by a government or central bank.  Their value is derived from market demand and technological factors. Statement 2 is correct.  CBDCs are digital forms of central bank money, designed to offer the benefits of digital payments while maintaining the trust and stability associated with central bank-issued currency.  They are intended to complement, not replace, physical cash.  The introduction of CBDCs is driven by the desire to provide a safe, efficient, and regulated digital alternative to private cryptocurrencies and to maintain central bank control over the monetary system. Incorrect options reveal a lack of understanding of the fundamental differences between cryptocurrencies and CBDCs.


**18. With reference to the e-Rupee (CBDC), consider the following statements:**

1.  e-Rupee transactions between CBDC wallets are recorded in the banks' Core Banking Solutions (CBS).
2.  e-Rupee is designed to replace physical cash entirely, eliminating the need for traditional currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A key feature of e-Rupee transactions between CBDC wallets is their anonymity; they are not recorded in banks' Core Banking Solutions (CBS). This is intended to mimic the privacy offered by cash transactions.  Transactions involving transfer from bank accounts to CBDC wallets, however, *are* recorded in the CBS. Statement 2 is incorrect. e-Rupee is designed to *complement* physical cash, not replace it entirely.  It aims to provide a digital alternative for convenient and efficient transactions while maintaining the trust and security associated with central bank-backed currency.  The coexistence of physical and digital currency is a core principle of CBDC design.  Incorrect options reflect a misunderstanding of the e-Rupee's functionality and intended role in the monetary system.



**1. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1.  A current account deficit is always financed by a net capital inflow.
2.  The overall balance of payments deficit (surplus) is the decrease (increase) in official reserves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A country's current account reflects its net trade in goods and services, as well as net transfers. If a country spends more on imports than it earns from exports and transfers, it runs a current account deficit. To finance this deficit, the country must either borrow from abroad or sell assets (like stocks or bonds) to foreign entities. This inflow of capital offsets the current account deficit, maintaining the overall balance of payments.  Therefore, a current account deficit necessarily implies a net capital inflow.

Statement 2 is also correct. The balance of payments records all international transactions.  If a country has a deficit (meaning more payments to foreigners than receipts from them), it must draw down its reserves of foreign exchange to cover the shortfall. Conversely, a surplus leads to an increase in foreign exchange reserves. The change in official reserves thus represents the overall balance of payments – the balancing item that ensures the BoP always sums to zero.


**2. With reference to the foreign exchange market, consider the following statements:**

1. The bilateral nominal exchange rate is the price of one unit of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency.
2.  Purchasing power parity (PPP) implies that the real exchange rate is equal to two.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The bilateral nominal exchange rate is a crucial concept in international finance. It directly expresses the value of one currency relative to another – for example, how many rupees are needed to buy one US dollar. This is the commonly used definition in economic literature and is what's quoted in financial markets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a theory that attempts to equalize the purchasing power of different currencies.  It posits that goods should cost the same in different countries when measured in the same currency.  Therefore, if PPP holds, the real exchange rate would be equal to *one*, not two.  A real exchange rate of one signifies that the purchasing power of currencies is identical across countries for a given basket of goods.


**3. With reference to the determination of income in an open economy, consider the following statements:**

1. The open economy multiplier is smaller than the closed economy multiplier because of import leakages.
2. An increase in autonomous export demand increases equilibrium income, while an increase in autonomous import demand decreases it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The multiplier effect describes how an initial change in spending (e.g., government spending, investment) ripples through the economy, leading to a larger overall change in income.  In a closed economy, all spending remains within the domestic economy. However, in an open economy, some portion of increased income will be spent on imports, representing a leakage from the circular flow. This leakage reduces the magnitude of the multiplier effect, resulting in a smaller overall increase in national income compared to a closed economy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Exports represent an injection into the circular flow of income, increasing aggregate demand and national income.  Conversely, imports represent a leakage, drawing demand away from domestically produced goods and services.  An increase in autonomous export demand (demand independent of domestic income) directly boosts aggregate demand, leading to an increase in equilibrium income. Conversely, an increase in autonomous import demand reduces aggregate demand, causing a decrease in equilibrium income.


**4. With reference to the Indian Rupee and international currencies, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Rupee's free float with other international currencies implies that its exchange rate is determined solely by market forces.
2.  A managed float system implies that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) never intervenes in the foreign exchange market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  While the Indian Rupee operates under a managed float system, the term "free float" describes a system where the exchange rate is determined entirely by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, with no central bank intervention.  Although India's system involves some intervention, the fundamental principle is that market forces play a dominant role in determining the Rupee's value against other currencies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A managed float system implies that the central bank (the RBI in India's case) *does* intervene in the foreign exchange market to moderate volatility and influence the exchange rate.  While the exchange rate is largely market-determined, the central bank may buy or sell foreign currencies to prevent excessive fluctuations or to achieve specific policy objectives.  The RBI's intervention is not aimed at fixing the exchange rate at a specific level but rather to manage its movements within a certain range.


**5. With reference to the  Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Under the LRS, resident individuals can remit up to $250,000 annually without specific approvals for various transactions including overseas education and property purchases.
2. The LRS represents India's complete removal of all capital controls on foreign exchange movements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The LRS allows resident Indians to send a significant amount of money abroad each year for various purposes without needing prior government approval. This includes education, travel, medical expenses, investment in foreign securities, and property purchases.  This liberalization eases restrictions on individual foreign exchange transactions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The LRS is a step towards liberalization but doesn't represent a complete removal of capital controls.  While it significantly relaxes restrictions on individual remittances, other capital controls remain in place in the Indian economy to manage overall foreign exchange flows and protect the domestic financial system from external shocks.  India still maintains controls on certain capital account transactions to maintain macroeconomic stability and manage its balance of payments.


**6. With reference to monetary policy and inflation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Demand-pull inflation is primarily caused by an excess of aggregate demand over aggregate supply.
2. Cost-push inflation is mainly caused by a decrease in aggregate demand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Demand-pull inflation arises when the overall demand for goods and services in an economy outstrips the economy's capacity to produce them. This excess demand pushes up prices across the board. Factors contributing to this include increased government spending, expansionary monetary policy, or a surge in consumer spending.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Cost-push inflation stems from increases in production costs (e.g., wages, raw materials) that are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.  While a decrease in aggregate demand *can* contribute to lower inflation (or even deflation), it is not the primary cause of cost-push inflation. Cost-push inflation is a supply-side phenomenon, whereas a decrease in aggregate demand is a demand-side phenomenon.


**7. With reference to  inflation and related concepts, consider the following statements:**

1. Disinflation refers to a situation where the rate of inflation is decreasing, but prices are still rising.
2. Deflation is characterized by a sustained increase in the general price level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Disinflation signifies a slowdown in the rate of inflation.  It means that the rate at which prices are rising is decreasing, even though prices themselves are still increasing. For example, if inflation falls from 10% to 5%, this is disinflation.  The economy is still experiencing inflation, but at a slower pace.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Deflation refers to a sustained decrease in the general price level, the opposite of inflation.  Deflation can be harmful to an economy because it can lead to decreased consumer spending and investment, as people postpone purchases hoping for further price drops. This can lead to a deflationary spiral.


**8. With reference to India's economic reforms, consider the following statements:**

1. The privatization of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) aimed to improve financial discipline and facilitate modernization.
2.  The removal of export duties on certain goods aimed to decrease the competitive position of Indian goods in international markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key objective of PSU privatization in India was to enhance efficiency and competitiveness. By transferring ownership and management to the private sector, the government aimed to improve financial discipline, encourage modernization, and attract private investment.  Privatization was also intended to reduce the fiscal burden on the government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The removal of export duties is a policy designed to *increase* the competitiveness of Indian goods in the global market.  By eliminating these duties, Indian exporters can offer their products at lower prices, making them more attractive to international buyers and boosting exports.  The opposite would hinder competitiveness.


**9. With reference to the impact of globalization on India, consider the following statements:**

1. Globalization led to a significant increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and foreign exchange reserves in India.
2. Globalization has consistently benefited all sectors of the Indian economy equally, leading to uniform growth across the board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's economic liberalization and integration into the global economy (globalization) resulted in a substantial increase in FDI inflows.  This was driven by increased investor confidence and the opening up of various sectors to foreign investment.  Concurrently, India's foreign exchange reserves grew significantly as a result of increased exports, FDI, and remittances.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While globalization has spurred significant economic growth in India, its impact has been uneven across sectors.  Some sectors, particularly services (especially IT), have thrived, while others, such as agriculture, have faced challenges adjusting to increased international competition.  The benefits of globalization have not been uniformly distributed across all segments of the Indian economy, leading to disparities in growth and development.


**10. With reference to the World Trade Organization (WTO), consider the following statements:**

1. The WTO's primary aim is to establish a rule-based trading regime to ensure fair competition and reduce trade barriers.
2. The WTO has completely eliminated all forms of trade protectionism among its member countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core function of the WTO is to create a multilateral trading system based on agreed-upon rules. This framework aims to reduce trade barriers (tariffs, quotas, etc.) and promote fair competition among member nations.  The WTO provides a mechanism for resolving trade disputes and enforcing rules, striving to create a more predictable and transparent international trading environment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the WTO aims to reduce trade barriers and promote free trade, it does not eliminate all forms of trade protectionism.  Member countries are permitted to use certain trade protection measures under specific circumstances (e.g., anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties) to safeguard their domestic industries from unfair competition or to address serious economic problems.  The WTO's rules provide a framework for these measures, but they are not entirely prohibited.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer, a detailed explanation, and analysis of distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  A trade secret, unlike a patent, requires registration to obtain legal protection.
2.  Information qualifies as a trade secret only if it is publicly known or easily accessible.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Trade secrets are protected without registration, a key distinction from patents and other intellectual property rights.  The protection arises from the secrecy and the steps taken to maintain that secrecy, not from any formal registration process.  This allows for indefinite protection, unlike the limited duration of patents.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  A trade secret, by definition, *must* be secret.  The information must not be generally known within the relevant circles that deal with that type of information, and it must have commercial value because it is secret.  Public knowledge or easy accessibility negate the very nature of a trade secret.  The text explicitly states that the information must be secret and not readily accessible.


**2. With reference to Geographical Indications (GIs), consider the following statements:**

1.  A GI tag prevents others from using the same production techniques as those specified in the GI standards.
2.  The registration of a GI is valid for an unlimited period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A GI protects the *sign* used on products originating from a specific geographical area, signifying qualities or reputation linked to that origin.  It does *not* prevent others from using the same production techniques; only the use of the protected geographical indication itself is restricted.  The text clearly states that protection does not extend to preventing the use of the same production techniques.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The registration of a GI is for a period of ten years, renewable from time to time. This is explicitly mentioned in the text.  Unlimited protection is a characteristic of trade secrets, not GIs.


**3. With reference to Industrial Designs in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Industrial designs are protected under the Design Act of 2000, requiring registration for protection.
2.  The Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks is responsible for the registration of industrial designs under the Design Act 2000.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Industrial designs in India find legal protection under the Design Act 2000.  The act mandates registration to secure protection for the ornamental or aesthetic aspects of an article.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Controller General of Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks, under the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, acts as the "Controller of Designs" for the Design Act 2000, responsible for registration and issuing certificates.  The text directly states this responsibility.


**4. With reference to the TRIPS agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. TRIPS establishes minimum standards of intellectual property protection for all WTO members, expanding upon pre-existing WIPO conventions.
2. TRIPS solely focuses on establishing intellectual property laws, leaving enforcement entirely to individual member countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The TRIPS agreement builds upon the Paris and Berne Conventions, addressing gaps and strengthening protection standards.  It sets minimum requirements for intellectual property protection across WTO member countries, ensuring a baseline level of safeguarding for intellectual property rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. TRIPS emphasizes not only the establishment of intellectual property laws but also their *enforcement*. The agreement mandates that governments ensure effective enforcement mechanisms, with sufficient penalties to deter infringement.  It emphasizes that the procedures must be fair and equitable.


**5. With reference to Generic Drugs and Compulsory Licensing, consider the following statements:**

1. A voluntary license for a generic drug is granted solely through legal provisions within the Indian Patents Act, 1970.
2. A compulsory license can be issued by the government during a national emergency, allowing for the manufacture of generic versions of a drug.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Voluntary licensing for generic drugs relies on mutual contractual agreements between the patent holder and the licensee.  There's no specific legal provision within the Indian Patents Act, 1970, mandating or governing this type of licensing.  The text explicitly states this.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Patents Act, 1970, allows for compulsory licensing under specific circumstances, including national emergencies or extreme urgency (like a pandemic). This allows the government to authorize the manufacture of generic versions to address public health needs or affordability concerns.


**6. With reference to the Indian economy's potential GDP, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in absolute and per capita real GNP always indicates a higher level of economic development.
2. High savings in an economy always result in a significant increase in output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Increases in real GNP do not automatically translate to higher economic development.  Factors like poverty, unemployment, and income inequality can significantly impact the overall development level, even with rising GNP.  The text explicitly points this out.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  High savings do not guarantee a significant output increase.  Factors like a high capital-output ratio (meaning more investment is needed to generate a unit of output), inefficient resource allocation, or weak administrative machinery can hinder the conversion of savings into productive capital and economic growth.  The text highlights the role of the capital-output ratio.


**7. With reference to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and India's economy, consider the following statements:**

1. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing prices of similar goods and services in different countries.
2.  In terms of PPP dollars, India is consistently ranked among the world's top three largest economies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing the cost of a standard basket of goods and services in different countries, adjusting for differences in purchasing power. This provides a more realistic comparison of economic size than nominal exchange rates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's economy is large, its ranking in terms of PPP dollars is not consistently among the top three. The text mentions India's ranking as the sixth-largest economy in terms of PPP dollars, indicating a lower ranking than claimed in statement 2.


**8. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The weight of food in the CPI is lower than that in the WPI.
2.  The RBI currently uses the WPI as its primary measure of inflation for monetary policy decisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The weight of food in the CPI is significantly *higher* than in the WPI. The CPI reflects consumer spending patterns, where food holds a substantial share for many households, unlike the WPI which focuses on wholesale prices across a broader range of goods.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The RBI has shifted towards using the CPI as its key measure of inflation for monetary policy decisions, recognizing its closer connection to consumer price changes and their impact on household welfare.  The text indicates that the RBI has *adopted* the CPI, not the WPI.


**9. With reference to factors affecting market demand, consider the following statements:**

1. The market demand for a good increases if the price of its complement increases.
2.  The market demand for an inferior good increases if the income of consumers increases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Complementary goods are those consumed together (e.g., cars and gasoline). An increase in the price of a complement reduces the demand for the other good because consumers will buy less of both.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Inferior goods are those for which demand decreases as consumer income rises. Consumers tend to switch to superior substitutes as their income increases.  Therefore, an increase in consumer income would decrease the demand for an inferior good.


**10. With reference to the Indian economy's exchange rates, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates a depreciation of the rupee.
2.  An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) always indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in NEER indicates an *appreciation* of the rupee relative to a basket of other currencies.  A higher NEER means it takes more units of foreign currencies to buy one rupee.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While an increase in REER can sometimes suggest improved trade competitiveness, it's not always the case.  REER considers both nominal exchange rates and relative price levels. An increase in REER could be due to higher domestic inflation, making exports less competitive despite a stronger nominal exchange rate.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding Bitcoins:**

1. Bitcoins are centrally tracked and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India.
2.  Bitcoin transactions can be conducted anonymously, without revealing the identities of the transacting parties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bitcoins operate on a decentralized, blockchain-based system, not under the control of any central bank or government.  This is a defining feature of cryptocurrencies.

Statement 2 is correct. Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, meaning they are linked to Bitcoin addresses rather than directly to individuals' identities.  While the blockchain records all transactions, it does not automatically reveal the real-world identities of the users.  This allows for a degree of anonymity, though not complete untraceability.


**12. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1. It aims primarily at providing financial assistance to farmers for specific crops.
2. It focuses on bringing small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) primarily targets small entrepreneurs and micro-businesses, providing them with access to credit.  While some farmers may benefit indirectly, the scheme's core focus is not agricultural lending.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key objective of MUDRA Yojana is to bring small businesses into the formal financial system, providing them with access to institutional credit and reducing their dependence on informal sources.


**13. With reference to the Government's Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  These schemes aim to reduce India's reliance on gold imports.
2.  They primarily encourage Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme aim to mobilize idle gold held by households and institutions, reducing the demand for imported gold and improving the country's current account balance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. These schemes are not primarily designed to attract FDI in the gold and jewelry sector. Their focus is on domestic gold mobilization and utilization.


**14. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1. NPCI's primary role is to facilitate the operation of the RuPay card payment scheme.
2. NPCI plays a significant role in promoting financial inclusion in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NPCI is the entity behind the RuPay card payment scheme, a key initiative to promote domestic payment systems and reduce reliance on international payment networks.

Statement 2 is also correct. NPCI's various initiatives, including the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), have significantly contributed to financial inclusion by increasing access to digital payment services, especially in rural and underserved areas.


**15. With reference to the purpose of Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. SFBs primarily focus on providing credit to large corporate entities.
2. SFBs are designed to encourage entrepreneurship, particularly in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SFBs are specifically intended to cater to the financial needs of small businesses, micro-enterprises, and underserved communities, not large corporations.

Statement 2 is correct. A key objective of establishing SFBs is to foster entrepreneurship, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas by providing easier access to credit and financial services for those who traditionally lack it.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the "Merchant Discount Rate":**

1. It represents the incentive given to a merchant by a bank for accepting card payments.
2. It is a charge levied by banks on merchants for accepting payments through debit cards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The merchant discount rate (MDR) is not an incentive; rather, it's a fee that merchants pay to banks for processing card payments.

Statement 2 is correct. MDR represents the percentage fee that merchants pay to banks for enabling card-based transactions.  This fee covers the transaction processing costs for the bank.


**17. With reference to legal tender money, consider the following statements:**

1. Legal tender money refers to metallic money in circulation within a country.
2.  A creditor is legally obligated to accept legal tender money in settlement of debts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Legal tender encompasses not just metallic money but also paper currency and other forms of money that a creditor is legally required to accept.

Statement 2 is correct.  The defining characteristic of legal tender is that creditors must accept it to settle debts, making it a compulsory means of payment for discharging financial obligations.


**18. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and government securities:**

1. The RBI manages and services both Central and State Government securities.
2. Treasury bills are issued only by State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI manages and services Central Government securities, it does not handle State Government securities. This is a key distinction in the management of public debt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Treasury bills are primarily issued by the Central Government, not State Governments. State Governments may issue other forms of debt instruments, but not treasury bills in the same manner as the Central Government.


**19. With reference to the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), consider the following statements:**

1.  CAR is determined by each individual bank based on its risk assessment.
2. CAR is the amount banks must maintain as their own funds to offset potential losses from non-repayment of loans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While banks do conduct internal risk assessments, the CAR is not determined solely by individual banks.  Regulatory authorities set minimum CAR requirements that banks must meet to ensure financial stability and to protect depositors.

Statement 2 is correct. CAR represents the minimum proportion of a bank's capital (equity and reserves) to its risk-weighted assets.  This serves as a buffer to absorb potential losses from loan defaults or other financial risks.


**20. Consider the following statements about commercial banks in India:**

1. Deposits are considered a liability for commercial banks.
2.  Advances (loans) are considered an asset for commercial banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Deposits represent money that banks owe to depositors, forming a liability on the bank's balance sheet.

Statement 2 is also correct. Advances, or loans given by banks, are considered assets as they represent the bank's claims on borrowers.  These loans generate interest income for the bank.


**21. With reference to factors that reduce the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Increased government expenditure significantly reduces currency crisis risks.
2.  Remittances from Indians abroad contribute to foreign exchange reserves and reduce currency crisis risks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Increased government expenditure, especially if not matched by revenue generation, can actually *increase* the risk of a currency crisis by putting pressure on the balance of payments and the value of the currency.

Statement 2 is correct. Remittances are a significant source of foreign exchange inflow, bolstering the country's reserves and improving its ability to defend against currency fluctuations and external shocks.


**22. Consider the following measures a government might take to prevent the depreciation of its currency:**

1.  Implementing an expansionary monetary policy.
2.  Curbing imports of non-essential goods and promoting exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy, involving increased money supply, can lead to inflation and potentially weaken the currency, making it more prone to depreciation.

Statement 2 is correct.  Curbing imports reduces the demand for foreign currency, while promoting exports increases the supply of foreign currency. This helps to maintain or improve the value of the domestic currency.


**23. Consider the following statements regarding the money multiplier:**

1.  A higher cash reserve ratio (CRR) leads to a higher money multiplier.
2.  Increased banking habits among the population lead to a higher money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A higher CRR reduces the money multiplier because banks have less money available to lend, thus limiting the expansion of credit.

Statement 2 is correct.  Increased banking habits mean more people deposit their money in banks, giving banks more funds to lend, thereby increasing the money multiplier effect.


**24. With reference to actions that might provide immunity to India in a future global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility is essential for immunity.
2.  Reducing dependence on short-term foreign borrowings is crucial.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Full capital account convertibility, while offering benefits, also exposes the economy to greater volatility and susceptibility during global crises.  Restrictions on capital flows can serve as a protective mechanism.

Statement 2 is correct.  Dependence on short-term foreign debt increases vulnerability to sudden capital flight during global crises.  Reducing this dependence strengthens resilience.


**25. Consider the following statements regarding the immediate effect of a large cash withdrawal from a demand deposit account:**

1. It reduces the aggregate money supply by the amount withdrawn.
2. It increases the aggregate money supply by more than the amount withdrawn.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A cash withdrawal directly reduces the money supply by the amount taken out of the banking system.  The money is no longer available for lending or other transactions within the banking system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Cash withdrawals reduce the money supply.  The money multiplier effect works in reverse when cash is withdrawn, reducing the overall money supply.



**26. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, consider the following purposes for which short-term credit support is provided:**

1.  Construction of family houses and setting up village cold storage facilities.
2.  Post-harvest expenses, including transportation and storage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. KCC primarily focuses on short-term credit needs related to agricultural activities.  Long-term investments like house construction or cold storage facilities are typically not covered under KCC.

Statement 2 is correct.  KCC provides credit for various post-harvest expenses, ensuring that farmers can manage their produce effectively and minimize losses.


**27. Consider the following statements regarding financial instruments:**

1. Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note.
2.  Certificates of Deposit are long-term instruments issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to corporations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Commercial paper is a short-term debt instrument issued by corporations to raise funds, typically unsecured.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term debt instruments issued by banks, not the RBI, to corporations or individuals.  They are not typically long-term instruments.


**28. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI primarily involves investments through capital instruments in listed companies.
2. FDI is characterized as a largely non-debt-creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While FDI can involve investments in listed companies, it is not limited to them. FDI can take various forms, including equity investments in unlisted companies, joint ventures, and mergers and acquisitions.

Statement 2 is correct.  FDI is primarily equity-based investment, representing a direct ownership stake in a company, unlike portfolio investment or loans, which create debt obligations.


**29. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the President of India.
2. The RBI Act grants the Governor of the RBI significant powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the Central Government (although technically, the President acts on the advice of the government).

Statement 2 is also correct. The RBI Act, 1934, vests substantial powers in the RBI Governor regarding monetary policy, banking regulation, and the management of the country's financial system.


**30. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. UCBs are directly supervised and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India.
2. UCBs are permitted to issue both equity and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While UCBs had some degree of autonomy historically, they are now increasingly under the direct supervision and regulation of the RBI, especially after amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Statement 2 is also correct. UCBs, like other banks, can issue equity shares to raise capital and preference shares, offering a different class of shares with preferential dividend rights.


**31.  Consider the following factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields:**

1. Actions of the United States Federal Reserve.
2. Inflation and short-term interest rates within India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Global factors, including actions by the US Federal Reserve (like changes in interest rates), significantly impact investor sentiment and capital flows, influencing bond yields in India.

Statement 2 is also correct. Domestic factors, such as inflation and short-term interest rates, directly affect the attractiveness of government bonds, impacting their yields.


**32.  With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), consider the following that can be included:**

1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds.
2.  Global depository receipts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) are a form of debt financing, not FDI.  While they can lead to indirect foreign investment, they do not directly represent ownership or control.

Statement 2 is correct. Global depository receipts (GDRs) represent ownership in a company listed on a foreign stock exchange, fulfilling the criteria for FDI.


**33. Consider the following effects of currency devaluation:**

1. Devaluation necessarily improves the trade balance.
2. Devaluation improves the competitiveness of domestic exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While devaluation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, improving the trade balance is not guaranteed.  Other factors, such as price elasticity of demand and supply, can influence the outcome.

Statement 2 is correct.  Devaluation makes domestic goods cheaper for foreign buyers, increasing their competitiveness in international markets.


**34. With reference to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following:**

1. Inflation-indexing wages contribute to demand-pull inflation.
2.  Rising interest rates contribute to demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Inflation-indexing wages means wages increase with inflation. This increases disposable income, boosting aggregate demand and potentially fueling demand-pull inflation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rising interest rates are a *contractionary* monetary policy tool aimed at reducing demand and controlling inflation.  They counteract demand-pull inflation.


**35.  Consider the following statements regarding India's balance of payments:**

1. The current account records transactions that affect a country's foreign assets and liabilities.
2. The capital account records exports and imports of goods and services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The capital account records transactions that *do* affect a country's foreign assets and liabilities (e.g., foreign investment, loans).  The current account records transactions that *don't* directly affect these assets and liabilities (e.g., trade in goods and services).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The current account, not the capital account, records exports and imports of goods and services, along with other income and transfer payments.


**36. With reference to India's foreign trade, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's foreign trade as a proportion of GDP has remained relatively stable over time.
2.  Leakages from the circular flow of income occur when Indians buy foreign goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's foreign trade as a proportion of GDP has significantly *increased* over time, reflecting greater integration into the global economy.

Statement 2 is correct.  When Indians purchase foreign goods, the money flows out of the domestic economy, representing a leakage from the circular flow of income and reducing aggregate demand.


**37. Consider the following statements regarding the determination of exchange rates:**

1. A nation's commitment to freely convertible currency at a fixed price affects its international transactions.
2. The international monetary system is designed to ensure stability in international transactions by mandating the use of a single global currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A nation's commitment to freely convertible currency (at a fixed or floating rate) significantly influences its trade and financial interactions with the rest of the world.  Confidence in a currency's stability is crucial for international transactions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. There is no single global currency mandated for international transactions.  The international monetary system manages exchange rate fluctuations and facilitates international payments through various mechanisms, but it doesn't enforce a single currency.


**38. With reference to India's balance of payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. A current account deficit is always financed by a net capital outflow.
2. The overall balance of payments deficit is equal to the decrease in official reserves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A current account deficit is financed by a net *inflow* of capital, not outflow.  A country needs to borrow or attract foreign investment to cover the shortfall in its current account.

Statement 2 is correct.  The overall balance of payments deficit reflects the net change in a country's official reserves (foreign exchange holdings).  A deficit implies that the country has used its reserves to finance the shortfall in its current and capital accounts.


**39. Consider the following statements regarding autonomous and accommodating transactions in the BoP:**

1.  Accommodating transactions are made independently of the state of the balance of payments.
2.  Official reserve transactions are considered accommodating transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Autonomous transactions are independent of the BoP's state. Accommodating transactions, on the other hand, are determined *by* the state of the BoP (surplus or deficit).

Statement 2 is correct.  Official reserve transactions (changes in a country's foreign exchange reserves) are the accommodating items in the BoP, adjusting to offset imbalances caused by autonomous transactions.


**40.  With reference to the foreign exchange market, consider the following statements:**

1. The foreign exchange market is a geographically centralized market.
2. The price of one currency in terms of another is known as the exchange rate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The foreign exchange market is a *decentralized* global market, with participants operating across various locations and trading centers.

Statement 2 is correct.  The exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another.  It is a crucial determinant of international trade and capital flows.


**41. Consider the following statements about real and nominal exchange rates:**

1. The real exchange rate measures the relative purchasing power of currencies.
2.  Purchasing power parity (PPP) implies

**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  It primarily aims to provide credit to small and marginal farmers for specific crop cultivation.
2.  A significant objective is to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a government initiative focused on providing funding to micro-units and small enterprises. Its core objective is to foster entrepreneurship and promote financial inclusion among the unorganized sector.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this goal; by providing loans, PMMY aims to integrate small businesses into the formal financial system, thereby improving their access to credit and other financial services.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMMY might indirectly benefit some farmers who are also small business owners, its primary focus is not on agricultural lending.  There are separate government schemes dedicated to providing credit to farmers for specific crops.  The confusion might stem from the fact that many small businesses in rural areas are agricultural-related, but PMMY's scope extends beyond just agriculture.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to the "Government’s Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme" and "Gold Monetization Scheme," consider the following statements:**

1.  A key purpose is to reduce India's dependence on gold imports by mobilizing domestic gold reserves.
2.  These schemes primarily aim to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewellery sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are designed to bring idle gold held by households into the formal financial system.  This helps to reduce reliance on gold imports, as the government can utilize the mobilized gold for various purposes, including meeting its reserve requirements.  Statement 1 correctly identifies this key objective. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While these schemes might indirectly boost investor confidence and subsequently attract some FDI, their primary purpose is not to specifically target FDI in the gold and jewellery sector.  They focus on utilizing domestic resources, not attracting foreign capital.  Attracting FDI is a separate policy goal, pursued through different means. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes the purpose of these schemes.


**3. With reference to Bitcoins, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transactions using Bitcoins are completely anonymous, with neither party revealing their identity.
2.  Central banks of various countries actively monitor and regulate Bitcoin transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Bitcoins operate on a decentralized, blockchain technology. While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous (meaning they are not directly linked to real-world identities), they are not entirely anonymous.  Detailed transaction records exist on the public blockchain, enabling tracing of transactions through their unique addresses.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 is also incorrect. Central banks generally do not directly monitor or regulate Bitcoin transactions.  Bitcoin operates outside of traditional banking systems and national currencies.  While some governments are exploring regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, the current reality is that Bitcoin transactions are not under the direct purview of central banks.  Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**4. With reference to the functions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IMF primarily functions as the private sector lending arm of the World Bank.
2.  A core function is to assist member countries in overcoming balance of payments problems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IMF's primary mandate is to promote international monetary cooperation and financial stability.  It plays a crucial role in assisting member countries facing balance of payments difficulties.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  The IMF and the World Bank are separate institutions, though they often collaborate.  The World Bank focuses on development lending, while the IMF concentrates on macroeconomic stability and financial assistance during crises.  The IMF is not the private sector lending arm of the World Bank; they have distinct functions and structures.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**5. With reference to the World Bank, consider the following statements:**

1.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a constituent part of the World Bank.
2.  The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is one of the institutions that constitutes the World Bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Bank is a group of five international organizations, including IBRD and IDA.  The IMF is a separate international financial institution, distinct from the World Bank.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Statement 2 is correct; the IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) is a key component of the World Bank Group.  It provides loans and financial assistance to middle-income and creditworthy poorer countries for development projects.  The confusion may arise from the close collaboration between these two institutions, but they are organizationally distinct.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A primary purpose of SFBs is to encourage young entrepreneurs to establish businesses, particularly in rural areas.
2.  SFBs are primarily aimed at supplying credit to small business units and small and marginal farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India were established to cater to the financial needs of underserved segments of the population.  This includes providing credit to small businesses and small and marginal farmers. Statement 2 correctly reflects this.  While not their primary focus, SFBs can indirectly contribute to encouraging entrepreneurship, especially in rural areas, by making credit more accessible.  Therefore, statement 1 is also partially correct, though the emphasis is on credit provision. Both statements align with the overall goals of SFBs, although their primary focus is clearly on credit to underserved segments.


**7. With reference to the "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1.  MDR is an incentive offered by the government to merchants for promoting digital payments.
2.  MDR represents the charge levied on a merchant by a bank for accepting payments through debit cards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a fee that banks charge merchants for processing payments made through debit or credit cards.  Statement 2 correctly defines this.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the government might offer incentives to encourage digital transactions, the MDR itself is not a government incentive; it's a fee charged by banks to cover their processing costs.  The potential for confusion arises because the government's promotion of digital payments aims to reduce the burden of MDR on merchants through various subsidies or schemes.  However, the MDR itself remains a bank charge. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**8. With reference to "legal tender money," consider the following statements:**

1.  Legal tender money refers to metallic money in circulation within a country.
2.  It is money that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of a debt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Legal tender money is currency that a creditor must accept as payment for a debt. This is the legal definition.  Statement 2 correctly captures this.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While metallic money can be legal tender, the definition of legal tender encompasses more than just metallic currency.  It includes banknotes and coins issued by the central bank, which are not necessarily metallic.  The limitation to metallic money is a misconception. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately defines legal tender money.


**9. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) functions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI manages and services securities issued by both the Central and State Governments.
2.  The RBI issues Treasury bills on behalf of the State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RBI's role is primarily focused on managing the Central Government's securities.  While it might provide certain services related to State Government securities, it does not directly manage or service them to the same extent. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The issuance of Treasury bills is a function of the government, not the RBI.  The RBI might play a role in the process, but it doesn't directly issue Treasury bills for State Governments. The RBI's involvement is primarily in the management and operation of the financial system, not in the direct issuance of State Government debt instruments.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely accurate.


**10. With reference to factors contributing to reducing the risk of a currency crisis in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Increasing government expenditure is a significant contributor to mitigating currency crisis risks.
2. Remittances from Indians abroad and foreign currency earnings from the IT sector are crucial factors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A currency crisis can be triggered by various factors, including a large current account deficit, low foreign exchange reserves, and speculative attacks on the currency.  Factors that strengthen a country's external position, such as robust foreign exchange inflows, can help mitigate these risks.  Statement 2 correctly points out that remittances from Indians abroad and foreign currency earnings from the IT sector significantly increase foreign exchange reserves, thus acting as a buffer against currency crises.  Statement 1 is incorrect. Increasing government expenditure, particularly if it is not matched by increased revenue or productivity gains, can actually exacerbate a currency crisis by widening the fiscal deficit and putting pressure on the currency.  Increased government spending may lead to higher imports and thus, deplete foreign exchange reserves. Therefore, only statement 2 is a valid contributor to reducing currency crisis risk.


**11. With reference to measures taken by the Government/RBI to halt a decline in the Indian rupee, consider the following statements:**

1.  Following an expansionary monetary policy is a common and effective measure.
2.  Curbing imports of non-essential goods and promoting exports are effective approaches.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

When a currency depreciates, measures are taken to improve the balance of payments and stabilize the exchange rate.  Statement 2 accurately describes effective strategies: reducing imports (particularly non-essential ones) decreases the demand for foreign currency, while promoting exports increases the supply of foreign currency, both contributing to exchange rate stability.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  An expansionary monetary policy, which involves increasing money supply, tends to decrease interest rates and can actually weaken the currency further, making it less attractive to foreign investors.  Contractionary monetary policies are typically employed during currency crises to stabilize the exchange rate. Therefore, only statement 2 represents effective measures.


**12. With reference to the money multiplier in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) leads to an increase in the money multiplier.
2.  Increased banking habits among the population contribute to a higher money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The money multiplier reflects the extent to which an initial injection of money into the banking system can lead to a larger expansion of the overall money supply.  Statement 2 is correct.  Higher banking habits mean a greater proportion of money is deposited in banks, which banks can then lend out, thereby increasing the money multiplier effect.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  An increase in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), which is the percentage of deposits banks are required to maintain in liquid assets, actually reduces the money multiplier.  This is because a higher SLR reduces the amount of money banks can lend out.  Therefore, only statement 2 correctly describes a factor that increases the money multiplier.


**13.  With reference to actions/policies that could provide immunity to India in another global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1. Maintaining full capital account convertibility is a crucial measure to ensure immunity.
2. Reducing dependence on short-term foreign borrowings is a key strategy to mitigate risks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Global financial crises often involve sudden capital flight and exchange rate volatility.  Statement 2 correctly identifies a vital strategy: reducing reliance on short-term foreign borrowing makes a country less vulnerable to sudden capital outflows during crises.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While capital account convertibility can offer certain benefits, full convertibility can also make a country more susceptible to speculative attacks and capital flight during a crisis.  Restricting short-term capital flows can help prevent such rapid outflows.  Therefore, only statement 2 represents a prudent strategy for mitigating risks in a global financial crisis.


**14. With reference to the immediate effect of withdrawing cash from a demand deposit account, consider the following statements:**

1.  The aggregate money supply in the economy decreases by the exact amount withdrawn.
2.  The aggregate money supply increases by more than the amount withdrawn due to the money multiplier effect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

When an individual withdraws cash from a demand deposit account, the money supply is directly reduced by that amount.  The money was already counted within the M1 money supply (currency with the public + demand deposits with banks).  The withdrawal simply transfers this money from a demand deposit to currency with the public, resulting in a direct reduction in demand deposits and an increase in currency with the public.  The net effect is no change in the money supply.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect. The money multiplier effect describes how an initial injection of money into the banking system can lead to a *larger* expansion of the money supply.  However, a withdrawal represents a contraction, not an injection.  It reduces the money supply by the amount withdrawn, not increasing it.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**15. With reference to the purposes of short-term credit support under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  KCC provides funds for the construction of family houses and setting up village cold storage facilities.
2.  KCC offers working capital for farm asset maintenance and post-harvest expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme primarily aims to provide short-term credit to farmers for their agricultural needs.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this.  It covers expenses such as working capital for maintaining farm assets and post-harvest activities.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  KCC credit is typically for operational and short-term needs related to cultivation and harvesting.  Long-term investments like house construction or setting up cold storage facilities are usually funded through different government schemes or private loans.  The KCC focuses on short-term credit for immediate agricultural requirements.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**16. With reference to "Commercial Paper," "Certificate of Deposit," "Call money," and "Zero coupon Bonds" in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Call money is a short-term instrument used primarily for interbank transactions.
2.  Certificate of Deposit is a long-term instrument issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to corporations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Call money is a short-term borrowing instrument used mainly in the interbank market for managing short-term liquidity needs.  Statement 1 is therefore correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term borrowing instruments issued by banks and other financial institutions, not by the RBI. They are not long term instruments.  They are typically issued to individuals and corporations, not specifically to corporations only.  The confusion might stem from the fact that the RBI regulates the issuance of CDs, but it doesn't issue them itself. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**17. With reference to the major characteristics of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI primarily involves investments through capital instruments essentially in a listed company.
2. FDI is largely a non-debt creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) represents long-term investments made by foreign entities to gain control or influence over domestic businesses.  Statement 2 correctly captures this; FDI is primarily equity investment, not debt financing.  It involves acquiring ownership stakes in companies, not simply lending money.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While FDI can involve investments in listed companies, it is not limited to them.  FDI can also involve setting up new businesses, greenfield investments, or acquiring stakes in unlisted companies.  FDI is broader than investments in listed companies. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes a major characteristic of FDI.


**18. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the Parliament of India.
2.  The RBI Act is the primary source of the RBI Governor's authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Governor of the RBI is appointed by the Central Government (not the Parliament).  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The RBI's powers and functions are defined by the RBI Act, 1934.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct; the RBI Governor's authority is derived from the provisions of the RBI Act.  The confusion might arise from the parliamentary oversight of the RBI's activities, but the appointment power rests with the executive branch of the government.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**19. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  UCBs are supervised and regulated by local boards set up by the State Governments.
2.  An amendment to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, brought UCBs under its purview.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not local boards set up by State Governments.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, was amended to include UCBs under its purview, strengthening regulatory oversight.  Statement 2 is correct.  The amendment aimed to improve the stability and soundness of the UCB sector.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**20. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following statements:**

1.  Actions of the United States Federal Reserve have a negligible impact on Indian bond yields.
2.  Inflation and short-term interest rates significantly influence Indian Government Bond Yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Government bond yields reflect the return investors expect on government debt.  Statement 2 is correct.  Inflation erodes the real value of bond returns, leading to higher yields when inflation is high.  Short-term interest rates influence investor expectations for future returns, also affecting bond yields.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  Actions of the US Federal Reserve, particularly changes in US interest rates, can impact global capital flows and influence investor sentiment towards emerging market bonds like Indian government bonds.  This can affect the demand and supply of Indian government bonds, hence influencing their yields. Therefore, only statement 2 is a significant factor.


**21. With reference to what can be included in Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds are a form of FDI.
2.  Non-resident external deposits are considered FDI.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) involves long-term investments made by foreign entities to gain control or influence over domestic businesses.  Statement 1 is incorrect. Foreign currency convertible bonds are debt instruments, not equity investments. FDI is primarily equity based.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Non-resident external deposits are short-term investments, not FDI which denotes long-term investments.  FDI implies a degree of control or management influence, which is absent in short-term deposits.  Therefore, neither statement accurately represents a component of FDI.


**22. With reference to the effects of currency devaluation, consider the following statements:**

1. Devaluation necessarily improves the trade balance.
2. Devaluation enhances the competitiveness of domestic exports in foreign markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Currency devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper and imports more expensive.  Statement 2 is correct; devaluation increases the price competitiveness of domestic goods in the international market, potentially boosting exports.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While devaluation is intended to improve the trade balance, the actual effect is not guaranteed.  The success depends on several factors, including the price elasticity of demand for imports and exports, as well as other economic conditions.  A devaluation might not always lead to an immediate improvement in the trade balance.  Therefore, only statement 2 is a certain consequence of devaluation.


**23. With reference to factors that can cause or increase demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. Rising interest rates are a major cause of demand-pull inflation.
2. Expansionary policies and fiscal stimulus increase aggregate demand, leading to demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation arises when aggregate demand exceeds the economy's capacity to produce goods and services.  Statement 2 correctly identifies key factors: expansionary policies (like increased government spending or lower taxes) and fiscal stimulus (government spending to boost the economy) directly increase aggregate demand, putting upward pressure on prices.  Statement 1 is incorrect. Rising interest rates are typically used to *combat* inflation, not cause it.  Higher interest rates reduce borrowing and investment, thereby cooling down aggregate demand and curbing inflationary pressures.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes factors that contribute to demand-pull inflation.



**1. With reference to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and India's economic standing, consider the following statements:**

1.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates are calculated by comparing prices of identical baskets of goods and services across different nations, adjusting for differences in cost of living.
2.  Based on PPP calculations, India consistently ranks among the top ten largest economies globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of a standardized basket of goods and services in different countries. This method accounts for variations in purchasing power across nations, offering a more nuanced comparison of economic size than nominal exchange rates.  It provides a more realistic picture of the relative living standards and economic output in different countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's economy is large, its ranking among the top ten largest economies globally based on PPP is not consistently maintained across all sources and years.  The ranking fluctuates depending on the methodology used, the specific basket of goods and services considered, and the data used in the calculations.  Different organizations may employ varying methodologies, leading to discrepancies in rankings.  Furthermore, while India's PPP-adjusted GDP is significant, it doesn't always place it within the top ten.  The claim needs to be more precise and supported by specific data from a reliable source.  The relative rankings of countries based on PPP are subject to constant revision as economic data is updated.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccuracy of statement 2.  A complete understanding of PPP requires recognizing both its strengths in comparing living standards and its limitations in providing a completely stable, universally accepted ranking of global economies.


**2. With reference to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPI places a greater emphasis on food items than the WPI, reflecting the higher proportion of household expenditure dedicated to food in India.
2. The WPI excludes services, while the CPI includes them, leading to potential differences in inflation measurement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  Statement 1 accurately reflects the difference in the weighting of food items between the CPI and WPI.  The CPI, designed to measure the cost of living for consumers, assigns a higher weight to food because food constitutes a larger portion of household budgets, especially in developing economies like India.  The WPI, on the other hand, focuses on prices at the wholesale level and has a different weighting scheme.

Statement 2 is also accurate. The WPI traditionally concentrates on the prices of goods traded in wholesale markets and generally excludes services.  This is a key distinction from the CPI, which includes services, a significant component of consumer spending in many modern economies.  The exclusion of services in the WPI can lead to a different inflation picture compared to the CPI, particularly in economies where the service sector is growing rapidly.  This difference in scope impacts the overall inflation measurement and policy implications.  Therefore, policymakers need to consider both indices to gain a comprehensive view of inflation pressures.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses both CPI and WPI data, but the CPI is increasingly viewed as the more relevant measure of inflation for monetary policy decisions.


**3. With reference to the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in NEER signifies an appreciation of the Indian rupee against a basket of major currencies.
2. A rise in REER indicates improved trade competitiveness for Indian businesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NEER is an index that measures the value of a country's currency relative to a weighted average of other currencies.  An increase in the NEER indicates that the domestic currency (in this case, the Indian Rupee) has appreciated, meaning it takes more units of foreign currencies to buy one unit of the Rupee. This appreciation occurs due to factors such as increased demand for the Rupee in foreign exchange markets, or due to monetary policies aimed at strengthening the currency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The REER adjusts the NEER for inflation differentials between the domestic economy and its trading partners.  While a higher REER might *seem* to suggest improved competitiveness (because it suggests a relatively cheaper currency), it actually indicates the opposite. A rise in the REER implies that the domestic currency has become more expensive relative to other currencies, considering the inflation rates. This makes exports less competitive and imports more attractive, potentially leading to a worsening trade balance.  Therefore, a lower REER is generally associated with improved trade competitiveness.  The REER provides a more accurate picture of a country's export competitiveness than the NEER alone.


**4.  With reference to the Indian economy's response to global financial crises, consider the following statements:**

1. Reducing reliance on short-term foreign borrowings enhances resilience to external shocks.
2. Maintaining full capital account convertibility acts as a buffer against global financial crises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Short-term foreign borrowings are vulnerable to sudden shifts in global investor sentiment.  During financial crises, foreign investors often withdraw funds rapidly from emerging markets, leading to currency depreciation and financial instability.  Reducing reliance on these types of borrowings by focusing on longer-term financing strategies strengthens a country's ability to withstand such shocks.  Diversifying funding sources and having sufficient foreign exchange reserves also contributes to this resilience.  This approach is crucial for emerging economies like India that are susceptible to capital flight during global financial turmoil.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While capital account convertibility allows for free flow of capital, it also increases vulnerability to external shocks.  During a global crisis, large capital outflows can destabilize the domestic financial system, leading to currency depreciation and economic contraction.  Full capital account convertibility can expose an economy to speculative attacks and sudden shifts in investor sentiment.  While it offers benefits in terms of integration with the global financial system, managing the risks associated with it during times of global stress is essential.  A more cautious approach, involving selective liberalization of capital flows, may be a more prudent strategy for managing vulnerability during global financial crises.  Therefore, while full convertibility has advantages, it's not a guaranteed buffer against crises.


**5. With reference to the components of a commercial bank's assets in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Advances (loans given to customers) form a significant portion of a commercial bank's assets.
2. Deposits held by customers constitute a major asset for commercial banks.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Advances, which represent loans extended to individuals and businesses, are a primary component of a commercial bank's asset portfolio.  These loans generate interest income for the bank, and the loan amounts are assets held by the bank until repaid.  The management of the loan portfolio, including credit risk assessment, is a crucial aspect of a bank's operations and profitability.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Deposits are a *liability* for a commercial bank, not an asset.  The money deposited by customers belongs to the depositors and represents an obligation for the bank to repay the funds upon demand or as per the terms of the deposit.  While banks use these deposits to generate income through lending and investment, the deposits themselves are not considered assets of the bank.  Instead, they form the basis for the bank's lending operations.  The bank's assets are the investments and loans made using these deposits.  Therefore, a fundamental understanding of banking requires differentiating between assets and liabilities.


**6. With reference to measures taken by the Indian government or RBI to curb the slide of the Indian Rupee, consider the following statements:**

1.  Curbing imports of non-essential goods and promoting exports helps to improve the trade balance and support the Rupee.
2.  Easing conditions for external commercial borrowing (ECB) inflows typically strengthens the Rupee.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A widening trade deficit (imports exceeding exports) puts downward pressure on a country's currency.  Curbing non-essential imports reduces the demand for foreign currency (in this case, primarily the US dollar), thus helping to support the Rupee.  Simultaneously, promoting exports increases the supply of foreign currency, further bolstering the Rupee's value.  This strategy is a common tool used by central banks and governments to manage exchange rates.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  Easing conditions for ECBs might seem to help since it increases the inflow of foreign currency. However, increased ECBs can also lead to increased external debt, which carries its own risks.  Moreover, if the increased ECBs are primarily used for consumption rather than investment in productive sectors, it could worsen the current account deficit, putting further pressure on the Rupee.  Therefore, while ECBs can provide short-term support, they are not a guaranteed or sustainable solution for managing exchange rate fluctuations.  The impact of ECBs on the Rupee’s value depends on various factors, including the purpose for which the borrowed funds are used, and the overall state of the global economy.  RBI often uses a more nuanced approach involving a combination of measures to manage the Rupee's exchange rate.


**7. With reference to the money multiplier in an economy, consider the following statements:**

1. An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) leads to a decrease in the money multiplier.
2. Increased banking habits among the population enhance the money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The money multiplier represents the potential expansion of the money supply resulting from an initial injection of new money into the banking system.  Statement 1 accurately describes the inverse relationship between the CRR and the money multiplier.  The CRR is the percentage of deposits that banks are required to hold in reserve with the central bank. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thus lowering the money multiplier.  A lower CRR allows banks to lend more, potentially increasing the money supply.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Increased banking habits mean a larger portion of the public's money is held in bank accounts rather than as cash.  This increases the amount of money that banks can lend, thereby increasing the money multiplier.  The money multiplier is directly related to the amount of money held in the banking system, available for lending.  A higher proportion of money in bank accounts translates to a larger potential for money supply expansion through lending.  Therefore, both the CRR and banking habits play a significant role in determining the money multiplier's magnitude.


**8. With reference to the immediate effect of cash withdrawal from a demand deposit account on aggregate money supply, consider the following statements:**

1.  Withdrawing Rs. 1,00,000 in cash reduces the aggregate money supply by exactly Rs. 1,00,000.
2.  The impact on aggregate money supply is dependent on the bank's lending behavior after the withdrawal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the immediate effect of withdrawing Rs. 1,00,000 in cash is a reduction in the bank's reserves, it doesn't necessarily reduce the aggregate money supply by the exact same amount.  The aggregate money supply is a broader measure encompassing currency in circulation and various forms of money held in the banking system.  The actual impact depends on subsequent actions within the banking system and the money multiplier effect.

Statement 2 is correct.  The withdrawal reduces the bank's reserves, limiting its ability to lend.  This affects the money multiplier, which determines the potential expansion of the money supply from an initial deposit.  If the bank reduces its lending in response to the withdrawal, the impact on the aggregate money supply will be more significant. However, if the bank maintains its lending rate by drawing down other reserves, the reduction in aggregate money supply could be less than Rs. 1,00,000.  The overall impact is thus contingent on the bank's subsequent lending decisions and the interplay of various factors within the banking system and economy.  The money multiplier effect signifies that the initial reduction of Rs. 1,00,000 can potentially have a larger impact on the money supply, but the precise impact is not straightforward and depends on other economic factors.



**9. With reference to the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme's purposes, consider the following statements:**

1.  The KCC scheme provides short-term credit for purchasing expensive farm equipment like tractors.
2.  The scheme includes credit for meeting the consumption needs of farming households.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The KCC scheme aims to provide timely and adequate credit support to farmers for various agricultural activities. Statement 1 is correct because the scheme does indeed encompass short-term credit for purchasing farm equipment and machinery, which contributes to improving agricultural productivity and efficiency.  This credit facility is crucial for small and marginal farmers who may lack access to traditional credit sources.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The KCC scheme recognizes the multifaceted needs of farming households.  It extends credit not just for agricultural inputs and operations but also for meeting the consumption requirements of the farmer's family.  This provision acknowledges the fact that farmers often face financial constraints affecting their household's basic needs.  Providing credit for consumption alongside agricultural credit ensures that farmers can manage both their farm operations and their household expenses effectively.  The scheme is designed to ensure the holistic financial well-being of farming families. Therefore, the KCC scheme's objectives cover a broad range of farming-related needs.


**10. With reference to Commercial Paper, Certificates of Deposit, Call Money, and Zero Coupon Bonds in the Indian financial market, consider the following statements:**

1. Commercial Paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by large corporations.
2. Certificates of Deposit are long-term instruments issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to corporations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Commercial Paper (CP) is indeed a short-term, unsecured promissory note.  It's a money market instrument used by large and creditworthy corporations to raise short-term funds.  The unsecured nature of CP means it does not involve any collateral, relying solely on the borrower's creditworthiness.  The short maturity period makes it a liquid instrument, suitable for bridging short-term financing needs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term debt instruments issued by banks, not the RBI, to corporations.  They are typically offered by banks to corporations seeking to park their surplus funds for a short period and earn interest.  While the RBI plays a role in regulating the money market, it does not directly issue CDs to corporations.  The RBI's role is primarily in monetary policy and regulation of financial institutions.  CDs are issued by commercial banks to attract short-term deposits and manage their liquidity.  They are negotiable instruments and can be traded in the money market.  Therefore, the issuer and the maturity period of CDs are both different from what’s stated in the statement.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's primary concern regarding RCEP was the potential for increased imports from China, exacerbating its existing trade deficit.
2.  The RCEP agreement included robust provisions for "Rules of Origin," effectively preventing the circumvention of tariffs through product rerouting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's withdrawal from RCEP stemmed significantly from concerns about increased imports from China, leading to a widening trade deficit.  The lack of sufficient safeguards against dumping of Chinese goods was a major point of contention.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A key reason for India's hesitation was the perceived inadequacy of the RCEP agreement's "Rules of Origin."  India feared that this weakness would allow countries like China to circumvent tariffs by routing goods through other RCEP members.  This would have negated any potential benefits of the agreement for India.  The absence of strong Rules of Origin was a significant factor in India's decision not to join RCEP.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the World Trade Organization (WTO):**

1.  The WTO's Dispute Settlement System is characterized by its rapid and efficient resolution of trade disputes, ensuring minimal disruption to global commerce.
2.  The WTO encourages trade among member countries primarily through the reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers, thereby facilitating greater market access.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the WTO aims for efficient dispute resolution, the system has faced criticism for lengthy processes and impasses.  The Appellate Body, crucial for resolving appeals, faced significant challenges, hindering swift resolutions. This has led to concerns about the efficacy of the dispute settlement mechanism.

Statement 2 is correct. A core function of the WTO is to promote international trade by reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers. This approach aims to create a more level playing field for member countries and facilitate increased trade flows. The WTO agreements are built around this principle of liberalization and market access.


**3. With reference to India's Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's FTAs have consistently resulted in a larger increase in exports compared to imports, contributing to a significant improvement in its trade balance.
2.  India's FTA strategy has primarily focused on partnerships with Asian countries, with a greater emphasis on trade in goods rather than services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While FTAs have increased trade volume with partner countries, the impact on India's trade balance has been mixed.  In many cases, imports have increased more significantly than exports, potentially due to factors like India's relatively high tariffs before the agreements.  This has led to concerns about the net benefit of some FTAs.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's FTA approach has historically prioritized partnerships with Asian nations, primarily focusing on trade in goods.  While there's been a growing emphasis on services in recent agreements, the initial focus was predominantly on goods-based trade relationships within the Asian region.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA):**

1.  ECTA provides India with preferential market access on 100% of Australia's tariff lines.
2.  ECTA covers areas such as trade in goods, services, intellectual property rights (IPRs), and dispute settlement mechanisms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A key benefit for India under ECTA is preferential market access to 100% of Australia's tariff lines. This broad access significantly enhances the competitiveness of Indian exports to the Australian market.

Statement 2 is correct. ECTA is a comprehensive agreement encompassing various aspects of economic cooperation, including trade in goods and services, rules of origin, technical barriers to trade (TBT), sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, and a framework for dispute resolution.  Intellectual property rights are also an integral part of the agreement.


**5. With reference to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IMF's primary objective is to provide long-term, concessional loans to developing countries for specific development projects.
2.  The World Bank's lending activities are primarily focused on policy reforms and do not extend to financing specific projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMF's core mandate is to promote international monetary cooperation and financial stability, primarily through short-term loans aimed at addressing balance of payments crises.  These loans are often conditional upon policy reforms.  Long-term concessional loans for specific projects are primarily the domain of the World Bank.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The World Bank, particularly the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), provides loans for both policy reforms and specific development projects.  While policy-based lending is a component of its operations, a significant portion of its lending is project-specific, aimed at infrastructure development, education, and other areas.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural sector:**

1.  India's export basket is heavily dominated by value-added processed agricultural products, reflecting a strong focus on higher-value exports.
2.  Lengthy and cumbersome documentation procedures at ports pose a significant challenge to Indian exporters of perishable agricultural goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A significant challenge for India's agricultural exports is the dominance of raw or minimally processed products in its export basket.  While there is potential for value addition, this has not yet been fully realized, limiting the sector's competitiveness in global markets.

Statement 2 is correct.  Exporters of perishable agricultural goods consistently cite lengthy and complex documentation procedures at Indian ports as a major obstacle. This delays exports and increases costs, significantly impacting the competitiveness of these products in international markets.  Streamlining these procedures is crucial for boosting agricultural exports.


**7. With reference to the "Open Access" policy in India's electricity sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Electricity Act of 2003 mandates open access to transmission and distribution systems for all consumers, irrespective of their category.
2.  The Cross-Subsidy (CS) surcharge is intended to ensure that the benefits of open access are equitably distributed among all consumer categories, preventing disproportionate cost increases for domestic and agricultural consumers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Electricity Act of 2003 promotes open access, it doesn't mandate it for all consumers.  Open access is generally available to larger industrial consumers, while its extension to households remains a work in progress. The policy aims for a gradual expansion of open access.

Statement 2 is correct. The CS surcharge aims to mitigate the potential impact of open access on domestic and agricultural consumers.  Since these consumers often benefit from cross-subsidies (paying lower tariffs than commercial consumers), the surcharge prevents the distribution licensee from passing on the loss of cross-subsidy revenue to these groups.  The goal is to maintain affordable electricity prices for them while allowing for greater competition in the market.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs):**

1.  TRIMs prohibits all forms of investment measures by member countries, regardless of their impact on trade.
2.  TRIMs aims to ensure fair and non-discriminatory treatment of investments in all WTO member countries, preventing trade-distorting measures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. TRIMs doesn't prohibit all investment measures.  It focuses on those measures that are considered trade-distorting, meaning they negatively impact international trade flows.  Some investment measures are permissible, while others are prohibited under the agreement.

Statement 2 is correct.  The fundamental objective of TRIMs is to create a level playing field for investments, ensuring that all investors are treated fairly and without discrimination based on their nationality.  The agreement aims to prevent the use of investment measures that distort trade patterns or create unfair advantages for domestic investors.  This is in line with the broader WTO principles of non-discrimination.


**9. With reference to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), consider the following statements:**

1.  GATS mandates the deregulation and privatization of all service sectors in member countries.
2.  GATS requires governments to publish relevant laws and regulations and establish enquiry points to enhance transparency in the services sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GATS does *not* require the deregulation or privatization of all service sectors.  Member countries retain significant autonomy in deciding which services to liberalize and to what extent.  The agreement focuses on creating a framework for liberalization, not on mandating specific policy choices.

Statement 2 is correct.  GATS emphasizes transparency by requiring governments to publish their relevant laws and regulations and establish enquiry points. This allows foreign service providers to understand the regulatory environment and facilitates greater market access for them.  This commitment to transparency is a key aspect of the GATS framework.


**10. Consider the following statements about the "Amrit Kaal" vision outlined by the Prime Minister of India:**

1.  One of the five commitments ("Panch Pran") for the Amrit Kaal is to achieve 100% literacy rate within the next 25 years.
2.  The Amrit Kaal refers to the 25-year period leading up to India's 100th year of independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Amrit Kaal vision emphasizes development and progress, achieving 100% literacy is not explicitly listed as one of the "Panch Pran" (five commitments).  The five commitments focus on broader goals like a developed India, getting rid of colonial-era mindsets, and national unity.

Statement 2 is correct. The Amrit Kaal represents the 25-year period from India's 75th year of independence to its 100th year, serving as a long-term vision for the nation's development trajectory.  This period signifies a strategic roadmap for India's future growth and progress.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on polity and governance aspects related to economic policies, international trade, and institutional roles.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The New Economic Policy (NEP) of 1991 primarily focused on short-term stabilization measures to address the balance of payments crisis, with long-term structural reforms playing a secondary role.
2.  The NEP's liberalization component involved the complete deregulation of all industrial sectors, eliminating all forms of industrial licensing and price controls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NEP did include immediate stabilization measures to address the balance of payments crisis (such as devaluation of the rupee and fiscal austerity), a significant and arguably more important component was the introduction of long-term structural reforms aimed at improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the Indian economy.  These included deregulation, privatization, and globalization measures.  The short-term and long-term aspects were intertwined and equally crucial.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NEP's liberalization did significantly reduce industrial licensing and price controls, but it did not eliminate them entirely.  Certain sectors, particularly those considered strategically important or involving hazardous materials, remained subject to some degree of regulation.  The extent of deregulation varied across sectors.  The statement oversimplifies the nuanced approach to liberalization adopted in the NEP.


**2. With reference to India's participation in the World Trade Organization (WTO), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's proposal for WTO reforms emphasizes the preservation of the multilateral trading system's core values while addressing development concerns and resolving impasses in the dispute settlement system.
2.  India's engagement with the WTO has consistently prioritized bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) over multilateral agreements, reflecting a shift away from the principles of multilateralism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's position in the WTO reflects a commitment to a rules-based multilateral trading system.  Its proposals for reform consistently highlight the need to safeguard the interests of developing countries, improve the dispute settlement mechanism, and ensure that the WTO's rules promote inclusive growth. This reflects a commitment to multilateralism, not a rejection of it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India has actively pursued bilateral FTAs as a component of its trade and foreign policy, this does not signify a rejection of multilateral agreements.  India remains a strong advocate for and active participant in multilateral trade negotiations under the WTO framework.  The pursuit of bilateral FTAs complements, rather than replaces, India's commitment to multilateralism.  Bilateral agreements can help to address specific trade issues and deepen economic relationships with individual partners, while multilateral agreements provide a broader framework for global trade governance.


**3. With reference to the impact of economic reforms in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The post-1991 reforms led to a significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign exchange reserves, indicating a successful integration into the global economy.
2.  The reforms resulted in a balanced growth across all sectors of the Indian economy, with agriculture, industry, and services experiencing similar rates of growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The economic reforms initiated in 1991 did lead to a substantial increase in FDI inflows and a significant expansion of India's foreign exchange reserves. This reflects increased global confidence in the Indian economy and its integration into the global financial system.  However, it's important to note that the growth wasn't entirely uniform or without challenges.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The growth experienced after the reforms was not evenly distributed across all sectors. While the service sector experienced rapid growth, the agricultural sector's growth rate remained relatively stagnant or even declined in some periods.  Industrial growth also experienced some slowdown due to factors like cheaper imports and infrastructure bottlenecks. The reforms had a disproportionate impact, highlighting the uneven development across sectors.


**4. With reference to India's balance of payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1.  A current account deficit is always financed by a net capital inflow, reflecting the need for external financing to cover excess spending abroad.
2.  The overall balance of payments surplus or deficit is determined solely by the balance of autonomous transactions (above-the-line items), excluding accommodating transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A current account deficit signifies that a country's spending on imports of goods and services exceeds its earnings from exports. This necessitates financing from external sources, typically through capital inflows (foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, loans, etc.).  The deficit in the current account must be offset by a surplus in the capital account to maintain overall balance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The overall BoP balance (surplus or deficit) is not determined solely by autonomous transactions.  Accommodating transactions, such as official reserve transactions (changes in a country's foreign exchange reserves), play a crucial role in adjusting the balance. These transactions are undertaken by monetary authorities to offset imbalances arising from autonomous transactions.  The overall BoP always balances, with accommodating transactions ensuring this balance.  The inclusion or exclusion of accommodating transactions significantly alters the interpretation of the BoP's condition.


**5. With reference to the role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's primary function is to regulate commercial banks and other financial institutions, ensuring the stability and soundness of the financial system.
2.  The RBI's role in managing government debt includes servicing both central and state government securities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RBI's core mandate includes maintaining the stability of the financial system. This involves regulating and supervising commercial banks, managing monetary policy, and overseeing the payment system.  These functions are critical for ensuring the health of the financial sector and preventing crises.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI manages and services the debt of the central government (Government of India securities), but it does not directly manage or service the debt of state governments.  State governments manage their own debt independently, although the RBI may play an indirect role through its broader oversight of the financial system.  The statement incorrectly attributes a responsibility to the RBI that it does not hold.


**6. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Investment in education is the sole determinant of a nation's human capital, with other factors such as health and on-the-job training playing a negligible role.
2.  Expenditure on health is a crucial source of human capital formation because it enhances the productivity and availability of the labor force.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While investment in education is a vital component of human capital formation, it is not the only factor. Other investments, such as those in health, on-the-job training, and information, also significantly contribute to the development of human capital.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate view of the multifaceted nature of human capital development.

Statement 2 is correct.  Health expenditure is directly linked to human capital formation. A healthy workforce is more productive, and access to healthcare reduces absenteeism and improves overall labor force participation.  Investing in preventive and curative healthcare is therefore a crucial investment in human capital.  The statement accurately highlights the connection between health and productivity.


**7. With reference to the impact of globalization on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Globalization has led to increased economic disparities within India, with benefits disproportionately accruing to high-income groups.
2.  Globalization has resulted in a uniform and balanced growth across all sectors of the Indian economy, with no significant negative consequences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While globalization has brought numerous benefits to India, it has also contributed to increased income inequality. The gains from globalization have not been evenly distributed, with high-income groups and certain sectors benefiting disproportionately. This has exacerbated existing inequalities and raised concerns about social justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The impact of globalization on the Indian economy has not been uniform.  While some sectors have experienced rapid growth, others have faced challenges due to increased competition and the need for structural adjustments.  Globalization has had both positive and negative consequences, and its impact has been uneven across different regions and groups within India. The statement ignores the complexities and uneven distribution of the impacts of globalization.


**8. With reference to the measures taken by the Indian government to address economic challenges in the late 1980s and early 1990s, consider the following statements:**

1.  The government's decision to borrow from international financial institutions like the World Bank and IMF was primarily driven by the need to address a severe balance of payments crisis.
2.  The structural adjustment programs implemented as a condition for receiving loans did not lead to any negative consequences for the Indian economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The severe balance of payments crisis that India faced in the early 1990s necessitated borrowing from international financial institutions. The crisis was characterized by declining foreign exchange reserves, growing imports, and high inflation, making external borrowing crucial for stabilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The structural adjustment programs (SAPs) implemented as a condition for receiving loans from international institutions did lead to some negative consequences for the Indian economy. While the reforms ultimately contributed to long-term growth, they also led to short-term challenges such as job losses in some sectors, increased inequality, and social unrest in certain areas. The statement ignores the significant socio-economic costs that accompanied the structural reforms.  The simplification of the statement ignores the complex and multi-faceted impact of the SAPs.


**9.  With reference to the Indian power sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The power sector reforms aimed at increased private sector participation led to improved efficiency and reliability of power supply across the country.
2.  The hike in power tariffs following the reforms has had a negligible impact on small-scale industries such as powerlooms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While power sector reforms did aim to increase private sector participation, the results in terms of improved efficiency and reliability have been mixed.  Many challenges remain, including inadequate infrastructure, distribution losses, and regulatory hurdles. The statement oversimplifies the complex reality of power sector reforms in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The hike in power tariffs following the reforms has had a significant negative impact on small-scale industries like powerlooms, which are highly energy-intensive.  Increased electricity costs have severely affected the profitability and viability of these industries, leading to job losses and economic hardship.  The statement ignores a major consequence of the reforms for a vital sector of the Indian economy.


**10. With reference to the Indian public sector undertakings (PSUs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The privatization of loss-making PSUs is always economically beneficial, regardless of the social and employment consequences.
2. The government's role in the Indian economy should be limited to sectors where the private sector cannot operate efficiently.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While privatization can improve efficiency in some cases, it is not always economically beneficial, especially when it leads to job losses and social disruption without adequate mitigation measures.  A balanced approach considering economic efficiency and social impact is needed.  The statement presents a simplistic view that ignores the social costs of privatization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The government's role in the economy should not be restricted solely to areas where the private sector is inefficient.  The state plays a crucial role in providing essential public services, regulating markets, and addressing market failures, even in sectors where private sector participation is possible.  The statement provides an overly narrow view of the government's role.  The state's role extends beyond mere market failure correction to include social welfare, strategic planning, and regulation.


**1. With reference to India's foreign trade and its impact on aggregate demand, consider the following statements:**

1.  Increased imports of foreign goods lead to a decrease in aggregate demand for domestically produced goods due to leakages in the circular flow of income.
2.  Exports act as an injection into the circular flow, boosting aggregate demand for domestically produced goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the dual impact of foreign trade on aggregate demand within an open economy.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the leakage effect of imports. When a country imports goods, the spending leaves the domestic circular flow of income, reducing the demand for domestically produced goods. This is a fundamental concept in macroeconomics. Statement 2 is equally correct in highlighting the injection effect of exports.  Exports represent an inflow of demand from foreign consumers for domestically produced goods, thus stimulating aggregate demand and boosting domestic production.  The combined effect of these two opposing forces (leakages and injections) determines the net impact of foreign trade on a nation's aggregate demand. Therefore, both statements are essential components of understanding the open economy model.


**2. With reference to the international monetary system and currency convertibility, consider the following statements:**

1.  A national currency's acceptance as an international medium of exchange hinges on its perceived stable purchasing power; a lack of confidence undermines its international use.
2.  Governments aim to instill confidence in their currencies by guaranteeing their free convertibility at a fixed price into another asset, like gold, over which they have no control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate descriptions of key aspects of the international monetary system.  Statement 1 correctly emphasizes the crucial role of confidence in maintaining a currency's international standing.  Without trust in its stability, a currency becomes unreliable as a medium of exchange and unit of account in international transactions. This is because there is no global authority to enforce the use of any particular currency.  Statement 2 accurately explains a common strategy employed by governments to build this crucial confidence: the commitment to freely convert their currency into a stable asset like gold or another major currency at a fixed exchange rate. This demonstrates a commitment to maintaining currency value and stability, thereby increasing confidence among international economic agents.  The credibility of this commitment depends on both the ability to convert freely and the stability of the conversion rate.  The breakdown of the Bretton Woods system exemplifies the challenges in maintaining such fixed-rate commitments.


**3. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The current account records transactions in goods and services, including invisible trade (factor and non-factor income) and transfer payments.
2.  The capital account records international purchases and sales of assets, with payments to foreigners entered as debits and receipts from foreigners as credits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements provide accurate definitions of the current and capital accounts within the Balance of Payments (BoP) framework. Statement 1 correctly defines the current account, encompassing visible trade (exports and imports of goods), invisible trade (services like shipping, banking, and tourism; factor income like investment returns; and non-factor income), and unilateral transfers (gifts and grants).  These transactions do not involve changes in ownership of assets. Statement 2 accurately describes the capital account, which tracks the flow of capital across borders.  This includes purchases and sales of assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate, impacting a country's foreign assets and liabilities. The double-entry bookkeeping system employed in BoP ensures that payments to foreigners (outflows) are recorded as debits, while receipts from foreigners (inflows) are recorded as credits. The overall balance of the BoP reflects the net effect of these transactions.


**4. With reference to the foreign exchange market and exchange rates, consider the following statements:**

1. The nominal exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another, expressed in money terms (e.g., rupees per dollar).
2. The real exchange rate accounts for the relative purchasing power of currencies by adjusting for price level differences between countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately define key concepts in international finance. Statement 1 correctly defines the nominal exchange rate as the direct price of one currency in terms of another. This is a simple and commonly used measure of currency value.  It is often quoted in bilateral terms (e.g., USD/INR or EUR/USD) and reflects the amount of one currency required to purchase one unit of another.  Statement 2 accurately describes the real exchange rate, which is a more nuanced concept. It adjusts the nominal exchange rate for differences in price levels between countries.  This adjustment is crucial because it indicates the relative purchasing power of currencies, allowing for a more meaningful comparison of goods and services across countries.  The real exchange rate helps determine whether goods are relatively cheaper in one country than another, influencing trade flows.


**5. With reference to the concepts of autonomous and accommodating transactions in the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. Autonomous transactions are independent of the BoP's overall state and are driven by factors like profit motives.
2. Accommodating transactions are determined by the net outcome of autonomous transactions (surplus or deficit) and include official reserve transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly distinguish between autonomous and accommodating transactions within the BoP framework.  Statement 1 accurately defines autonomous transactions as those driven by independent economic decisions, unaffected by the current state of the BoP.  These are primarily market-driven transactions, such as private investment decisions or trade based on price differences.  They are often referred to as "above the line" items. Statement 2 correctly identifies accommodating transactions as those that adjust to the net effect of autonomous transactions.  If autonomous transactions result in a BoP deficit, accommodating transactions (like official reserve transactions—the central bank selling foreign currency reserves) are undertaken to finance the deficit. Conversely, if there's a surplus, accommodating transactions may involve accumulating foreign currency reserves.  These are often referred to as "below the line" items and serve to maintain BoP equilibrium.


**6.  With reference to India's exchange rate management, consider the following statements:**

1.  Following the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system, India delinked the rupee from the pound sterling in 1975.
2.  The Liberalised Exchange Rate Management System (LERMS) introduced in 1992 involved a dual exchange rate system that was later converged into a single market-determined rate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key phases in the evolution of India's exchange rate policy.  Statement 1 correctly notes that after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, which had pegged the Indian rupee to the British pound, India moved to a more independent system in 1975. This decision reflected the changing global economic landscape and India's diversification of trade partners.  Statement 2 correctly describes the introduction of the LERMS in 1992 as a crucial step toward market-determined exchange rates.  Initially, this system involved a dual exchange rate—a fixed official rate and a market-determined rate—but the two were subsequently unified in 1993, marking significant progress towards current account convertibility.  This shift towards a more flexible exchange rate regime was part of India's broader economic liberalization reforms.


**7. With reference to the impact of economic reforms on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  While GDP growth increased after the reforms, concerns remain about insufficient employment generation.
2.  The agricultural sector has experienced decelerating growth due to reduced public investment and the removal of fertilizer subsidies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements highlight significant aspects of the debate surrounding the consequences of economic reforms in India.  Statement 1 accurately points out that while India has seen notable GDP growth since the reforms, there are persistent concerns about the employment elasticity of this growth.  The reforms, while boosting overall economic output, haven't necessarily translated into sufficient job creation, particularly in sectors outside of services.  This has led to critiques about the inclusiveness of the growth process. Statement 2 correctly identifies the challenges faced by the agricultural sector.  Reduced public investment in agricultural infrastructure (irrigation, power, etc.) and the removal of fertilizer subsidies have increased production costs, disproportionately affecting small and marginal farmers. Consequently, agricultural growth has slowed down, raising concerns about food security and rural livelihoods.  The impact of WTO agreements on agricultural trade further complicates the situation.


**8. With reference to India's engagement with the World Trade Organization (WTO), consider the following statements:**

1.  India has fulfilled its WTO commitments by removing quantitative restrictions on imports and reducing tariff rates.
2.  Some scholars question the benefits of India's WTO membership due to the disproportionate trade volume among developed nations and perceived unfair practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements reflect ongoing discussions about India's experience with the WTO.  Statement 1 acknowledges that India has largely adhered to its commitments under the WTO agreements by liberalizing its trade regime.  This includes reducing quantitative restrictions (quotas) on imports and lowering tariff rates.  However, this liberalization has faced criticism, as reflected in Statement 2. This statement accurately captures the concerns raised by some scholars regarding the WTO's effectiveness in promoting fair trade for developing countries.  They argue that the bulk of international trade occurs among developed nations, leaving developing countries at a disadvantage.  Furthermore, they highlight concerns about developed countries' agricultural subsidies and unequal market access, suggesting that the WTO framework hasn't always delivered on its promise of creating a level playing field for all members.


**9. With reference to inclusive growth in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Inclusive growth aims to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are equitably shared across all segments of the population, irrespective of their socioeconomic background.
2.  High economic growth rates, while necessary, are insufficient for achieving inclusive growth, which requires attention to employment quality, human development, and reducing social and regional disparities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the core tenets of inclusive growth as a development strategy.  Statement 1 correctly defines inclusive growth as a process that prioritizes equitable distribution of growth benefits.  This means that economic progress must not only increase overall wealth but must also reach marginalized sections of society, such as those in rural areas, women, and members of disadvantaged castes and classes.  This goes beyond simply increasing GDP and focuses on ensuring that the benefits of growth are widely shared. Statement 2 correctly points out that while rapid economic growth is a necessary condition for poverty reduction, it is not sufficient on its own to guarantee inclusive growth.  Inclusive growth requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses issues such as the quality of employment generated, improvements in human development indicators (health, education), and the reduction of existing social and regional inequalities.  Simply achieving high GDP growth without addressing these issues could worsen existing disparities.


**10. With reference to Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and India's trade policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's FTAs have generally led to increased trade with partner countries, but this increase has been more pronounced on the import side than the export side.
2.  India has signed FTAs with several countries, including the UAE and Australia, and is currently negotiating FTAs with several other nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of India's FTA strategy and its outcomes. Statement 1 correctly points out an important aspect of India's FTA experience: while FTAs have stimulated trade, the increase in imports has often outweighed the increase in exports.  This is partly due to India's relatively higher tariff rates before the FTAs, leading to larger tariff reductions on the import side compared to its partners.  This highlights the importance of considering the specifics of the FTA negotiations and their impact on a country's trade balance. Statement 2 is also correct in its assertion that India has actively pursued FTAs as a component of its foreign policy.  The examples of the UAE and Australia are accurate, and the ongoing negotiations with other countries demonstrate India's commitment to strengthening its trade relationships through preferential trade agreements.  The success of these FTAs, however, depends on various factors, including the terms of the agreement, the competitiveness of Indian industries, and global economic conditions.


**11. With reference to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), consider the following statements:**

1. India withdrew from the RCEP negotiations primarily due to concerns about increased competition from cheaper imports, especially from China, and inadequate safeguards for its domestic industries.
2.  Other concerns that led to India's withdrawal from RCEP included insufficient provisions for rules of origin, potential negative impacts on its dairy sector, and limited market access for Indian labor and services.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately capture the key reasons behind India's decision to withdraw from the RCEP negotiations. Statement 1 correctly highlights the central concern about increased competition from cheaper imports, particularly from China.  India already had a significant trade deficit with many RCEP members, and further opening its market through RCEP was perceived as potentially leading to dumping of goods, harming its domestic industries. The lack of sufficient safeguards to prevent this was a major sticking point. Statement 2 correctly identifies several other important factors contributing to India's decision.  Concerns about weak rules of origin (which could allow circumvention of tariffs), the potential negative impact on its dairy sector from increased competition, and the limited market access for Indian labor and services in RCEP member countries further solidified the decision to withdraw.  These concerns underscore the complex considerations involved in negotiating and participating in large-scale regional trade agreements, particularly for developing countries.


**12. With reference to WTO-compliant measures for protecting domestic industries, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anti-dumping duties are imposed to counteract the effects of dumping, where goods are exported at prices lower than those in the exporting country.
2.  Countervailing duties are imposed to offset subsidies provided by governments to their exporters, preventing unfair competition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe WTO-compliant trade defense mechanisms. Statement 1 correctly defines anti-dumping duties.  Dumping occurs when a country exports goods at a price lower than their normal value in their domestic market, often to gain market share.  Anti-dumping duties are temporary tariffs levied by the importing country to offset the unfair price advantage, ensuring fair competition for its domestic producers. These duties are imposed only after an investigation demonstrates injury to the domestic industry. Statement 2 correctly explains countervailing duties. These duties are imposed to counteract the effects of government subsidies provided to exporters in other countries.  Subsidies can give those exporters an unfair price advantage, and countervailing duties level the playing field by adding a tariff equal to the amount of the subsidy.  Both anti-dumping and countervailing duties are subject to WTO rules and procedures to prevent their misuse for protectionist purposes.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1.  It primarily aims to provide credit to small and marginal farmers for specific crop cultivation.
2.  A key objective is to integrate small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is a scheme designed to provide funding to micro/small units and entrepreneurs.  Its core purpose is to bring these units into the formal financial system, offering them access to credit and other financial services. Statement 2 accurately reflects this objective. Statement 1 is incorrect because PMMY's focus is not solely on farmers or specific crops. While some farmers may benefit from PMMY loans, the scheme's scope is broader, encompassing various micro and small businesses across different sectors.  The other options are incorrect because they either incorrectly attribute a specific focus to PMMY (a) or negate both its primary and secondary goals (d).  Understanding the scheme's overall goal of financial inclusion is crucial for a correct answer.


**2. Consider the following statements about the Government's Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme:**

1.  A primary goal is to increase Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the gold and jewelry sector.
2.  These schemes aim to channel idle gold held by households into the formal economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Both the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and the Gold Monetization Scheme are aimed at mobilizing the large amount of gold held as idle assets within Indian households.  By offering attractive options for investment and monetization, the government seeks to bring this gold into the formal financial system, boosting the economy.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this objective. Statement 1 is incorrect; neither scheme is primarily designed to attract FDI in the gold sector.  While FDI might indirectly benefit from increased economic activity, it's not the central purpose. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the primary objectives of these schemes.  The focus on domestic gold reserves is key to understanding the correct answer.


**3. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NPCI's primary function is to launch new card payment schemes, such as RuPay.
2.  The NPCI plays a significant role in promoting financial inclusion within India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NPCI has a dual mandate: developing and managing retail payment systems and promoting financial inclusion. While the launch of RuPay is a notable achievement, it is not the NPCI's sole or primary function.  The corporation manages a wide range of payment systems designed to enhance efficiency and reach.  Statement 2 is also correct, as the NPCI's initiatives have significantly expanded access to financial services for previously underserved populations, thus promoting financial inclusion.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the dual and interconnected nature of the NPCI's objectives.  The importance of both aspects to the NPCI's mandate makes understanding both statements essential for answering correctly.


**4. With reference to Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SFBs are primarily focused on supplying credit to large corporate entities.
2.  One of their objectives is to extend credit to small and marginal farmers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Small Finance Banks (SFBs) in India are specifically designed to cater to the financial needs of underserved segments of the population.  Their focus is on providing credit and other financial services to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), including small and marginal farmers. Statement 2 accurately reflects this core objective. Statement 1 is incorrect because SFBs do not primarily target large corporate entities; that is the domain of larger commercial banks. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not reflect the specific mandate and focus of SFBs.  Understanding the niche role of SFBs in the Indian financial landscape is key to choosing the correct answer.


**5. With reference to the "Merchant Discount Rate" (MDR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The MDR is an incentive paid by the government to merchants for promoting digital payments.
2.  It represents a charge levied by a bank on a merchant for accepting payments via debit cards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a fee charged by banks to merchants for processing debit and credit card transactions.  This fee covers the bank's costs associated with the transaction. Statement 2 accurately describes the MDR. Statement 1 is incorrect; the MDR is not a government incentive but a fee paid to banks.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the nature of the MDR as either a government incentive or something other than a fee charged to merchants.  Understanding the difference between a fee and an incentive is crucial for answering correctly.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning legal tender money:**

1.  Legal tender money refers exclusively to metallic currency circulating within a country.
2.  A creditor is legally obligated to accept legal tender money in settlement of debts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Legal tender refers to currency that a creditor must accept as payment for a debt.  This definition includes both paper and metallic currency. Statement 2 correctly defines legal tender's compulsory acceptance. Statement 1 is incorrect because it limits legal tender to only metallic currency, excluding paper money which is also legal tender in most economies.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the definition of legal tender.  Understanding the legal enforceability of legal tender is key to answering this question correctly.


**7. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and government securities, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI manages and services only Central Government securities, not State Government securities.
2.  Treasury bills are exclusively issued by the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the RBI does manage and service a significant portion of Central Government securities, it also engages with State Government securities.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; treasury bills, a form of short-term debt instrument, are primarily issued by the Central Government.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the RBI's role in managing government securities at various levels.  Understanding the scope of the RBI's functions in the financial market is crucial for answering this question.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR):**

1.  The CAR is determined by each individual bank based on its own risk assessment.
2.  The CAR mandates that banks maintain sufficient funds to cover potential losses from loan defaults.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a regulatory requirement, not a decision made by individual banks.  While banks' internal risk assessments inform their capital planning, the minimum CAR is set by regulatory authorities.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; the CAR is designed to ensure that banks have enough capital to absorb potential losses from bad loans and other risks.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the regulatory nature of the CAR and its purpose.  Understanding the regulatory framework surrounding banking capital is essential for answering this question accurately.


**9. With reference to the assets of a commercial bank in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Deposits held by customers are considered an asset of the bank.
2.  Advances (loans given by the bank) are classified as assets of the bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

For a commercial bank, deposits are liabilities, not assets.  They represent money the bank owes to its depositors. Statement 1 is, therefore, incorrect.  Advances (loans) are assets because they represent money owed to the bank by borrowers.  Statement 2 is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the fundamental accounting principles governing bank balance sheets.  A clear understanding of the difference between assets and liabilities in banking is crucial for answering correctly.


**10. With reference to factors mitigating currency crisis risk in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Increasing government expenditure significantly reduces the risk of a currency crisis.
2.  Remittances from Indians working abroad contribute to mitigating currency crisis risk.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While government expenditure can have an impact on the economy, it does not directly and reliably mitigate currency crisis risk.  Uncontrolled government spending can even exacerbate such risks. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Remittances from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) increase foreign currency inflows, strengthening the country's foreign exchange reserves and thus reducing vulnerability to currency crises.  Statement 2 is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the relationship between government spending and currency risk.  Understanding the dynamics of foreign exchange reserves and their role in currency stability is crucial for a correct answer.


**11. With reference to measures taken by the Government/RBI to counter a slide in the Indian rupee's value, consider the following statements:**

1.  Easing external commercial borrowing conditions helps curb the rupee's decline.
2.  Following an expansionary monetary policy is an effective measure to stop the rupee's fall.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Easing external commercial borrowing conditions can actually worsen a rupee depreciation by increasing demand for foreign currency. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. An expansionary monetary policy, which increases money supply, tends to weaken a currency, not strengthen it.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the effects of these policy tools on exchange rates.  Understanding the mechanics of monetary policy and its impact on exchange rates is necessary for a correct response.


**12. Consider the following statements about factors influencing the money multiplier:**

1.  An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) leads to an increase in the money multiplier.
2.  Increased banking habits among the population increase the money multiplier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The cash reserve ratio (CRR) is the percentage of deposits that banks must hold with the central bank.  A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thus decreasing the money multiplier. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Increased use of banking services leads to a larger proportion of money being deposited in banks, increasing the money multiplier. Statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the relationship between CRR and the money multiplier. A strong understanding of monetary policy mechanisms is required for a correct answer.


**13. With reference to actions that could provide immunity to India during a global financial crisis, consider the following statements:**

1.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility offers significant protection against financial crises.
2.  Reducing reliance on short-term foreign borrowings enhances resilience to global financial shocks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Full capital account convertibility, while offering some benefits, also increases vulnerability to sudden capital flight during a global crisis. Statement 1 is, therefore, incorrect. Reducing reliance on short-term debt makes a country less susceptible to sudden capital outflows and the resulting financial instability. Statement 2 is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the risks and benefits of capital account convertibility and the importance of managing short-term debt.  A sound understanding of international finance and risk management is vital for accurate assessment.


**14. Consider the following statements about the immediate effect of a large cash withdrawal from a demand deposit account:**

1.  The aggregate money supply in the economy immediately increases by the amount withdrawn.
2.  The withdrawal directly reduces the aggregate money supply by the amount withdrawn.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

When cash is withdrawn from a demand deposit account, the money supply in the banking system decreases directly by that amount.  The currency in circulation increases, but the overall effect is a reduction in the money supply because the money is no longer available for lending and creating credit. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect because the immediate effect is a reduction, not an increase, in the money supply.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the immediate impact of cash withdrawals on the money supply.  Understanding the relationship between currency in circulation and the broader money supply is crucial for answering this question correctly.


**15. With reference to the purposes of short-term credit support under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  It covers post-harvest expenses for farmers.
2.  It includes funding for the construction of a family house.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kisan Credit Card scheme provides short-term credit to farmers for various agricultural needs.  Post-harvest expenses, such as transportation and storage, are included under the scheme. Statement 1 is therefore correct.  However, the scheme does not cover non-agricultural expenses like house construction. Statement 2 is incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the KCC scheme's scope.  Knowing the specific purposes of KCC credit is essential for answering correctly.


**16. With reference to financial instruments in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Commercial Paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note.
2.  Certificates of Deposit are long-term instruments issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to corporations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Commercial Paper (CP) is indeed a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds.  Statement 1 is correct.  Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term borrowings issued by banks, not the RBI, to corporations.  Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the characteristics of these financial instruments.  Understanding the differences between various short-term debt instruments in the Indian financial market is crucial for answering correctly.


**17.  With reference to the characteristics of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FDI primarily involves investment through capital instruments in listed companies.
2. FDI is largely a non-debt-creating capital flow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While FDI can involve investment in listed companies, it also includes investments in unlisted companies and greenfield ventures.  Statement 1 is therefore an oversimplification.  FDI is primarily equity investment, representing ownership stakes in companies, and is not typically debt-based.  Statement 2 is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to fully capture the breadth and nature of FDI.  A comprehensive understanding of FDI is needed to differentiate it from other forms of investment.


**18.  With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI Governor's authority is derived solely from the RBI Act.
2. The Central Government has the constitutional right to issue directions to the RBI in the public interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RBI Governor's powers are primarily defined by the RBI Act, but the Central Government's ability to issue directions in the public interest is also a significant factor.  Statement 1 is an oversimplification.  The Constitution of India allows for the Central Government to give directions to the RBI in the public interest.  Statement 2 is correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the interplay between the RBI Act and constitutional provisions.  Understanding the governance structure of the RBI is crucial for answering correctly.


**19. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. UCBs are supervised and regulated by local boards established by State Governments.
2. UCBs are permitted to issue both equity and preference shares.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While State Governments play a role in overseeing UCBs, the primary regulatory body is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  Statement 1 is, therefore, incorrect.  UCBs are allowed to raise capital through the issuance of equity and preference shares. Statement 2 is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to a lack of clarity on the regulatory structure and capital-raising mechanisms of UCBs.  Understanding the regulatory framework and financial instruments available to UCBs is essential for an accurate answer.


**20. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following statements:**

1. Actions by the United States Federal Reserve have no significant impact on Indian Government Bond Yields.
2. Inflation and short-term interest rates are major factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The actions of the US Federal Reserve, particularly regarding interest rate changes, influence global capital flows and thus have an impact on Indian Government Bond Yields.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Inflation and short-term interest rates are major determinants of bond yields, reflecting the risk and opportunity cost of holding bonds.  Statement 2 is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to a lack of understanding of the global interconnectedness of financial markets.  Understanding the factors affecting bond yields in a globalized economy is crucial for a correct answer.


**21. With reference to what constitutes Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), consider the following:**

1. Foreign currency convertible bonds are a form of FDI.
2. Non-resident external deposits are considered FDI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency convertible bonds are not typically classified as FDI; they are debt instruments with an option to convert to equity.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  Non-resident external deposits are short-term investments and do not represent ownership stakes, therefore they are not FDI.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misclassify these financial instruments.  A clear understanding of FDI's definition and characteristics is essential for answering accurately.


**22. Consider the following statements regarding the effects of currency devaluation:**

1. Currency devaluation necessarily improves a country's trade balance.
2. Currency devaluation always increases the foreign value of the domestic currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While devaluation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, it does not guarantee an improved trade balance.  Other factors like global demand and supply elasticities also play a role.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  Devaluation, by definition, decreases the value of the domestic currency in foreign exchange markets.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the complex effects of devaluation on a country's trade balance and exchange rate.  A nuanced understanding of international trade and exchange rate dynamics is necessary for a correct response.


**23. With reference to factors that can cause or increase demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following:**

1. Rising interest rates are a primary cause of demand-pull inflation.
2. Expansionary fiscal policies can contribute to demand-pull inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Rising interest rates tend to curb inflation by reducing borrowing and spending.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Expansionary fiscal policies, such as increased government spending or tax cuts, can boost aggregate demand, leading to demand-pull inflation. Statement 2 is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the relationship between monetary policy, fiscal policy, and demand-pull inflation.  A clear understanding of macroeconomic principles is required for a correct answer.



Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation of the correct answer and why the other options are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  In a "Fixed and Adjustable" exchange rate system, a country fixes its exchange rate with respect to a major currency (like the dollar) but can adjust or devalue/revalue its currency based on economic conditions.
2.  Under a "Managed Float" exchange rate system, the central bank never intervenes in the foreign exchange market, leaving the currency's value entirely to market forces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a "Fixed and Adjustable" exchange rate system.  India employed this system before 1993, pegging its rupee to the dollar but making adjustments as needed to address balance of payments issues or inflation.  The system allowed for some flexibility within a managed framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A "Managed Float" system, unlike a "Free Float," involves central bank intervention to manage currency volatility.  The central bank buys or sells foreign currency to stabilize the exchange rate, preventing excessive fluctuations.  The Indian rupee operates under a managed float system.  A "Free Float" system, where the central bank does not intervene, is exemplified by countries like the US and Japan.


**2. With reference to the functions of money, consider the following statements:**

1.  Money serves as a store of value, preserving wealth over time, but its value is always stable regardless of inflation.
2.  Money acts as a unit of account, enabling the valuation of goods and services in a standardized unit, facilitating comparisons and economic calculations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly identifies the unit of account function of money.  A common monetary unit (like the rupee or dollar) allows for easy comparison of the values of diverse goods and services, simplifying economic transactions and analysis.

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. While money does act as a store of value, its value is not always stable.  During periods of high inflation, the purchasing power of money erodes, reducing its value as a store of wealth.  Other assets, such as gold or property, can also serve as stores of value, sometimes offering better protection against inflation.


**3. With reference to exchange rate systems, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under a free float exchange rate system, the central bank actively intervenes to maintain a specific exchange rate, usually against a major currency.
2.  A managed float system allows for some exchange rate fluctuation but involves central bank intervention to moderate excessive volatility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes a managed float system.  This system, adopted by many countries including India, allows market forces to determine the exchange rate within a certain range. However, the central bank intervenes to manage excessive fluctuations or prevent sharp depreciations or appreciations that could destabilize the economy.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A free float system is characterized by the *absence* of central bank intervention. The exchange rate is determined solely by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market.  The definition in statement 1 describes a fixed or pegged exchange rate system.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding securities:**

1.  Equity securities represent ownership in a company and offer fixed returns in the form of interest payments.
2.  Debt securities represent a loan to a company or government and entitle the holder to a share of the company's profits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  Equity securities (stocks or shares) represent ownership in a company and offer returns in the form of dividends (a share of profits) and capital gains (increase in share price).  Returns are not fixed.  Debt securities (bonds) represent a loan and offer fixed returns in the form of interest payments.  The holder does not receive a share of profits. The statements confuse the characteristics of equity and debt securities.


**5. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1.  A current account deficit indicates that a country is importing more goods and services than it is exporting.
2.  A current account surplus is always financed by a net capital outflow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes a current account deficit.  It reflects a situation where a country's spending on imports (goods, services, and income payments) exceeds its earnings from exports.  This imbalance needs to be financed through borrowing or selling assets (capital account).

Statement 2 is incorrect. A current account *surplus* is financed by a net capital outflow.  A surplus means a country is earning more from exports than it is spending on imports.  This excess is often invested abroad, leading to a net capital outflow.  A current account deficit is financed by a net capital inflow.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the determination of exchange rates:**

1.  In a flexible exchange rate system, the exchange rate is determined solely by government intervention.
2.  Interest rate differentials between countries can influence short-run exchange rate movements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  Interest rate differentials play a significant role in short-term exchange rate fluctuations.  Investors seek higher returns, so higher interest rates in a country attract foreign capital, increasing demand for that country's currency and causing appreciation.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In a flexible (or floating) exchange rate system, the exchange rate is primarily determined by market forces of supply and demand for the currency. Government intervention is limited to managing excessive volatility in a managed float system but not in a free float system.


**7. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) measures the value of the rupee against a basket of currencies, weighted by their importance in India's trade.
2.  An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) signifies a deterioration in India's international competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the NEER. It's a weighted average of bilateral exchange rates, reflecting the overall value of the rupee relative to a basket of currencies, considering their trade weights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An increase in REER indicates a *decline* in international competitiveness. It means that domestic goods have become relatively more expensive compared to foreign goods, making exports less attractive and imports more appealing.  A decrease in REER improves competitiveness.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory:**

1.  PPP theory predicts that exchange rates will adjust to equalize the prices of identical goods and services across countries in the long run, even considering transportation costs.
2.  Differences in inflation rates between countries are a major factor influencing exchange rate movements in the long run, according to PPP theory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly reflects a core tenet of PPP theory.  If one country experiences higher inflation than another, its currency is expected to depreciate over time to maintain purchasing power parity.  Differences in inflation rates drive long-run exchange rate adjustments.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PPP theory acknowledges that transportation costs and other trade barriers can prevent perfect price equalization across countries.  It predicts a tendency towards price convergence but not absolute equality, even in the long run.


**9. With reference to open economy macroeconomics, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in autonomous demand in an open economy leads to a larger increase in output compared to a closed economy.
2.  An increase in foreign income leads to an improvement in the trade balance of the domestic economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Higher foreign income boosts demand for exports from the domestic economy, improving the trade balance (exports minus imports).

Statement 1 is incorrect. The open economy multiplier is smaller than the closed economy multiplier due to leakages through imports.  An increase in autonomous demand will lead to a smaller increase in output in an open economy because a portion of the increased demand will be spent on imports, not domestically produced goods.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding India's exchange rate policy:**

1.  Post-independence, India initially pegged its rupee to the pound sterling due to its historical ties with Britain.
2.  India's adoption of the Liberalised Exchange Rate Management System (LERMS) in 1992 immediately resulted in full current account convertibility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes an early phase of India's exchange rate policy. The rupee was initially pegged to the pound sterling under the Bretton Woods system, reflecting the historical economic relationship between India and Britain.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  LERMS, introduced in 1992, involved a dual exchange rate system.  Full current account convertibility (meaning the freedom to convert domestic currency into foreign currency for current account transactions) was achieved only in August 1994, after the dual rates were converged into one.  LERMS was a transitional step towards full convertibility.


**11. With reference to India's trade agreements, consider the following statements:**

1. The India-UAE Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) provided zero duty access to 100% of India’s exports to the UAE.
2.  India's withdrawal from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was primarily due to concerns about increased competition in the dairy sector and the potential for dumping of goods from China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately highlights key reasons for India's withdrawal from RCEP. Concerns about increased competition from countries like Australia and New Zealand in the dairy sector, the potential for dumping from China, and inadequate safeguards against unfair trade practices were central to India's decision.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CEPA did significantly reduce tariffs and increase market access for many Indian exports to the UAE, it did not provide *zero* duty access to 100% of them.  The agreement aimed for substantial tariff reduction but not complete elimination across all products.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding WTO agreements:**

1. The WTO's "Most Favoured Nation" (MFN) principle mandates that any trade concessions granted to one member must be extended to all other members without exception.
2. The WTO's "National Treatment" principle requires that imported goods be treated no less favorably than domestically produced goods once they have entered the domestic market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect core principles of the WTO. The MFN principle promotes non-discrimination among trading partners, ensuring that any preferential treatment given to one country is extended to all others.  The National Treatment principle ensures fair competition between imported and domestically produced goods within a country's market after import duties have been paid.  There are exceptions allowed under MFN principle like FTA, security clause and special and differential treatment given to developing countries.


**13. With reference to trade protection measures, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anti-dumping duties are imposed to counteract the effects of unfair trade practices like dumping, where goods are exported at prices below their normal value.
2.  Countervailing duties are levied to offset subsidies provided by exporting governments to their producers, ensuring fair competition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe WTO-compliant trade protection measures. Anti-dumping duties are used to counter dumping, a practice where goods are sold below cost in foreign markets to gain market share.  Countervailing duties are imposed to neutralize the competitive advantage gained by exporters through government subsidies.  Both measures aim to ensure fair trade and prevent injury to domestic industries.  These are country specific.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the Uruguay Round of WTO negotiations:**

1.  The Uruguay Round led to the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
2.  The Uruguay Round primarily focused on trade in goods, neglecting other areas like services and intellectual property rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Uruguay Round (1986-1994) was a significant milestone in international trade negotiations. It resulted in the establishment of the WTO, a more formal and robust institution to govern global trade, replacing the provisional GATT.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Uruguay Round built upon previous GATT negotiations concerning goods, it significantly expanded the scope of trade rules to include new areas like services (GATS), intellectual property rights (TRIPS), and agriculture.  It was a much broader and more comprehensive round of negotiations than its predecessors.


**15. With reference to different types of trade agreements, consider the following statements:**

1. A Free Trade Area (FTA) involves the elimination of tariffs among member countries but allows each member to maintain its own tariffs on imports from non-member countries.
2. A Customs Union (CU) is a type of FTA where member countries not only eliminate tariffs among themselves but also adopt a common external tariff (CET) on imports from non-members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately define key differences between FTAs and CUs. FTAs focus on eliminating tariffs within the bloc but allow members to retain independent trade policies with non-members. CUs go a step further by harmonizing external tariffs, creating a unified trade policy towards the rest of the world.  The common external tariff creates a single market with uniform tariffs, eliminating trade diversion and promoting efficiency in resource allocation.  A common market goes even further by allowing free movement of factors of production.  An economic union goes further by coordinating macroeconomic and exchange rate policies.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a high difficulty level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.

**1. With reference to India's engagement with the World Trade Organization (WTO), consider the following statements:**

1. India's proposal in the ongoing WTO reform discussions emphasizes safeguarding development concerns and promoting inclusive growth while preserving the core values of the Multilateral Trading System.
2. India's participation in the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) resulted in a significant increase in its global market share for IT products between 1997 and 2003.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's position within the WTO reflects a consistent advocacy for the interests of developing nations. Its proposals for reform highlight the need for balanced trade liberalization that considers developmental priorities and inclusive growth, alongside upholding the core principles of the multilateral trading system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's experience with the ITA was largely discouraging, with minimal gains in market share.  In contrast, China significantly increased its global market share in IT products during this period.  This highlights the complexities of multilateral trade agreements and their varying impact on participating nations with different levels of economic development and industrial capacity. The statement misrepresents the actual outcome of India's participation in ITA.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India's Free Trade Agreements (FTAs):**

1.  India's FTAs have consistently led to a larger increase in exports compared to imports, primarily due to its relatively low tariff rates before signing these agreements.
2.  The India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) includes provisions related to technical barriers to trade (TBT), sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, and the movement of natural persons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's FTAs have increased trade with partner countries, the increase has been more pronounced on the import side. This is because India, prior to signing these agreements, maintained relatively high tariffs, leading to larger tariff reductions than its partners after the agreements were implemented.  This highlights the potential asymmetry in benefits from FTAs for countries with different pre-existing tariff structures.

Statement 2 is correct. The India-Australia ECTA is a comprehensive agreement covering a wide range of areas, including those mentioned. The inclusion of TBT and SPS measures reflects the importance of addressing technical and regulatory barriers to trade, while provisions for the movement of natural persons address the mobility of skilled labor and professionals.  This demonstrates a move towards deeper economic integration beyond simply reducing tariffs.



**3. With reference to the impact of economic reforms in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The reform process led to a significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign exchange reserves, but it also resulted in a deceleration of agricultural growth.
2.  The disinvestment of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) consistently met or exceeded its annual targets, and the proceeds were primarily used for the development of PSUs and social infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's economic reforms did indeed lead to substantial increases in FDI and foreign exchange reserves. However, the agricultural sector experienced decelerating growth due to factors such as reduced public investment, the removal of fertilizer subsidies, and increased international competition following WTO accession. This highlights the uneven impact of reforms across different sectors of the economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the disinvestment of PSUs often met or exceeded targets, the proceeds were frequently used to offset government revenue shortfalls rather than being reinvested in PSU development or social infrastructure. This raises concerns about the effectiveness and long-term implications of the disinvestment strategy.  The statement presents an overly optimistic view of the disinvestment process and its outcomes.



**4. With reference to the WTO agreements, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures allows countries to set their own food safety and animal and plant health standards, but these standards must be based on scientific evidence and not arbitrarily discriminate against other countries.
2. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) aims to eliminate all forms of domestic support (subsidies) for agriculture, ensuring a completely free and undistorted global agricultural market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The SPS Agreement acknowledges the right of countries to protect human, animal, and plant life through appropriate regulations. However, it mandates that these measures be science-based and avoid unjustified discrimination. This reflects a balance between safeguarding public health and promoting fair international trade.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AoA aims to *discipline* and *reduce* domestic support for agriculture, not eliminate it entirely.  The agreement recognizes the complexities of agricultural policies and the importance of allowing countries some flexibility in supporting their farmers, while trying to minimize trade distortions.  The statement oversimplifies the goals and mechanisms of the AoA.


**5.  With reference to  the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, consider the following statements:**

1. The IMF primarily focuses on providing short-term loans to member countries experiencing balance of payments problems, while the World Bank primarily focuses on long-term development financing.
2. Both the IMF and the World Bank are headquartered in Washington D.C., and their voting power is based solely on the share of each member country in the global economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The IMF's primary mandate is to maintain global monetary stability and provide short-term financial assistance to countries facing balance of payments crises.  The World Bank, on the other hand, focuses on long-term development projects and poverty reduction through loans and technical assistance.  While there are exceptions and overlaps in their activities, the core functions differ as stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both institutions are headquartered in Washington D.C., their voting power is not solely based on each member's share of the global economy.  Instead, it is determined by a quota system which considers various economic factors, and this system gives disproportionate influence to wealthier nations. This aspect has been a subject of criticism and calls for reform from developing countries.


**6. With reference to the measures available to a country to protect its domestic industry, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anti-dumping duties are imposed when goods are imported at prices lower than their normal value in the exporting country, and safeguard duties are imposed when there is a sudden surge in imports of a specific product, regardless of the exporting country.
2.  Countervailing duties are imposed to offset export subsidies provided by foreign governments, and they are always applied at a uniform rate across all importing countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct and accurately describes the application of anti-dumping and safeguard duties. Anti-dumping duties target unfair pricing practices by specific exporters, while safeguard duties address sudden import surges that can harm domestic industries. These are both WTO-compliant measures used to address specific trade-distorting practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While countervailing duties are used to neutralize export subsidies, the rate is not always uniform across all importing countries. The level of the countervailing duty is determined by an investigation into the extent of the subsidy and its impact on the domestic industry of the importing country. It is country-specific and depends on the level of injury caused to the domestic industry.


**7. With reference to India's Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. A current account deficit implies that a country is spending more abroad than it receives from sales to the rest of the world, and this deficit must be financed by selling assets or borrowing abroad.
2.  The overall balance of payments deficit (or surplus) is the decrease (increase) in a country's official reserves of foreign exchange, reflecting the ultimate financing of any BoP deficit or surplus by the monetary authorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements 1 and 2 correctly describe key aspects of a country's BoP.  Statement 1 accurately explains the nature of a current account deficit – a fundamental imbalance between a country's international payments and receipts. Statement 2 correctly identifies the role of official reserve transactions in accommodating BoP imbalances, highlighting the role of monetary authorities as the ultimate financiers of these deficits or recipients of surpluses.  This understanding is crucial for analyzing a country's macroeconomic stability and its interactions with the global economy.


**8. With reference to the foreign exchange market, consider the following statements:**

1. The real exchange rate measures the relative prices of goods in two countries, taking into account the nominal exchange rate and price levels in both countries.  A real exchange rate of one signifies purchasing power parity (PPP).
2. The foreign exchange market is primarily a physical market, with transactions taking place in designated locations like stock exchanges, and the participants are primarily commercial banks and government agencies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The real exchange rate is a crucial concept in international economics, providing a more meaningful measure of the relative cost of goods across different countries than the nominal exchange rate alone. PPP is a state where equivalent goods cost the same in different countries when expressed in a common currency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The foreign exchange market is a decentralized, global market that operates electronically across multiple locations and time zones.  While commercial banks are major players, many other entities participate, including corporations, hedge funds, and individuals.  The description presents an outdated and overly simplistic view of this complex market.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  A country with a current account deficit must finance it by selling assets or borrowing abroad, implying a net capital inflow.
2.  The overall balance of payments deficit (surplus) is reflected in the decrease (increase) in official reserves, with monetary authorities being the ultimate financiers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a fundamental principle of international finance.  A current account deficit signifies that a nation is spending more on foreign goods and services than it is earning from exports.  To bridge this gap, it must either draw down its existing assets (like foreign exchange reserves) or borrow from abroad, resulting in a net capital inflow. This inflow of capital serves to finance the current account deficit.

Statement 2 also correctly explains the role of official reserves and monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The overall balance of payments, which includes the current and capital accounts, is often reflected in changes to a country's official foreign exchange reserves.  A deficit leads to a decrease in reserves as the country uses them to cover its international obligations. Conversely, a surplus increases reserves.  Central banks, as the monetary authorities, play a crucial role in managing these reserves and ultimately finance any imbalances.  They act as the lender of last resort, intervening in foreign exchange markets to buy or sell currency to maintain stability.  Therefore, both statements are accurate reflections of balance of payments mechanics.


**2. With reference to the foreign exchange market, consider the following statements:**

1. The real exchange rate measures the relative prices of goods abroad compared to those at home, adjusting for nominal exchange rate fluctuations.
2. Purchasing power parity (PPP) holds when the real exchange rate equals one, implying goods cost the same in different countries when measured in the same currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the real exchange rate.  It's a crucial concept in international economics, going beyond the nominal exchange rate (the price of one currency in terms of another) by incorporating price levels in both the domestic and foreign countries.  The real exchange rate provides a more accurate picture of a country's relative price competitiveness in international trade. A higher real exchange rate indicates that foreign goods are relatively more expensive compared to domestic goods.

Statement 2 correctly explains purchasing power parity (PPP).  PPP is a theory that suggests that exchange rates between currencies should adjust to equalize the purchasing power of money in different countries.  When PPP holds, the real exchange rate is equal to one, meaning that a basket of goods costs the same in both countries when converted to a common currency.  While PPP is a theoretical concept, it's a useful benchmark for comparing economic conditions across countries and understanding real exchange rate movements.  Therefore, both statements provide accurate descriptions of key concepts in international finance.


**3. With reference to the balance of payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1. The current account records transactions affecting a country's assets or liabilities abroad, including foreign investment.
2. The capital account records exports and imports of goods and services, and transfer payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The current account focuses on transactions that *do not* directly alter a country's assets or liabilities abroad. These transactions include trade in goods and services (visible and invisible trade), income from investments, and transfer payments (like remittances and foreign aid).  Foreign investment, which directly impacts assets and liabilities, is recorded in the capital account.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The capital account records transactions that *do* directly affect a nation's assets or liabilities outside its borders. This includes foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investment, loans, and changes in foreign exchange reserves.  Trade in goods and services, and transfer payments, are components of the current account.  Therefore, both statements incorrectly assign the components of the balance of payments to the wrong accounts.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian economy's openness:**

1.  India's foreign trade as a proportion of GDP was substantially higher in 2004-2005 (38.9%) than in 1985-86 (16%).
2.  Compared to several other countries, India's foreign trade proportion is relatively higher, with some exceeding 50% of GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that India's total foreign trade (exports plus imports) as a percentage of GDP increased from 16% in 1985-86 to 38.9% in 2004-2005, representing a substantial rise in the economy's openness to international trade.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text directly contradicts this statement. It explicitly mentions that while India's openness has increased, it remains relatively *less* open compared to several other countries where foreign trade proportions exceed 50% of GDP.  This highlights that while India's integration with the global economy has grown, it still has a lower degree of openness than many of its global counterparts.


**5. With reference to the determination of income in an open economy, consider the following statements:**

1. The open economy multiplier is smaller than the closed economy multiplier because imports constitute an additional leakage from the circular flow of income.
2.  An increase in autonomous export demand increases equilibrium income, while an autonomous increase in import demand decreases it.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the impact of imports on the multiplier effect in an open economy.  In a closed economy, an increase in autonomous spending (like government spending or investment) leads to a multiplier effect on income as the increased spending circulates through the economy. However, in an open economy, a portion of this increased spending is diverted to imports, representing a leakage from the domestic circular flow. This leakage reduces the overall multiplier effect, resulting in a smaller increase in equilibrium income compared to a closed economy.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the impact of changes in export and import demand on equilibrium income. An increase in autonomous export demand directly boosts aggregate demand, leading to a rise in equilibrium income.  Conversely, an autonomous increase in import demand diverts spending away from domestically produced goods, reducing aggregate demand and thus lowering equilibrium income.  Hence, both statements accurately reflect the key differences in income determination between open and closed economies.


**6. With reference to  the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, consider the following statements:**

1. The IMF's primary objective is to promote international monetary cooperation and assist member countries with balance of payments problems.
2. The World Bank's main objective is to provide short-term, conditional loans to all member countries for policy reforms and specific projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the IMF's core mandate. The IMF's primary goals include fostering global monetary cooperation, securing financial stability, facilitating international trade, and providing assistance to member countries facing balance of payments difficulties.  Its role is crucial in maintaining the stability of the international monetary system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The World Bank, while providing loans, primarily focuses on long-term development projects in developing countries. While it can provide loans for policy reforms, it is not primarily focused on short-term lending to all member countries. The World Bank's lending is often geared towards long-term infrastructure development, poverty reduction, and sustainable economic growth, with a particular emphasis on developing economies.  The short-term, conditional loans described are more characteristic of the IMF's role during financial crises.


**7.  With reference to  the  International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. IFSCs in India are designated as Domestic transactions in Indian Rupees only and are treated as part of the domestic economy.
2.  The International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) is a unified regulator overseeing financial products, services, and institutions in IFSCs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  IFSCs, such as the one in GIFT City, are specifically designed to operate outside the purview of typical domestic regulations. While they may have a domestic zone, their primary function is to conduct transactions in foreign currencies and operate as offshore financial centers within India. Transactions are not limited to Indian Rupees. They are treated separately from the rest of the Indian economy for regulatory and tax purposes.

Statement 2 is correct. The IFSCA was established to streamline the regulation of IFSCs in India.  Prior to its formation, multiple regulators were involved, leading to potential inefficiencies. The IFSCA acts as a unified body, providing a more cohesive and efficient regulatory framework for financial activities within IFSCs.  This unified approach aims to attract foreign investment and make India a more competitive player in the global financial services market.


**8. Consider the following statements about  Strategic Disinvestment:**

1. Strategic disinvestment involves the sale of a substantial portion of government shareholding in a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE), along with the transfer of management control to a strategic partner.
2.  Central Government organizations (PSUs) and State Governments are allowed to bid and participate in strategic disinvestment processes for CPSEs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines strategic disinvestment. It's a key policy tool used by governments to reduce their stake in public sector enterprises and introduce private sector participation.  The crucial element is not just the sale of a significant portion of shares but also the transfer of management control to the strategic buyer, effectively privatizing the enterprise.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Government policy explicitly restricts the participation of other government organizations (PSUs) or State Governments in bidding for CPSEs undergoing strategic disinvestment.  This is to avoid continuing the inefficiencies often associated with government-run firms and ensure genuine private sector involvement to improve efficiency and competitiveness.  The aim is to bring in private sector management expertise, capital, and innovative approaches to revitalize and enhance the performance of the disinvested CPSEs.


**9. With reference to  the  measures for protection of the domestic industry under WTO rules, consider the following statements:**

1. Anti-dumping duty is imposed when goods are exported at a price lower than the normal value in the exporting country, causing injury to the domestic industry of the importing country.
2. Countervailing duty is imposed when a foreign government provides subsidies to its exporters, leading to unfair competition for the domestic industry in the importing country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly defines anti-dumping duty.  Anti-dumping measures are WTO-compliant tools used by importing countries to address the issue of dumping—the practice of selling goods in a foreign market at a price below their normal value in the exporting country.  This practice can cause significant harm to the domestic industry of the importing country, and anti-dumping duties are designed to offset this unfair pricing practice and protect domestic producers.  The imposition of such duties is contingent upon a demonstration of dumping and injury to the domestic industry.

Statement 2 accurately describes countervailing duties.  Countervailing duties are also WTO-consistent and are levied when foreign governments provide subsidies to their exporters, giving them an unfair price advantage in international markets. These subsidies can distort competition and harm the domestic industry of the importing country.  Countervailing duties are intended to neutralize the effect of these subsidies and restore a level playing field for domestic producers.  Therefore, both statements correctly describe legitimate trade defense mechanisms allowed under WTO rules.


**10. With reference to the components of the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The trade balance is the difference between the value of a country's exports and imports of goods.
2. The current account balance includes the trade balance, invisibles (trade in services), and net unilateral transfers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the trade balance. The trade balance, a key component of the balance of payments, simply reflects the net difference between the monetary value of a country's exports and imports of goods.  A positive trade balance (surplus) indicates that exports exceed imports, while a negative trade balance (deficit) indicates that imports exceed exports.

Statement 2 correctly describes the current account balance. The current account is a broader measure than the trade balance, encompassing not only the trade balance (goods) but also invisibles (services) and net unilateral transfers (like remittances, foreign aid, and gifts).  Invisibles represent the net flow of payments for services, such as tourism, transportation, and financial services. Net unilateral transfers reflect the net flow of payments made without any reciprocal transaction.  The current account balance provides a comprehensive picture of a country's overall international transactions related to goods, services, and transfers.


**11. With reference to  the  functions of money, consider the following statements:**

1. Money serves as a medium of exchange, facilitating transactions and reducing the need for barter.
2.  Money primarily serves as a store of value, preserving purchasing power over time, and is the most important function of money.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies one of the primary functions of money.  As a medium of exchange, money simplifies transactions by eliminating the need for a double coincidence of wants inherent in barter systems.  It serves as a universally accepted means of payment, making it far more efficient for individuals and businesses to conduct economic exchanges.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While money does serve as a store of value, preserving purchasing power over time, this is not its most important function. The most crucial function of money is its role as a medium of exchange, as this underpins the efficient functioning of modern economies.  The store of value function is important, but it's secondary to the facilitating role money plays in enabling transactions.  Other assets can also serve as stores of value (e.g., gold, real estate), but they are not as efficient as money in facilitating daily transactions.


**12. Consider the following statements on  the  impact of foreign trade on aggregate demand:**

1. Imports represent a leakage from the circular flow of income, decreasing aggregate demand.
2. Exports represent an injection into the circular flow of income, increasing aggregate demand for domestically produced goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly explains the impact of imports on aggregate demand. When a country imports goods and services, the money spent leaves the domestic economy, reducing the overall level of spending and hence aggregate demand within the country.  This is because the expenditure is directed towards foreign producers rather than domestic ones.

Statement 2 accurately describes the effect of exports on aggregate demand.  When a country exports goods and services, it receives payments from abroad, increasing the overall level of income and expenditure within the domestic economy. This inflow of money boosts aggregate demand, stimulating economic activity and increasing demand for domestically produced goods. Therefore, both statements accurately describe the dual impact of foreign trade on a country's aggregate demand.


**13. With reference to  the  different exchange rate regimes, consider the following statements:**

1. A currency board arrangement implies that a country's currency is pegged to another currency or a basket of currencies at a fixed exchange rate.
2. Dollarization involves a country abandoning its own currency and adopting another country's currency as its official currency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a currency board arrangement. A currency board is a monetary regime where a country commits to exchange its currency for another currency (or a basket of currencies) at a fixed exchange rate.  This arrangement severely restricts the ability of the central bank to control the money supply, as it must maintain sufficient reserves to back its currency at the fixed rate.  It's a highly restrictive regime aimed at achieving exchange rate stability.

Statement 2 correctly defines dollarization. Dollarization occurs when a country adopts another country's currency (typically the US dollar) as its legal tender, abandoning its own national currency. This eliminates exchange rate risk and can enhance price stability, but it also relinquishes monetary policy autonomy to the country whose currency is adopted.  Both describe distinct methods of managing exchange rates, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
