   Policy/Initiative                     Focus Area
1. Agriculture Export Policy 2018       :   Doubling agricultural exports by 2022
2. National Bamboo Mission            :   Rejuvenating the underdeveloped bamboo industry
3. National Food Security Act, 2013    :   Providing subsidized food grains to the poor
4. Minimum Support Price (MSP)       :   Protecting farmers' income from price fluctuations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Agriculture Export Policy 2018 explicitly aims to double agricultural exports, making pair 1 correct. The National Bamboo Mission focuses on the holistic growth of the bamboo sector, including industry rejuvenation, thus pair 2 is also accurate.  The National Food Security Act, 2013, is directly concerned with providing subsidized food grains to the poor, validating pair 3.  Finally, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism is a crucial policy instrument designed to safeguard farmers' incomes by ensuring a minimum price for their produce, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to Indian agriculture, consider the following pairs:**

   Farming System                     Characteristic
1. Primitive Subsistence Farming      :   High doses of biochemical inputs
2. Intensive Subsistence Farming     :   Use of primitive tools like hoe and dao
3. Commercial Farming                :   Single crop grown on a large area (plantation)
4. Mixed Farming                      :   Combination of crop production and livestock rearing

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Commercial farming is characterized by the use of modern inputs to achieve high productivity, and plantations, where a single crop is cultivated extensively, fall under this category.  Mixed farming, as the name suggests, combines crop production with livestock, poultry, or other allied activities. Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect because primitive subsistence farming uses primitive tools and relies on natural soil fertility, not high doses of inputs. Pair 2 is incorrect as intensive subsistence farming is characterized by high labor input and high-density cropping, not primitive tools. Option (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop Production Technique          Description
1. Intercropping                       :   Growing two or more crops simultaneously without a definite row pattern
2. Mixed Cropping                     :   Growing two or more crops simultaneously in alternate rows
3. Sequential Cropping                 :   Growing crops in quick succession on the same land
4. Relay Cropping                      :   Planting the succeeding crop before harvesting the preceding crop


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Sequential cropping involves planting crops in quick succession, and relay cropping involves planting the next crop before harvesting the previous one. These descriptions accurately reflect the techniques. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the definitions of intercropping and mixed cropping. Intercropping involves alternate rows or patterns, whereas mixed cropping lacks a definite pattern.


**4. With reference to irrigation in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Irrigation Source                   State/Region with Significant Usage

2. Wells                                 :   Indo-Gangetic Plain
3. Tubewells                            :   Peninsular Plateau
4. Tanks                                :   Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While canals are a significant source of irrigation across northern India, including parts of the Indo-Gangetic plain,  wells are more prevalent in regions with readily available groundwater, such as the Indo-Gangetic plain.  Tanks are a traditional irrigation method particularly common in the south, especially Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because canals are less prominent in eastern Uttar Pradesh compared to other irrigation methods. Pair 3 is incorrect as tubewells are more common in areas with deeper water tables, not necessarily the peninsular plateau.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Practice                 Description
1. Monocropping                       :   Growing more than one crop on the same land in a year
2. Multiple Cropping                   :   Growing only one crop on farmland year after year
3. Crop Rotation                       :   Changing the type of crops grown each season
4. Ratooning                          :   Allowing stubbles of the original crop to regrow


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Crop rotation involves systematically changing the crops grown on a field over time to improve soil health and prevent pest buildup. Ratooning is a technique where the stubble of a harvested crop is allowed to regenerate, producing a second crop. These definitions are accurate.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the definitions of monocropping and multiple cropping. Monocropping involves growing a single crop repeatedly, and multiple cropping involves growing more than one crop on the same land annually.

The State Federation plays a crucial role in marketing milk and dairy products produced by the district unions. Operation Flood, the successful dairy cooperative model, is indeed based on a three-tier structure connecting village societies, district unions, and state federations.  These descriptions are accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the roles of village societies and district unions. Village societies are where milk producers collect and sell their milk, and district unions are responsible for processing and marketing.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a thorough understanding of the material.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fertilizer                           Government Policy/Regulation
1. Urea                               :   Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS)
2. Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)      :   Market-driven pricing
3. Muriate of Potash (MoP)          :   Maximum Retail Price (MRP) fixed by the government
4. Complex Fertilizers (NPK)        :   Subsidy based on nutrient content


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Urea prices are regulated/fixed by the government, not under the NBS.  DAP and MoP prices are market-driven, meaning the government doesn't fix their MRP, but provides a nutrient-based subsidy. Complex fertilizers also receive subsidies based on nutrient content. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include urea under NBS or incorrectly attribute MRP fixation to DAP and MoP.  Understanding the difference between regulated pricing, market-driven pricing, and subsidy mechanisms is crucial for analyzing government interventions in the fertilizer sector.  This question tests factual recall and analytical skills regarding government policies on fertilizer pricing and subsidies.


**2. With reference to fertilizer subsidies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Policy                       Key Feature
1. New Urea Policy 2015              :   Direct Cash Transfer (DCT) to farmers
2. Retention Pricing Scheme (RPS)    :   12% fixed return on investment for manufacturers
3. Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS)      :   Subsidy based on the weight of fertilizer
4. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)      :   Point of Sale (PoS) machine-based subsidy disbursement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The New Urea Policy 2015 does not involve Direct Cash Transfer (DCT).  The RPS ensured a 12% return on investment for manufacturers. NBS provides subsidies based on nutrient content (not weight). DBT in fertilizers uses PoS machines for disbursement.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are accurately matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrect pairings, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the nuances of various subsidy schemes. The question assesses factual knowledge and the ability to distinguish between different subsidy mechanisms in the Indian fertilizer sector.

   Agency/Mechanism                     Function
1. Food Corporation of India (FCI)     :   Sets Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for all agricultural products
2. Minimum Support Price (MSP)       :   Price at which FCI purchases food grains from farmers
3. Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) :   Distribution of food grains through private retailers
4. Central Issue Price (CIP)           :   Price at which food grains are issued to state governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

FCI doesn't set MSPs; the government does. MSP is the price at which FCI procures from farmers. TPDS uses both government and private retailers. CIP is the price at which FCI issues to states.  Thus, only pairs 2 and 4 are correct. Other options incorrectly link FCI to MSP setting or TPDS solely to government distribution. This tests knowledge of the Indian food security system and its mechanisms.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Green Revolution's success is intrinsically linked to Norman Borlaug's development of high-yielding, disease-resistant wheat varieties.  The Agriculture Export Policy 2018 explicitly aimed to double agricultural exports by 2022. The Retention Pricing Scheme (RPS) for fertilizers guaranteed manufacturers a 12% return on investment.  However, ZBNF specifically *discourages* the use of chemical fertilizers, making pair 3 incorrect. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 4. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 1. Option (d) is incorrect because pair 3 is incorrectly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Sector Data              Value/Characteristic (2015-16)
1.  Total operated area                 :   159.59 million ha.
2.  Number of operational holdings      :   146.45 million
3.  Average size of operational holding :   1.15 ha.
4.  Agri-exports (FY 2021-22)          :  $31 billion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The provided text states that the number of operational holdings in 2015-16 was 146.45 million, making pair 2 correct.  However, the other pairs are incorrect. The total operated area in 2015-16 was 157.82 million ha., not 159.59 million ha. The average size of operational holding was 1.08 ha., not 1.15 ha.  Agricultural exports in FY 2021-22 were $50 billion, not $31 billion.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fertilizer Type                     Key Characteristic/Policy
1.  Urea                               :   Deregulated pricing
2.  DAP (P) and MOP (K)               :   Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS)
3.  Nano Urea                          :   Subsidized pricing
4.  Neem coated urea                   :   Mandatory since May 2015


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

DAP (P) and MOP (K) fertilizers are indeed subsidized under the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) scheme.  The use of neem-coated urea has been mandatory for domestic manufacturers and importers since May 2015.  However, Urea pricing is *regulated*, not deregulated.  Nano Urea, at the time of the text, was *not* subsidized.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Economy Sector              Characteristic/Data (2022-23)
1.  Agriculture                         :   54% share in GDP
2.  Industry                            :   30% share in GDP
3.  Services                            :   43% of labour force
4.  Agriculture (1947)                  :   15% share in GDP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text shows that in 2022-23, the industry sector constituted 30% of India's GDP, making pair 2 correct.  However, the other pairs are incorrect. Agriculture's share in GDP in 2022-23 was 16%, not 54%. The services sector constituted 32% of the labour force, not 43%. Agriculture's share in GDP in 1947 was 55%, not 15%.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                     Definition/Description
1.  Seigniorage                             :   Profit from money creation
2.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)         :   Compares prices of services in different countries
3.  Human Capital                           :   Investment in health and education
4.  Conservation Agriculture                :   Monoculture practices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Seigniorage accurately refers to the profit governments earn from money creation. Human capital correctly encompasses investments in health and education. However, PPP compares prices of a *basket of goods and services*, not just services, across countries. Conservation agriculture, on the contrary, *avoids* monoculture practices. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Rural Development Initiative/Concept    Key Element/Characteristic
1.  Integrated Farming System (IFS)       :   Reduced input costs
2.  Price Stabilization Fund (PSF)        :   Direct purchase from farmers
3.  SAMPADA                               :   Focus on marine processing only
4.  PM Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)   :   Doubling fishers' incomes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

IFS aims to reduce production costs through resource recycling and optimal utilization. The PSF promotes direct procurement from farmers to stabilize prices. PMMSY aims to double fishers’ and fish farmers’ incomes. However, SAMPADA's scope encompasses both agro and marine processing. Only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator/Concept            Interpretation/Significance
1.  Increase in NEER                     :   Rupee depreciation
2.  Increase in REER                     :   Improved trade competitiveness
3.  High capital-output ratio              :   Significant increase in output
4.  V-shaped recovery                    :   Sharp decline followed by sharp increase


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A V-shaped recovery accurately describes a sharp economic decline followed by a sharp increase. However, an increase in NEER indicates rupee *appreciation*, not depreciation. An increase in REER may not necessarily indicate improved trade competitiveness as it depends on several factors. A high capital-output ratio typically signifies *lower*, not significant, output increases. Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Issue/Challenge          Solution/Mitigation Strategy
1.  Low cropping intensity                 :   Enhancing irrigation access
2.  Inadequate linkage with processors    :   APMC Act reforms
3.  High production costs                 :   Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF)
4.  Yield loss during conversion to organic:   Government subsidies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Enhancing irrigation access directly addresses low cropping intensity. APMC Act reforms aim to improve linkages between farmers and processors. ZBNF is a strategy to reduce production costs.  Government subsidies can mitigate yield loss during conversion to organic farming.  All four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Agricultural Growth          Description
1. Improvement in crop productivity     :   Productivity of most crops below world average.
2. Improvement in livestock productivity :   Mixed farming system prevalent in India.
3. Increase in cropping intensity        :   Second crop taken on only 39% of net sown area.
4. Resource use efficiency              :   Improvement in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) contributes to cost savings.
5. Diversification towards high-value crops: Staple crops occupy 77% of gross cropped area but contribute only 41% of total output.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched with their respective descriptions based on the provided text. Let's examine each pair:

1. **Improvement in crop productivity:** The text explicitly states that the productivity of most crops in India is below the world average, highlighting a significant area for improvement in agricultural growth.

2. **Improvement in livestock productivity:** The passage clearly describes the prevalence of mixed farming systems in India, where crop and livestock production are integrated, indicating the importance of livestock in overall agricultural productivity.

3. **Increase in cropping intensity:** The text directly mentions that the second crop is cultivated on only 39% of the net sown area, indicating substantial untapped potential for increasing cropping intensity and agricultural output.

4. **Resource use efficiency:** The passage emphasizes the role of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) improvement in boosting output growth and reducing production costs, thereby enhancing the efficiency of resource utilization in agriculture.

5. **Diversification towards high-value crops:** The provided information shows that staple crops occupy a large portion (77%) of the gross cropped area, yet their contribution to total output is only 41%, while high-value crops contribute almost the same output value despite occupying a smaller area (19%). This disparity underscores the potential for improving farmers' income through diversification towards high-value crops.


Therefore, all five pairs accurately reflect aspects of agricultural growth strategies in India as detailed in the given text, making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit crucial elements of agricultural growth discussed in the source material.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Policy/Scheme              Key Feature
1. Agriculture Export Policy 2018        :   Aims to double agricultural exports by 2022.
2. Doubling Farmers’ Income by 2022   :   Requires strong linkages with manufacturing and service sectors.
3. National Agriculture Market scheme  :   Provides farmers access to a nationwide market.
4. Initiative for Nutritional Security   :   Aims to demonstrate improved production and post-harvest technologies.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately links a specific agricultural policy or scheme with its key objective or feature as described in the text.  Let's examine each one:

1. **Agriculture Export Policy 2018:** The policy explicitly aims to double agricultural exports, a crucial element for boosting farmer incomes.

2. **Doubling Farmers’ Income by 2022:** The text highlights that achieving this goal requires not only agricultural sector development but also strong integration with manufacturing and service sectors to create agricultural enterprises.

3. **National Agriculture Market scheme:**  The passage states that this scheme provides farmers access to a nationwide market, improving price realization and market reach.

4. **Initiative for Nutritional Security:** The description clearly states that this initiative focuses on demonstrating improved production, post-harvest technologies, and value addition techniques.

5. **National Bamboo Mission:** The text directly mentions that the mission aims for a holistic development of the bamboo sector, including increased cultivation and improved marketing of bamboo products.

All five pairs correctly match the policy/scheme with its key feature, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect, failing to encompass the full range of accurately paired items.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Farming System in India                    Characteristic
1. Primitive Subsistence Farming          :   Uses high doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation.
2. Intensive Subsistence Farming         :   Practiced on small patches of land with primitive tools.
3. Commercial Farming                     :   Single crop grown on a large area (plantation).
4. Plantation Farming                       :   Main characteristic is the use of HYV seeds and chemical fertilizers.
5. Mixed Farming                           :   Includes crop production, livestock, poultry, and fisheries.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. Let's analyze each:

1. **Primitive Subsistence Farming:** This is incorrectly paired. Primitive subsistence farming is characterized by small landholdings, primitive tools, and dependence on monsoon, not high inputs and irrigation as stated.  Intensive subsistence farming uses high inputs.

2. **Intensive Subsistence Farming:** This is incorrectly paired. Intensive subsistence farming is characterized by high population density and high inputs, not primitive tools.

3. **Commercial Farming:** This is correctly paired.  While the description doesn't explicitly mention plantations, commercial farming does include plantation agriculture as a type, where a single crop is grown on a large scale.

4. **Plantation Farming:** This is incorrectly paired. Plantation farming is a *type* of commercial farming, not a separate category with the characteristic of using HYV seeds and chemical fertilizers.  This is a characteristic of commercial farming in general.

5. **Mixed Farming:** This is correctly paired. The definition accurately describes mixed farming as integrating crop production with livestock, poultry, and fisheries.

Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are accurately matched, making option (b) the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include mismatched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Cropping Pattern               Description
1. Monocropping                           :   Growing two or more crops simultaneously.
2. Intercropping                           :   Growing two or more crops in quick succession.
3. Mixed Cropping                          :   Growing only one crop year after year.
4. Sequential Cropping                     :   Growing two or more crops simultaneously in alternate rows.
5. Relay Cropping                          :   Planting the succeeding crop before harvesting the preceding crop.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 5 is correctly matched. Let's examine each pair:

1. **Monocropping:** Incorrect. Monocropping involves growing a single crop repeatedly, not multiple crops simultaneously. This is the definition of multiple cropping.

2. **Intercropping:** Incorrect. Intercropping involves planting different crops in alternating rows, not growing crops in quick succession. This is the definition of sequential cropping.

3. **Mixed Cropping:** Incorrect. Mixed cropping involves growing multiple crops simultaneously without a specific row pattern, not growing only one crop. This is the definition of monocropping.

4. **Sequential Cropping:** Incorrect. Sequential cropping involves planting crops in succession, not simultaneously in alternate rows. This is the definition of intercropping.

5. **Relay Cropping:** Correct. The description accurately defines relay cropping as planting the next crop before harvesting the previous one.

Therefore, only pair 5 is correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrect pairings based on the definitions provided in the source text.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

3. Environmental Sustainability           :   Generates benefits for all stakeholders.
4. Integrated Farming System (IFS)        :   Multiple objectives of sustainability, food security, and poverty reduction.
5. Agroecology                            :  Farming that makes the best use of nature’s goods and services.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched.  Let's analyze:

1. **Economic Sustainability:** Incorrect. Economic sustainability is about generating benefits for all stakeholders, not equity in distribution (that's social sustainability).

2. **Social Sustainability:** Incorrect. Social sustainability concerns equitable distribution, not environmental impact (that's environmental sustainability).

3. **Environmental Sustainability:** Incorrect. Environmental sustainability focuses on minimizing negative environmental impacts, not generating benefits for stakeholders (that's economic sustainability).

4. **Integrated Farming System (IFS):** Correct. The text accurately describes IFS as having multiple objectives including sustainability, food security, and poverty reduction.

5. **Agroecology:** Correct. The description accurately defines agroecology as farming that utilizes natural resources without causing harm.

Therefore, only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain mismatched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Let's analyze:

1. **Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN):** Incorrect. PM-KISAN is an income support scheme for farmers, not related to credit-linked subsidies for food processing. That's a feature of the Scheme for Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises.

2. **Operation Greens (TOP):** Correct.  The scheme's objective is to improve the value chain for Tomato, Onion, and Potato farmers.

3. **Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan:** Incorrect.  Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan is a broader economic self-reliance initiative, not specifically focused on bamboo.  The National Bamboo Mission targets bamboo.

4. **National Bamboo Mission:** Correct. The mission aims for holistic growth of the bamboo sector.

5. **Scheme for Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises:** Incorrect. While price stabilization might be a *consequence*, the primary objective is to modernize and enhance the competitiveness of micro food processing units.  Operation Greens specifically targets TOP price stabilization.

Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

5. Integrated Farming System (IFS)           :   Enhances fertile landscapes and restores soil health.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Let's analyze:

1. **Drip Irrigation:** Incorrect. While drip irrigation can *reduce* water waste, the primary benefit mentioned in the text is not soil erosion reduction.  The text does not explicitly state drip irrigation reduces soil erosion.

2. **Conservation Agriculture (CA):** Correct. CA aims for higher productivity while minimizing environmental damage.

3. **Protected Cultivation:** Correct. Protected cultivation (polyhouses) helps produce disease-free transplants.

4. **Genetically Modified (GM) Crops:** Correct.  A key benefit of GM crops is increased resistance to pests and diseases.

5. **Integrated Farming System (IFS):** Correct. IFS aims to create a sustainable system that enhances soil health and biodiversity.

Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer. Option (a), (b), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.

3. Environment (Protection) Act 1986      :   Provides for the negotiability of warehouse receipts.
4. Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights (PPVFR) Act 2001: Grants breeders' rights.
5. Indian Patents Act 1970                :   Excludes patenting of seeds, plants, and their varieties.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Let's analyze:

1. **Warehousing (Development & Regulation) Act 2007:** Incorrect. This Act deals with warehousing and negotiable warehouse receipts, not GM crop regulation.  The Environment (Protection) Act 1986 and the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) regulate GM crops.

2. **Essential Commodities Act 1955:** Correct. This Act is used to regulate the prices of essential commodities, including Bt cotton seeds.

3. **Environment (Protection) Act 1986:** Incorrect. While related to environmental regulations, this Act doesn't directly deal with negotiable warehouse receipts. That's the function of the Warehousing (Development & Regulation) Act 2007.

4. **Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights (PPVFR) Act 2001:** Correct. This Act grants breeders' rights for plant varieties.

5. **Indian Patents Act 1970:** Correct.  The Act explicitly excludes patenting of seeds, plants, and their varieties.

Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrect pairing.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Intervention in Agriculture       Specific Policy Instrument
1. Ensuring Minimum Support Prices (MSP)     :   Operation Flood
2. Maintaining Buffer Stocks of Wheat and Rice :   Warehousing (Development & Regulation) Act, 2007
3. Distribution of Food Grains through PDS      :   Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)
4. Promoting Milk Cooperatives                 :   Essential Commodities Act, 1955

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because the pairs 1, 2, and 3 correctly match government interventions with their corresponding policy instruments.

1. **Ensuring Minimum Support Prices (MSP):**  The government's intervention to guarantee minimum support prices for agricultural products is a key policy instrument to protect farmers' income.  This is a direct mechanism for price support and doesn't involve any other specific program.

2. **Maintaining Buffer Stocks of Wheat and Rice:** The Food Corporation of India (FCI) plays a crucial role in maintaining buffer stocks of wheat and rice, a key strategy for food security and price stabilization. This is directly related to government intervention in managing grain supplies.

3. **Distribution of Food Grains through PDS:** The Public Distribution System (PDS) is a crucial government program that ensures the distribution of subsidized food grains to the poor and vulnerable sections of society. This is a direct form of government intervention in ensuring food access.

4. **Promoting Milk Cooperatives:** While the government supports the dairy sector, Operation Flood is the specific large-scale program that exemplifies the promotion of milk cooperatives. The Essential Commodities Act is not directly related to the promotion of milk cooperatives, though it deals with regulating essential commodities.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. Option (a) only includes the MSP, neglecting the important roles of buffer stocks and PDS. Option (b) correctly identifies buffer stocks and PDS but misses the MSP. Option (c) incorrectly links the Warehousing Act with MSP and includes the incorrect pairing of milk cooperatives with the Essential Commodities Act.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Rural Development Initiative                     Specific Aim
1.  Kudumbashree                               :   Promote thrift and credit societies for poor women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the primary aims of the respective rural development initiatives.

1. **Kudumbashree:** This Kerala-based program is explicitly designed to empower women through microfinance and savings mobilization, thereby facilitating financial inclusion and economic independence.

2. **Operation Greens:** This initiative focuses on the tomato, onion, and potato value chain, aiming to stabilize prices and reduce post-harvest losses, benefiting both producers and consumers.  The expansion to include other perishable goods is a later development.

3. **National Bamboo Mission:** The mission's core objective is to boost bamboo cultivation, particularly in the Northeast, promoting sustainable livelihoods and industrial development. The focus on the Northeast is a key element of this mission.

4. **Self-Help Groups (SHGs):** While SHGs contribute to rural development, their primary focus isn't on diversification of crops or workforce shifts. They primarily offer micro-credit and social support.  Diversification is a broader goal of rural development strategies, not a singular aim of SHGs.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either exclude correctly matched pairs (a) or include an incorrectly matched pair (c and d).  Option (d) incorrectly links SHGs with crop diversification and workforce shifts, which is a broader government strategy and not the main objective of SHGs themselves.


**3. With reference to agricultural marketing, consider the following pairs:**

   Marketing Channel                                   Characteristic
1.  Apni Mandi (Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan)     :   Regulated market yard
2.  Rythu Bazars (Andhra Pradesh)                :   Direct sale of produce to consumers
3.  e-NAM (electronic National Agriculture Market) :   Facilitates trading using warehouse receipts
4.  Mega Food Parks                               :   Provide cold chain infrastructure

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) because pairs 2, 3, and 4 correctly link marketing channels with their defining characteristics.

2. **Rythu Bazars (Andhra Pradesh):**  These are farmer's markets that facilitate direct sales from producers to consumers, eliminating intermediaries and enhancing farmers' income share.

3. **e-NAM (electronic National Agriculture Market):** This online platform leverages technology to streamline agricultural trading, enabling the use of electronic negotiable warehouse receipts (e-NWRs) for faster transactions and reduced logistical challenges.

4. **Mega Food Parks:** These integrated facilities are designed to improve the agricultural supply chain, including cold chain infrastructure for storage and distribution of perishable goods, boosting value addition and reducing waste.

1. **Apni Mandi (Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan):** While Apni Mandi aims to improve farmers' market access, it is not a regulated market yard in the traditional sense. They are alternative marketing channels, providing direct access to consumers but not under the same strict regulations as formal market yards.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs (a and b) or include an incorrectly matched pair (d), specifically the inaccurate pairing of Apni Mandi with regulated market yards.  Apni Mandi represents an alternative marketing system rather than a traditional regulated market yard.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                                      Primary Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)       :   Promote organic farming
2. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) :   Provide income support to farmers
3.  Operation Greens                                   :   Develop cold chain infrastructure

(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because pairs 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the primary objectives of the listed schemes.

2. **Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN):** This scheme directly provides financial assistance to eligible farmer families, aiming to supplement their income and improve their financial security.

3. **Operation Greens:** While having broader goals, a significant component of Operation Greens involves developing cold chain infrastructure to reduce post-harvest losses of perishable produce like tomatoes, onions, and potatoes.

4. **Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund:** This fund specifically targets improvements in livestock-related infrastructure, including processing and value addition facilities, ultimately enhancing livestock productivity and farmers' income from animal products.

1. **Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY):** This scheme provides crop insurance against various risks, not promoting organic farming directly. Organic farming is a separate agricultural practice.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair involving PMFBY and organic farming.  PMFBY focuses on risk mitigation through insurance rather than promoting specific farming methods.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                     Primary Aim
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana        :  Providing loans to poor farmers for cultivating specific crops
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme         :   To promote FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
3. Gold Monetization Scheme            :   To reduce India’s dependence on gold imports
4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme           :   Construction of family house and setting up of village cold storage facility

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing loans, not specifically to poor farmers for cultivating particular crops. Option 1 is incorrect.  The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme primarily aim to mobilize idle gold from households into the economy and reduce reliance on gold imports, respectively.  Option 2 is incorrect as it misattributes the aim of the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme. Option 3 is correct as it accurately reflects the aim of the Gold Monetization Scheme. Option 4 is incorrect; the Kisan Credit Card Scheme provides short-term credit for working capital, purchase of inputs, and post-harvest expenses, not for large-scale infrastructure projects like house construction or cold storage facility at the village level. Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly associate aims with schemes.  Understanding the nuances of these government schemes is crucial for analyzing India's economic policies and their impact on various sectors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                         Description
1. Merchant Discount Rate              :   The amount paid back by banks to their customers when they use debit cards
2. Legal Tender Money                   :   The bank money in the form of cheques, drafts, bills of exchange, etc.
3. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)        :    The amount that banks have to maintain in the form of their own funds to offset any loss that banks incur if the account-holders fail to repay dues
4. Money Multiplier                      :   Increases with an increase in the cash reserve ratio

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is the charge levied on merchants by banks for accepting payments through debit cards, not the amount paid back to customers. Option 1 is incorrect. Legal tender money refers to currency that a creditor is legally obligated to accept for settling debts, not just bank money in various forms. Option 2 is incorrect. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is indeed the amount banks maintain as their own funds to cover potential losses from non-repaying borrowers. Option 3 is correct. The money multiplier is inversely related to the cash reserve ratio; an increase in the cash reserve ratio decreases the money multiplier. Option 4 is incorrect.  Understanding these financial terms is crucial for analyzing the Indian banking system and monetary policy.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of core economic concepts and their precise definitions.



**3. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                      Characteristic

3. Call Money                               :   Short-term finance used for interbank transactions
4. Zero Coupon Bonds                       :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks to corporations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations, not a long-term instrument issued by the RBI. Option 1 is incorrect. Certificates of Deposit are short-term debt instruments issued by banks, not long-term instruments issued by the RBI to corporations. Option 2 is incorrect. Call money is indeed short-term finance used primarily for interbank transactions. Option 3 is correct. Zero-coupon bonds are not interest-bearing; they are sold at a discount and mature at face value. Option 4 is incorrect. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various financial instruments used in the Indian economy, focusing on their characteristics and issuers.  The incorrect options involve subtle but significant factual inaccuracies that would challenge a candidate with only superficial knowledge.


**4. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   FDI Component                          Description
1. Foreign currency convertible bonds   :  A largely non-debt creating capital flow
2. Foreign institutional investment      :  Investment through capital instruments essentially in a listed company
3. Global depository receipts             :  Investment made by foreign institutional investors in government securities
4. Non-resident external deposits       : Investment which involves debt-servicing

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency convertible bonds are a form of FDI that can be converted into equity, making it a non-debt creating capital flow. Option 1 is correct. Foreign institutional investment, while a significant part of the investment landscape, is not primarily characterized by direct investment through capital instruments in listed companies; it often involves portfolio investments. Option 2 is incorrect. Global depository receipts represent ownership in a foreign company, not direct investment in government securities. Option 3 is incorrect. Non-resident external deposits are not a direct investment and don't inherently involve debt servicing. Option 4 is incorrect. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the characteristics of different components of FDI in India.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's precise knowledge of FDI classifications.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mega Food Parks aim to link agricultural production to markets, encompassing a variety of food products, not just perishable goods. Option 1 is incorrect. Cold chain infrastructure is designed to provide integrated cold chain facilities throughout the supply chain, from farm to consumer, ensuring quality and reducing spoilage. Option 2 is correct. Warehouse receipts are used for various commodities, including agricultural produce and not only steel bars. Option 3 is incorrect.  Electronic Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (e-NWRs) allow for partial transfer or withdrawal of commodities, enhancing their flexibility. Option 4 is incorrect. The question tests the candidate's understanding of infrastructure and systems within the Indian food processing industry.  The distractors involve inaccuracies regarding the scope and functionality of the different components.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on polity and governance aspects related to agricultural policy and economic development in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Instrument                     Intended Outcome
1. Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for agricultural products :  To increase farmer income
2. Maintenance of buffer stocks of wheat and rice by FCI  : To ensure food security for the poor
3. Distribution of food grains and sugar through PDS      : To stabilize domestic agricultural commodity prices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

MSP aims to provide a safety net for farmers, ensuring they receive a minimum price for their produce, thereby contributing to their income.  Buffer stocks, maintained by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), are crucial for food security, especially during lean periods or emergencies, ensuring availability of essential commodities for the poor.  The Public Distribution System (PDS) aims to provide subsidized food grains and other essential commodities to the poor, improving their nutritional security.  However, PDS is not directly intended to stabilize domestic agricultural commodity prices; that's a broader market function influenced by various factors beyond just PDS.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Agriculture Export Policy 2018, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Objective                                 Specific Measure
1. Doubling agricultural exports by 2022            :  Implementing ad-hoc bans on onion exports
2. Diversifying export destinations                  : Creating inland transportation links for agricultural products
3. Promoting value-added agricultural exports      :  Imposing minimum export prices (MEP) for non-Basmati rice


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Agriculture Export Policy 2018 aimed to significantly increase agricultural exports and diversify the export basket.  Creating improved inland transportation links is directly relevant to achieving the objective of diversification of export destinations by enabling efficient movement of goods to ports and international markets.  However, implementing ad-hoc bans on onion exports or imposing MEPs on rice, while potentially serving short-term domestic goals, directly contradict the policy's long-term vision of a stable and predictable trade regime for boosting exports. These measures create uncertainty in the international market, harming India's image as a reliable supplier and hindering its export growth.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Growth in Agriculture              Mechanism
1. Improvement in livestock productivity         : Shifting cultivators from farm to non-farm occupations
2. Increase in cropping intensity                 : Enhancing access to irrigation
3. Resource use efficiency                        :  Diversification towards high-value crops


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Increasing cropping intensity directly relates to enhancing access to irrigation.  Improved irrigation allows farmers to cultivate more crops per year on the same land, thus increasing overall agricultural output.  However, improving livestock productivity is achieved through different means, such as better breeding practices, improved animal health, and better feed management, not by shifting labor to non-farm sectors.  Similarly, resource use efficiency involves optimizing input use, improving technology, and reducing costs, not through diversification into high-value crops, although that can be a contributing factor to overall farm income.


**4. With reference to challenges in the Indian agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Challenge                                   Underlying Factor
1. Low agricultural productivity in several crops   :  Variation in access to irrigation across states
2. Low cropping intensity                        :  Neglect of required reforms in the agriculture sector
3. Divergence in growth between agriculture and non-agriculture sectors :  Over-dependence of workforce on agriculture


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Variations in access to irrigation significantly impact crop yields across different states in India, leading to lower overall agricultural productivity compared to global averages.  Low cropping intensity is partly due to the lack of adequate irrigation facilities and technological advancements needed to cultivate more crops per year.  The divergence in growth rates between the agriculture and non-agriculture sectors since the 1990s is linked to the over-dependence of a large workforce on agriculture, leading to lower per-worker productivity in the agricultural sector compared to the non-agricultural sector. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Farming System                     Characteristic
1. Primitive Subsistence Farming              : High doses of biochemical inputs
2. Intensive Subsistence Farming              : Use of high-yielding variety (HYV) seeds
3. Commercial Farming                         : Dependence on monsoon rainfall


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Primitive subsistence farming is characterized by its reliance on traditional tools and minimal inputs, including a heavy dependence on monsoon rainfall. Intensive subsistence farming, while labour-intensive, uses higher doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation to maximize output from limited land. Commercial farming is indeed characterized by the use of HYV seeds, chemical fertilizers, and other modern inputs to achieve high productivity.  Therefore, none of the given pairs are correctly matched to their respective characteristics.


**6. With reference to sustainable food systems, consider the following pairs:**

    Dimension of Sustainability                     Key Indicator
1. Economic Sustainability                         :  Equity in distribution of economic value-added
2. Social Sustainability                            :  Neutral or positive environmental impacts
3. Environmental Sustainability                     :  Generation of economic value-added for all stakeholders


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Economic sustainability in a food system is measured by the generation of economic benefits for all stakeholders – farmers, workers, businesses, and consumers. Social sustainability focuses on equitable distribution of these benefits and positive social outcomes like improved nutrition and health. Environmental sustainability, however, is assessed through environmental impacts such as biodiversity conservation, water management, and carbon footprint reduction.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly interchange the indicators between social and economic sustainability.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Livestock Sector Aspect                        Impact on Farmers
1. Income Generation from milk sales             : Reduced risk mitigation strategies
2. Risk mitigation strategy in rain-fed areas    :  Increased reliance on chemical fertilizers
3. Provision of draught power for agriculture     :  Enhanced resource efficiency through mixed farming


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Livestock, particularly dairy animals, provide a significant source of subsidiary income for many farmers through milk sales.  In rain-fed areas, livestock act as a crucial risk mitigation strategy because even during crop failures, livestock can provide a source of income and food.  The use of livestock for draught power in agriculture contributes to enhanced resource efficiency in mixed farming systems. However, an increased reliance on chemical fertilizers is not a direct impact of livestock rearing; instead it's associated with intensive cropping practices.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 correctly match the aspect of livestock with its impact on farmers.



**8. With reference to alternative marketing channels for agricultural products, consider the following pairs:**

    Marketing Initiative                                  State/Region
1. Apni Mandi                                          : Andhra Pradesh
2. Rythu Bazars                                       : Punjab and Haryana
3. Uzhavar Sandies                                     : Tamil Nadu


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Uzhavar Sandies are farmer's markets found in Tamil Nadu. Apni Mandi is a farmer's market initiative primarily found in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. Rythu Bazars are farmer's markets in Andhra Pradesh. The other options incorrectly pair the initiatives with their states/regions.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Diversification Strategy                       Benefit
1. Diversification of crop production             :  Reduces risk from agriculture sector
2. Shift to non-farm employment                  :  Provides supplementary income during Rabi season
3. Promotion of horticulture                       :  Decreases reliance on monsoon rainfall


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Diversifying crop production reduces the risk associated with relying on a single crop, ensuring income even if one crop fails. Shifting to non-farm employment provides supplementary income, especially during periods like the Rabi season when agricultural work may be limited in some areas. However, while horticulture can reduce reliance on monsoon rainfall to some extent (through irrigation), it doesn't eliminate it entirely. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to the impact of the Green Revolution on the Indian agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Impact                                        Associated Consequence
1. Increased food production                      :  Increased dependence on chemical fertilizers
2. Improved farmer incomes                        :  Widespread water contamination
3. Enhanced agricultural productivity             :  Land degradation in some areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The Green Revolution led to a significant increase in food production in India. However, it also resulted in increased dependence on chemical fertilizers, leading to soil degradation and water contamination in many regions. While farmer incomes generally improved in some areas, the uneven distribution of benefits and the high cost of inputs also posed challenges.  Enhanced agricultural productivity was a major achievement, but it also came with environmental costs such as land degradation.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to environmental issues and sustainable development.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.

1. Village Society                               :   Processing and marketing of milk and products
2. District Union                                 :   Milk collection and quality testing
3. State Federation                              :   Overseeing the activities of district unions
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Village Society is responsible for milk collection and quality testing. The District Union processes and markets milk and products. The State Federation oversees the activities of district unions.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**10. With reference to the three-tier structure of Operation Flood, consider the following pairs:**

   Tier                                              Role
1. Village Cooperative Societies (DCS)              :   Marketing and distribution of dairy products to consumers
2. District Cooperative Milk Producers' Union      :   Procurement of milk from village societies
3. State Cooperative Milk Federation                :   Providing inputs and services to village societies
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Village Cooperative Societies (DCS) collect milk from producers, not market and distribute products. District Unions procure milk from village societies and process it, not only procure it. State Federations market and distribute the products, not provide inputs and services to DCSs. Therefore, only pair 2 correctly matches the role with the tier of the Operation Flood structure.  The other pairs describe functions that are distributed across multiple tiers, making them inaccurate as direct matches.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to the macroeconomic data.  Since the target content primarily deals with economic data, the framing of polity and governance questions requires inferential leaps and assumptions. The questions below attempt to connect the economic data to potential governance and policy implications.  It's important to note that these connections are interpretive and may not be explicitly stated in the provided text.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Year      |  Significant Macroeconomic Event (Inferred from Data)
------- | --------
1991-92  |  Substantial increase in NNP at factor cost, indicating economic recovery after a crisis.
1995-96  |  Sharp rise in indirect taxes, potentially reflecting a government policy shift toward revenue generation.
2003-04  |  Significant increase in government final consumption expenditure, possibly indicating increased public spending on infrastructure or social programs.
2004-05  |  Data unavailable for key macroeconomic aggregates, indicating potential gaps in data collection or reporting.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The substantial increase in NNP at factor cost from 1990-91 to 1991-92 strongly suggests an economic recovery, possibly following a period of economic slowdown or crisis.  The significant jump in indirect taxes in 1995-96 could be interpreted as a policy decision by the government to increase its revenue, perhaps to fund development projects or address fiscal deficits. The considerable rise in government final consumption expenditure in 2003-04 points towards a policy of increased public spending, which could reflect various government initiatives.  The absence of data for 2004-05 highlights a potential governance challenge related to data collection and reporting, suggesting possible weaknesses in the mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating economic performance.  Option (d) is incorrect because the missing data in 2004-05 represents a gap in information, not necessarily a specific macroeconomic event.


**2. With reference to India's macroeconomic aggregates, consider the following pairs:**

Indicator                     |   Potential Policy Implication (Inferred from Data)
-----------------------------|-------------------------------------
High Private Final Consumption Expenditure |  Potential for demand-pull inflation if not managed effectively.
Increasing Trend in Indirect Taxes |  Possible impact on price levels and consumer affordability.
High Capital-Output Ratio     |  Need for policy interventions to improve efficiency of investment.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

High private final consumption expenditure, if not balanced by sufficient production, can lead to demand-pull inflation. This implies a need for effective monetary and fiscal policies to manage aggregate demand.  A consistently increasing trend in indirect taxes can lead to higher prices for goods and services, potentially impacting consumer affordability and reducing purchasing power.  A high capital-output ratio suggests that the economy is not efficiently utilizing its investments to generate output.  This may indicate a need for policy reforms to improve productivity, technology adoption, or infrastructure development.  All three pairs demonstrate a clear link between macroeconomic indicators and potential policy implications related to fiscal and monetary management, inflation control, and investment efficiency.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Macroeconomic Variable        |   Type of Economic Policy Relevant for its Management
-----------------------------|-------------------------------------
Inflation                       |   Monetary Policy
Fiscal Deficit                  |   Fiscal Policy
Balance of Payments           |   Exchange Rate Policy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Inflation is primarily managed through monetary policy tools like interest rate adjustments, reserve requirements, and open market operations.  Fiscal deficit, which is the difference between government spending and revenue, is directly related to fiscal policy decisions concerning taxation, government expenditure, and public debt management.  The balance of payments, reflecting a country's international transactions, is significantly influenced by exchange rate policies aimed at maintaining currency stability and promoting international trade.  Therefore, all three pairs correctly connect macroeconomic variables with the appropriate types of economic policies used for their management.



**4. With reference to India's economic development, consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator             |  Potential Governance Challenge (Inferred from Data)
-----------------------------|-------------------------------------
High Unemployment              |   Need for effective employment generation policies and skill development programs.
Increasing Income Inequality   |   Requires policies to address wealth distribution and social safety nets.
Data Gaps in Macroeconomic Statistics |  Need for improved data collection mechanisms and transparency in reporting.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

High unemployment signifies a governance failure in providing sufficient employment opportunities, necessitating proactive policies to stimulate job creation and invest in skill development. Rising income inequality points towards a need for effective governance mechanisms to address wealth distribution, promote inclusive growth, and strengthen social safety nets for vulnerable populations. Inconsistent or missing macroeconomic data indicates weaknesses in data collection and reporting systems, hindering effective policy formulation and evaluation.  These gaps highlight the need for improved governance practices in data management and transparency.  All three pairs correctly link economic indicators with potential governance challenges and policy responses.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept                  |  Description
---------------------------------|------------------------------------
Nominal GDP                       | GDP measured at current market prices.
Real GDP                          | GDP adjusted for inflation.
NNP at Factor Cost (National Income) |  Total income earned by factors of production within a country's borders.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Nominal GDP uses current market prices, reflecting the total monetary value of goods and services produced without adjusting for inflation. Real GDP is adjusted for price changes, providing a more accurate representation of economic growth.  NNP at factor cost, also known as national income, represents the total income earned by the factors of production (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship) within a country's borders.  All three pairs accurately define the given macroeconomic concepts.  The definitions are fundamental to understanding macroeconomic data and analysis.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Environmental Issue                     Major Contributing Factor
1. Land Degradation                    :   Unsustainable fuelwood extraction
2. Biodiversity Loss                    :   Deforestation
3. Air Pollution (Urban)               :   Vehicular emissions
4. Freshwater Management Issues       :   Excess groundwater extraction
5. Solid Waste Management Challenges :   Affluent consumption standards

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Land degradation in India is significantly linked to unsustainable practices like fuelwood extraction, leading to soil erosion and nutrient depletion.  Deforestation directly contributes to biodiversity loss by destroying habitats and reducing species richness.  Vehicular emissions are a primary cause of air pollution, particularly in urban areas, impacting air quality and public health.  Over-extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other purposes creates freshwater management issues, leading to water scarcity and depletion of aquifers.  Finally, affluent consumption standards generate substantial amounts of solid waste, challenging waste management systems and creating environmental problems.  The options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. Option (c) is the only option that encompasses all correctly matched pairs, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of the environmental challenges in India.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of India's environmental problems and their root causes.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Resource Type                      Example
1. Renewable Resource              :   Petroleum
2. Non-Renewable Resource        :   Trees
3. Renewable Resource              :   Iron ore
4. Non-Renewable Resource        :   Coal
5. Renewable Resource              :   Water

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  Petroleum is a non-renewable resource, as its rate of formation is far slower than its consumption rate. Trees, when managed sustainably, are a renewable resource, capable of regrowth and replenishment. Iron ore is a non-renewable resource; while it can be recycled, its extraction from the earth is finite. Coal is a non-renewable resource, similar to petroleum. Water is generally considered a renewable resource through the water cycle, though unsustainable practices can deplete accessible freshwater sources.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair or include incorrectly matched pairs. Option (d) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating an understanding of the classification of natural resources.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to apply knowledge to classify resources.


**3. With reference to India's environmental concerns, consider the following pairs:**

Environmental Concern             Specific Example
1. Air Pollution                     :   Soil erosion
2. Water Contamination              :   Deforestation
3. Land Degradation                  :   Chemical pesticide overuse in agriculture
4. Biodiversity Loss                 :   Unsustainable fishing practices
5. Deforestation                     :   Overgrazing in arid and semi-arid regions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Chemical pesticide overuse in agriculture directly contributes to land degradation through soil contamination and loss of soil fertility. Unsustainable fishing practices, such as overfishing and destructive fishing methods, lead to biodiversity loss in aquatic ecosystems. Overgrazing, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, is a major cause of deforestation and land degradation.  Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrectly matched. Soil erosion is primarily associated with land degradation, while deforestation is more directly related to biodiversity loss.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs.  Option (c) accurately reflects the direct linkages between specific environmental concerns and their related examples, demonstrating an understanding of the interconnectedness of environmental issues in India. The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills to establish cause-and-effect relationships.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Indian Agricultural Policy Instrument            Objective
1. Minimum Support Price (MSP)                :   Reduce post-harvest losses
2. Government Stockpiling                     :   Stabilize food grain prices
3. Public Distribution System (PDS)             :   Ensure food security for the poor
4. Government Trading                          :   Promote value addition in agriculture
5. Agricultural Diversification                  :   Increase farmers' income


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  MSP aims to provide a minimum price guarantee to farmers, protecting their income. Government stockpiling helps stabilize food grain prices by regulating supply and demand. The PDS ensures food security for the poor through subsidized distribution of essential commodities. Agricultural diversification allows farmers to reduce dependence on single crops, increasing their income streams and overall resilience.  Pair 4 is incorrectly matched; government trading does not primarily focus on value addition, although it can be a contributing factor. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched ones. Option (d) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating an understanding of the objectives of key Indian agricultural policy instruments. This question tests factual recall and understanding of agricultural policies.


**5. With reference to India's rural development, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative/Program                                  Primary Goal
1. National Bamboo Mission                     :   Improve post-harvest management of bamboo
2. Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) :   Increase area under bamboo cultivation
3. Micro-credit programs                         :   Provide access to credit for small farmers
4. Self-Help Groups (SHGs)                      :   Enhance agricultural productivity through technology
5. Cooperative marketing systems                 :   Facilitate direct marketing by farmers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. The National Bamboo Mission aims to improve post-harvest management of bamboo, reducing losses and improving value addition. Micro-credit programs provide small farmers with access to credit, helping them overcome financial constraints.  Cooperative marketing systems enable farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers or processors, improving their market access and share of profits.  Pairs 2 and 4 are incorrectly matched. MIDH focuses on improving horticulture, not increasing bamboo cultivation.  SHGs primarily focus on providing microfinance and social support, not directly enhancing agricultural productivity. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones. Option (b) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating knowledge of rural development initiatives and their objectives. This question tests factual recall and understanding of rural development programs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Genetically Modified (GM) Crop Feature       Description
1.  Higher Yields                              :   Always leads to reduced pesticide use
2.  Resistance to Pests                        :   Always results in more nutritional value
3.  Longer Shelf Life                           :   Can reduce post-harvest losses
4.  More Nutritional Value                     :   Is always cost-effective for farmers
5.  Herbicide Tolerance                       :   Can lead to increased herbicide use


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.  Longer shelf life in GM crops directly reduces post-harvest losses. Herbicide tolerance in GM crops can lead to increased herbicide use as farmers rely on it to control weeds, potentially harming the environment. The other pairs are incorrectly matched. Higher yields do not always guarantee reduced pesticide use; increased yields can sometimes lead to increased pest pressure. Pest resistance doesn't always mean increased nutritional value. Longer shelf life is not always cost-effective for farmers, and more nutritional value is not always cost-effective either. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. Option (b) accurately identifies the only two correctly matched pairs, demonstrating an understanding of the complex and nuanced aspects of GM crops and their potential impacts. This question assesses the ability to critically evaluate claims about GM crop features.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to economic development.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator                      Condition for Higher Economic Development
1. Increase in absolute real GNP         :   Poverty and unemployment decrease
2. Increase in per capita real GNP      :   Agricultural output keeps pace with industrial output
3. High savings economy                 :   Low capital-output ratio

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Increases in absolute and per capita real GNP do not guarantee higher economic development if poverty and unemployment remain high (option 1 is incorrect).  Similarly, a high savings economy might not translate to significant output increases if the capital-output ratio is high, meaning it takes a large investment to produce a small amount of output (option 3 is incorrect). Only the pairing of increased per capita real GNP with agricultural output keeping pace with industrial output aligns with the balanced growth needed for true economic development (option 2 is correct). Option (c) correctly identifies this.  A rise in per capita income is meaningful only when it leads to improved living standards and economic opportunities, and this requires a balanced growth across sectors.


**2. With reference to economic indicators, consider the following pairs:**

Indicator                                    Characteristic
1. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates :   Based on comparing prices of a basket of goods across nations.
2. India's ranking by PPP dollars           :    Fifth largest economy globally
3. Consumer Price Index (CPI)                    :   Lower weightage for food than Wholesale Price Index (WPI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries (option 1 is correct).  However, India's ranking according to PPP is not the fifth largest but the sixth largest economy globally (option 2 is incorrect).  Furthermore, the CPI gives a higher weightage to food compared to the WPI, reflecting the importance of food in household budgets (option 3 is incorrect).  Therefore, only option 1 is correctly matched. The incorrect options highlight the importance of precise knowledge of economic indicators and their current values for accurate analysis.


**3. With reference to macroeconomic indicators and policies, consider the following pairs:**

Indicator/Policy                          Effect/Characteristic
1. Increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   Indicates rupee depreciation
2. Increase in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)  :   Indicates improved trade competitiveness
3. Increasing domestic inflation relative to other countries : Causes increasing divergence between NEER and REER.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

An increase in NEER actually reflects rupee appreciation, not depreciation (option 1 is incorrect).  An increase in REER does indicate an improvement in a country's trade competitiveness, as its goods become relatively cheaper (option 2 is correct). A widening gap between NEER and REER is indeed a consequence of a rising domestic inflation rate compared to inflation in other countries (option 3 is correct). Therefore, options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of exchange rate indicators and their implications for a country's economic health.


**4. With reference to market demand, consider the following pairs:**

Situation                                   Effect on Market Demand
1. Price of a substitute good increases      :   Market demand for the original good decreases
2. Price of a complement good increases       :   Market demand for the original good decreases
3. Income increases, good is inferior          :   Market demand for the original good decreases

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper original good, thus increasing its market demand (option 1 is incorrect). If the price of a complement good increases, the demand for the original good which is used together with the complement good will decrease (option 2 is correct).  If income increases and the good is inferior, the demand for the good will fall because consumers can afford to buy superior goods (option 3 is correct).  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of basic economic principles related to demand and its determinants.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Scheme/Policy                    Primary Aim
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana            :   Providing pensions to the elderly
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme              :   Boosting FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
3. Gold Monetization Scheme                :   Reducing India’s dependence on gold imports

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana aims at bringing small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system, not providing pensions (option 1 is incorrect). The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme are indeed aimed at mobilizing idle gold held by households and reducing India's dependence on gold imports (options 2 and 3 are correct).  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question assesses knowledge of government schemes and their objectives, a crucial element of governance and economic policy.


**6. With reference to financial instruments, consider the following pairs:**

Instrument                                     Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                           :   Long-term unsecured promissory note
2. Certificate of Deposit                       :   Short-term instrument issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks
3. Call Money                                   :   Long-term finance used for interbank transactions
4. Zero Coupon Bonds                           :  Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note, not long-term (option 1 is incorrect). Certificates of Deposit are short-term instruments issued by banks, not long-term (option 2 is incorrect). Call money is short-term finance used for interbank transactions, not long-term (option 3 is incorrect). Zero coupon bonds are not interest-bearing; they are sold at a discount and mature at face value (option 4 is incorrect). Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of various financial instruments and their characteristics, crucial for analyzing financial markets and policy.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Financial Institution/Policy                  Function/Characteristic
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor    :   Appointed by State Governments
2. RBI's power source                      :   The Constitution of India
3.  RBI's role with government securities :   Manages and services both central and state government securities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RBI Governor is appointed by the Central Government, not State Governments (option 1 is incorrect). The RBI's power primarily comes from the RBI Act, not solely the Constitution (option 2 is incorrect). The RBI manages and services central government securities, but not necessarily state government securities (option 3 is incorrect). Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This demonstrates the need for precise understanding of the institutional structure and functions of the RBI within the Indian financial system.


**8. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks in India, consider the following pairs:**

Feature                                       Status
1. Supervision and Regulation              :   By local boards set up by the Central Government
2. Issuance of equity and preference shares:   Permitted
3. Brought under Banking Regulation Act, 1949:   Through an amendment in 1991

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Urban Cooperative Banks are supervised and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, not local boards set up by State Governments (option 1 is incorrect). They are indeed permitted to issue equity and preference shares (option 2 is correct). They were brought under the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 through an amendment in 1966, not 1991 (option 3 is incorrect). Therefore, only option 2 is correctly matched.  This question assesses knowledge about the regulatory framework governing Urban Cooperative Banks.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

Factor                                     Influence on Indian Government Bond Yields
1. Actions of the United States Federal Reserve :   Minimal influence
2. Actions of the Reserve Bank of India         :   Significant influence
3. Inflation and short-term interest rates       :   Significant influence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While global factors can indirectly influence Indian bond yields, the actions of the US Federal Reserve have a more indirect and less direct impact compared to domestic factors (option 1 is incorrect). The RBI's actions, through monetary policy tools, directly affect bond yields (option 2 is correct).  Inflation and short-term interest rates are key determinants of bond yields, reflecting risk and opportunity cost (option 3 is correct).  Therefore, options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests understanding of factors influencing bond markets, crucial for analyzing macroeconomic policy.


**10. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following pairs:**

Investment Type                                Characteristic
1. Foreign currency convertible bonds         :   Included in FDI
2. Foreign institutional investment with conditions :   Included in FDI
3. Global depository receipts                  :   Included in FDI
4. Non-resident external deposits             :   Not included in FDI

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency convertible bonds are considered a form of foreign portfolio investment, not FDI (option 1 is incorrect). Foreign institutional investment with certain conditions and global depository receipts are generally considered part of FDI, depending on the specific conditions (option 2 and 3 are correct).  Non-resident external deposits are short-term investments, not FDI (option 4 is correct). Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests understanding of FDI, a key component of India's economic strategy.  The nuances of classification highlight the importance of precise knowledge.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

Effect of Currency Devaluation                Outcome
1. Improves competitiveness of domestic exports:   Always true
2. Increases the foreign value of domestic currency:  Never true
3. Improves the trade balance                  :   Not necessarily true

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Devaluation makes domestic goods cheaper for foreign buyers, improving export competitiveness (option 1 is correct).  Devaluation, by definition, reduces the foreign value of the domestic currency (option 2 is incorrect). While devaluation aims to improve the trade balance, the effect is not guaranteed; it depends on various factors like price elasticity of demand and supply (option 3 is incorrect). Therefore, only option 1 is correctly matched.  This question tests understanding of the effects of exchange rate policies, crucial for international trade and economic management.



**12. With reference to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

Policy/Factor                                   Effect
1. Expansionary policies                       :   Increases demand-pull inflation
2. Fiscal stimulus                             :   Increases demand-pull inflation
3. Inflation-indexing wages                     :   Increases demand-pull inflation
4. Higher purchasing power                     :   Increases demand-pull inflation
5. Rising interest rates                         :   Decreases demand-pull inflation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies increase aggregate demand, contributing to demand-pull inflation (options 1 and 2 are correct). Inflation-indexing wages increases disposable income and spending, further fueling demand-pull inflation (option 3 is correct). Higher purchasing power directly boosts aggregate demand, leading to increased inflation (option 4 is correct). Rising interest rates, however, reduce borrowing and spending, thus curbing demand-pull inflation (option 5 is incorrect). Therefore, options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests understanding of the causes and consequences of inflation, crucial for macroeconomic management.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop Growing Season       :   Season
1.  Rice                     :   Rabi Season
2.  Wheat                    :   Kharif Season
3.  Mustard                  :   Zaid Season
4.  Soybean                 :   Kharif Season


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because only soybean is a Kharif crop.  Rice is primarily a Kharif crop, while wheat is a Rabi crop.  Mustard can be grown in the Zaid season, but it is not exclusively a Zaid crop; it’s more common in the Rabi season.  The Zaid season is a short cropping season between the Kharif and Rabi seasons.  Understanding the cropping seasons and the crops associated with each is crucial for analyzing agricultural production patterns and policies in India. The other options incorrectly associate crops with the wrong seasons, showcasing a common misconception in agricultural knowledge. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly pair at least one crop with an inappropriate season, highlighting the importance of precise factual knowledge in this area.


**2. With reference to sources of growth in Indian agriculture, consider the following pairs:**

   Growth Source                    :  Description
1. Improvement in livestock productivity :  Mixed farming systems are inefficient in resource utilization
2. Increase in cropping intensity       :   Second crops are cultivated on more than 60% of net sown area
3. Resource use efficiency              :   Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth is unrelated to cost savings
4. Diversification towards high-value crops:  Staple crops occupy a smaller percentage of gross cropped area than high-value crops


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because only the statement related to diversification towards high-value crops is accurate. High-value crops (fruits, vegetables, etc.) contribute almost the same value of output as staple crops despite occupying a smaller percentage of the gross cropped area. The other options present inaccurate information. Mixed farming systems in India are designed for resource efficiency. The second crop is cultivated on less than 40% of the net sown area, and TFP growth directly contributes to cost savings.  This question tests the understanding of the factors driving agricultural growth and the ability to identify accurate statements from a set of plausible but incorrect alternatives.  The incorrect options highlight common misconceptions about the realities of Indian agriculture, demanding a nuanced understanding of the sector's dynamics.


**3.  With reference to the Agriculture Export Policy 2018, consider the following pairs:**

  Policy Aim                        :  Specific Measure
1. Stable Trade Policy Regime       :   Frequent ad-hoc bans on onion exports
2. Infrastructure and Logistics      :   Reducing logistics costs to 8-9% of export costs
3. Cluster Development              :   Promoting standardization of horticultural products


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The Agriculture Export Policy 2018 aims for cluster development to ensure sufficient volumes of high-quality produce with standard parameters. Frequent ad-hoc bans contradict the goal of a stable trade policy regime. While the policy aims to improve logistics, reducing costs to 8-9% is aspirational, not a specific implemented measure.  This question tests knowledge of specific policy details and the ability to link policy aims with actual measures. The distractors highlight potential misunderstandings regarding the policy's goals and implementation strategies, requiring a precise understanding of the policy document itself.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Dairy Cooperative Program   :    Key Feature
1. Operation Flood              :   Primarily focused on increasing urban milk consumption
2. Amul (KDCMPUL)             :    Started with two cooperative societies and 247 liters of milk
3. Three-tier structure          :    Direct milk procurement from individual farmers is absent


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Amul's inception indeed began with a small scale, highlighting the organic growth of the cooperative. Operation Flood aimed to increase milk production and augment rural incomes, while the three-tier structure (village society, district union, state federation) is integral to the success of the cooperative model by ensuring direct procurement from farmers.  This question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between the core features of various dairy cooperative programs.  The distractors include partially true statements or those that misrepresent the actual operations of the programs, emphasizing the need for a precise understanding of the details.


**5. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following pairs:**

  Aspect of MSP                     :  Characteristic
1. Legal Backing                    :   Farmers can legally demand MSP
2. CACP’s Role                     :   Recommends MSPs for 23 commodities
3. Cost of Production Calculation   :   Solely uses A2 cost method


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correct. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) does recommend MSPs for 23 commodities.  MSP lacks legal backing, meaning farmers cannot legally demand it.  The cost of production is calculated using A2, A2+FL, and C2 methods, not solely A2. This question tests the understanding of the MSP mechanism in India, including its legal status, the role of the CACP, and the methods used to calculate the cost of production. The incorrect options represent potential misconceptions about the MSP system, underscoring the importance of detailed knowledge in this area of agricultural policy.


**6.  With reference to fertilizer subsidies in India, consider the following pairs:**

  Fertilizer Type              :   Subsidy Mechanism
1. Urea                       :   Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS)
2. DAP and MOP                :   Price regulation by the government
3. Nano Urea                   :   Currently receives government subsidy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Urea subsidy is based on a different mechanism than NBS. DAP and MOP prices are not regulated; they are market-driven with a fixed nutrient subsidy. Nano Urea does not currently receive government subsidies. This question assesses detailed knowledge of fertilizer subsidy mechanisms in India and the ability to differentiate between various types of subsidies.  The incorrect options represent common misunderstandings about the intricacies of India's fertilizer subsidy system.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sector                     :  Employment Characteristic in India
1. Primary Sector             :   Employs a majority of female workers
2. Secondary Sector           :   Shows a consistently higher growth rate than the primary sector
3. Service Sector              :   Primarily concentrated in rural areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched. The primary sector (agriculture) employs a significantly larger proportion of female workers compared to other sectors. The growth rate of the secondary and tertiary sectors has fluctuated and sometimes surpassed the growth rate of the primary sector over time. The service sector is more dominant in urban areas. This question assesses the understanding of employment trends across different sectors in India, highlighting the sectoral distribution of the workforce and the gender dynamics within those sectors.  The incorrect options reveal common misconceptions regarding the relative growth rates of sectors and their geographical distribution, demonstrating the need for precise factual knowledge.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on polity and governance aspects related to rural development and economic policies.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.

   **Government Scheme**                   **Primary Aim**
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana           :   Providing pension to old and destitute persons
2. Kisan Credit Card Scheme               :   Construction of family houses for farmers
3. Operation Flood                       :   Promoting FDI in the dairy sector
4. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme            :   Reducing India's dependence on gold imports


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing loans.  The Kisan Credit Card Scheme provides short-term credit support to farmers for various agricultural needs, not for house construction. Operation Flood was a program to boost milk production and distribution through cooperatives, not to attract FDI. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme aims to reduce India's reliance on gold imports by mobilizing domestic gold reserves. Therefore, only statement 4 is correctly matched.  The other options present incorrect pairings, highlighting potential misconceptions about the schemes' objectives.


**2. With reference to agricultural marketing in India, consider the following pairs:**

   **Marketing Channel**                  **State/Region**
1. Apni Mandi                           :   Andhra Pradesh
2. Rythu Bazars                          :   Punjab
3. Uzhavar Sandies                       :   Tamil Nadu
4. Hadaspar Mandi                       :   Gujarat


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Apni Mandi is a direct marketing system primarily operating in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. Rythu Bazars are farmer's markets found in Andhra Pradesh. Uzhavar Sandies are farmers' markets established in Tamil Nadu. Hadaspar Mandi is a regulated market yard located in Pune, Maharashtra.  Only the pairing of Uzhavar Sandies with Tamil Nadu is correct. The other options contain incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's knowledge of alternative marketing channels and their geographical distribution.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Irrigation Source**                    **Dominant Region**
1. Canals                               :   Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
2. Wells                                 :   Peninsular Plateau (Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu)
3. Tubewells                             :   Indo-Gangetic Plain
4. Tanks                                :   North-Western Rajasthan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While canals are a significant irrigation source across northern India, including parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, wells are more prevalent in regions with ample groundwater. Tubewells are indeed common in the Indo-Gangetic plain due to its geological characteristics. Tanks are primarily found in the peninsular plateau region.  The Indira Gandhi Canal, a major canal system, serves North-Western Rajasthan.  Only the pairing of tubewells with the Indo-Gangetic plain is entirely accurate.  The other options demonstrate incorrect regional associations with irrigation methods, testing the candidate's understanding of India's diverse geography and its impact on agricultural practices.


**4. With reference to India's environmental challenges, consider the following pairs:**

   **Environmental Issue**                   **Major Contributing Factor**
1. Land Degradation                       :   Unsustainable fuelwood extraction
2. Biodiversity Loss                       :   Excess felling of forests
3. Air Pollution (Urban Areas)           :   Industrial emissions only
4. Water Contamination                    :   Improper irrigation management


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Land degradation is significantly linked to unsustainable fuelwood extraction, overgrazing, and deforestation. Biodiversity loss is directly impacted by excessive deforestation and habitat destruction. Air pollution in urban areas stems from both vehicular and industrial emissions. Water contamination is exacerbated by improper irrigation practices, leading to runoff and water pollution. Only statement 3 is partially incorrect because it omits vehicular emissions as a key contributor to urban air pollution. Option (b) correctly identifies the links between land degradation, biodiversity loss, and water contamination with their major contributing factors.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Economic Policy/Initiative**         **Primary Objective**
1. Minimum Support Price (MSP)          :   Increase in foreign exchange reserves
2. Disinvestment of PSUs                :   Curbing tax evasion
3.  WTO Membership                      :   Promoting agricultural exports
4.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)      :   Boosting domestic industries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Minimum Support Prices (MSP) aim to protect farmers' incomes, not to increase foreign exchange reserves. Disinvestment of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) aims to improve government finances, not necessarily to curb tax evasion.  India's WTO membership aims to increase trade and integration into the global economy, including agricultural exports. FDI aims to attract foreign capital and technology, thereby boosting domestic industries. Only the pairing of WTO membership with its primary objective is fully accurate. The other options present incorrect or incomplete descriptions of the policies' primary aims, testing the candidate's understanding of India's economic policies and their intended goals.


**6. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   **Financial Instrument**                **Description**
1. Commercial Paper                     :   Long-term instrument issued by the RBI
2. Certificate of Deposit                 :   Short-term unsecured promissory note
3. Call Money                             :   Short-term finance for interbank transactions
4. Zero Coupon Bonds                     :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations. Certificates of deposit are short-term to medium-term instruments issued by banks. Call money is indeed short-term finance used for interbank transactions. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest but are sold at a discount and mature at face value.  Only the description of call money is entirely correct.  The other options contain incorrect characterizations of financial instruments, testing the candidate's understanding of financial market terminology and instruments.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Economic Concept**                     **Description**
1. Demand-pull inflation                   :   Caused by rising interest rates
2. Money Multiplier                        :   Increases with higher cash reserve ratio
3. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)           :   Decided by each individual bank
4. Legal Tender Money                      :   Metallic money only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation is caused by excess aggregate demand, not rising interest rates. The money multiplier is inversely related to the cash reserve ratio. CAR is set by regulatory bodies, not individual banks. Legal tender money includes banknotes and coins, not just metallic money.  None of the provided pairs are correctly matched. All options present incorrect descriptions of economic concepts, testing the candidate's understanding of macroeconomic principles and their definitions.  This question tests for factual recall and conceptual understanding.


**8. With reference to  India’s financial sector, consider the following pairs:**

   **Institution/Scheme**                  **Function/Characteristic**
1. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :  Supervises and regulates Urban Cooperative Banks
2. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :   Issues Certificate of Deposit
3. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)              :   Primarily focus on large corporate lending
4.  RuPay                                  :   A card payment scheme launched by NPCI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NPCI facilitates various payment systems, not the supervision of Urban Cooperative Banks. The RBI is involved in monetary policy and regulation, including issuing various financial instruments. Small Finance Banks (SFBs) cater to small businesses and farmers, not large corporates.  RuPay is a card payment scheme launched by NPCI. Only the pairing of RuPay with its function is entirely accurate. The other options contain incorrect or incomplete descriptions of institutions and their functions, testing the candidate's knowledge of India's financial system and its key players.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Factor Affecting Indian Rupee**       **Impact**
1. Curbing imports of non-essential goods :   Weakening of the Indian Rupee
2. Encouraging Masala Bonds               :   Strengthening of the Indian Rupee
3. Easing external commercial borrowing :   Weakening of the Indian Rupee
4. Expansionary monetary policy           :   Strengthening of the Indian Rupee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Curbing imports and promoting exports generally strengthens a currency. Issuing rupee-denominated Masala Bonds attracts foreign investment, thus strengthening the rupee. Easing external commercial borrowing can lead to increased demand for foreign currency, weakening the rupee. Expansionary monetary policy can lead to inflation and potentially weaken the currency. Only the pairing of encouraging Masala Bonds with its impact on the rupee is fully correct.  The other options contain incorrect assessments of the policies' impacts on the currency's value, testing the candidate's understanding of exchange rate mechanisms and macroeconomic policies.



**10. With reference to the factors contributing to India's economic growth, consider the following pairs:**

   **Sector**                              **Contribution**
1. Agriculture                           :   Consistent high growth rates throughout the reform period
2. Industry                              :   Slowdown due to cheaper imports
3. Service Sector                         :   Major driver of growth in the reform period
4. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)        :   Minimal impact on economic growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While agriculture has shown growth, it hasn't been consistently high throughout the reform period. The industrial sector experienced a slowdown due to various factors, including cheaper imports. The service sector has indeed been a major driver of growth. FDI has had a significant positive impact on economic growth. Only the pairing of the service sector with its contribution is entirely accurate. The other options contain incorrect or incomplete descriptions of the sectors' contributions to economic growth, testing the candidate's understanding of India's economic structure and its evolution during the reform period.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Phase of Green Revolution                 Characteristic
1. First Phase (mid-1960s to mid-1970s) : Primarily benefited rice-growing regions
2. Second Phase (mid-1970s to mid-1980s):  Spread to a larger number of states
3. Second Phase (mid-1970s to mid-1980s):  HYV technology restricted to affluent states

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The first phase of the Green Revolution, from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, focused primarily on wheat-growing regions, particularly in Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.  The text explicitly mentions that the use of HYV seeds was restricted to more affluent states during this period. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The second phase, spanning the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, saw a significant expansion of HYV technology across a wider range of states and crops. This aligns perfectly with pair 2. Pair 3 is incorrect because the restriction of HYV technology to affluent states was characteristic of the *first*, not the second, phase. Thus, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the phases of the Green Revolution.  A deeper understanding is needed to differentiate the characteristics of each phase.


**2.  With reference to the Green Revolution's impact, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Outcome                       Associated Effect
1. Marketed surplus increased             :  Food grain prices relative to other goods increased
2. Food grain production increased        :  India achieved self-sufficiency in food grains
3.  Government procured food grains     :  Risk of small farmers being ruined by pest attacks increased

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Green Revolution led to a significant increase in marketed surplus of rice and wheat, resulting in a *decline*, not an increase, in the price of food grains relative to other goods.  This directly contradicts pair 1.  The increased food grain production did, however, enable India to achieve self-sufficiency in food grains, making pair 2 correct.  Pair 3 is incorrect as the government's procurement of food grains and the establishment of research institutes actually *reduced* the risk of small farmers being ruined by pests.  The question assesses the ability to analyze the complex economic effects of the Green Revolution, distinguishing between direct and indirect consequences and identifying plausible distractors.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Intervention in Agriculture      Intended Outcome
1. Low-interest loans to small farmers     : Decreased agricultural output
2. Subsidised fertilisers                   : Reduced inequality between rich and poor farmers
3.  Phased out subsidies                   : Increased risk for farmers adopting new technology

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Low-interest loans and subsidized fertilizers were government interventions aimed at enabling small farmers to access the inputs necessary for the Green Revolution. These measures were intended to *increase* agricultural output and reduce the inequality between rich and poor farmers.  Thus, pair 1 is incorrect.  Pair 2 accurately reflects the government's goal of reducing inequality.  Pair 3 is also correct; the removal of subsidies would indeed increase the risk for farmers, particularly small farmers, as they would have to bear the full cost of inputs. The question assesses the ability to evaluate the effectiveness and intentions behind government policies aimed at supporting farmers.  It requires the candidate to understand the potential consequences of both providing and removing subsidies.


**4. With reference to agricultural subsidies, consider the following pairs:**

   Argument for Subsidies                     Supporting Point
1.  Incentivize adoption of HYV technology :  Subsidies benefit only the poor farmers
2.  Farming in India is a risky business     :  Subsidies should be phased out once technology is profitable
3.  Protect poor farmers from high input costs:  Subsidies disproportionately benefit the fertilizer industry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The argument that subsidies are necessary to incentivize the adoption of new technologies is supported by the fact that farmers perceive new technologies as risky.  However, the statement that subsidies benefit *only* the poor farmers is incorrect, as a substantial portion of subsidies benefits larger farmers and the fertilizer industry. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The argument for phasing out subsidies once the technology becomes profitable is a valid economic viewpoint, but it contradicts the premise that farming remains a risky business, making pair 2 incorrect. Pair 3 is correct; the text explicitly states that a substantial portion of fertilizer subsidies benefits the fertilizer industry. The question tests the ability to analyze arguments for and against agricultural subsidies, identifying logical fallacies and biases within the arguments.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy (1950-1990), consider the following pairs:**

   Sector                                  Characteristic
1. Agriculture                             :  Employs a large proportion of the population despite productivity increases
2. Industrial sector                        :  Absorbed a significant portion of the agricultural workforce
3. Service sector                           :  Remained a minor contributor to GDP throughout the period


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text highlights that despite growth in agricultural output, a large proportion of the population remained employed in agriculture due to a lack of absorption in other sectors. This makes pair 1 correct.  Pair 2 is incorrect; the industrial and service sectors failed to absorb the surplus labor from agriculture. Pair 3 is also incorrect; the service sector's contribution to GDP did increase over time. The question assesses conceptual understanding of structural issues in the Indian economy during a specific period, requiring the candidate to analyze the relationship between different sectors and employment patterns. The options are designed to test the candidate's ability to critically evaluate economic data and identify the correct match.


**6.  With reference to the Indian economy post-independence, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Act                                   Consequence
1. License Raj                               : Promoted competition and entrepreneurship
2. MRTP Act 1969                             : Enabled Indian firms to achieve economies of scale
3. Reservation for small-scale industries   : Led to technological backwardness in some sectors

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The License Raj, with its complex regulations and bureaucratic hurdles, actually *hindered* competition and entrepreneurship, making pair 1 incorrect.  The MRTP Act, by restricting the expansion of large businesses, prevented Indian firms from achieving economies of scale, contradicting pair 2.  Pair 3 is correct; the reservation policies for small-scale industries, while aiming to promote employment, contributed to technological backwardness in certain sectors due to limited access to capital and technology for small firms.  The question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the long-term consequences of various economic policies adopted in India, requiring an understanding of the historical context and their impact on industrial development.  The closely related but incorrect options test the candidate's depth of knowledge.

These MCQs aim to test a broad range of knowledge related to Indian agriculture, geography, and government policies, reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of the UPSC examination.  They incorporate plausible distractors to make the questions challenging and demand precise factual recall alongside conceptual understanding.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Polity and Governance aspects related to agriculture, drawing parallels from the given source material.  Note that the difficulty level is intentionally high, incorporating plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Policy/Scheme                        Associated Goal/Focus
1.  PM-KISAN                           :   Boosting agricultural exports to $100 billion
2.  Agriculture Export Policy 2018     :   Providing income support to farmers
3.  National Bamboo Mission          :   Promoting holistic growth of the bamboo sector
4.  Minimum Support Price (MSP)      :   Increasing cropping intensity by 60%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PM-KISAN (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi) scheme aims to provide income support to small and marginal farmers, not directly focused on export targets.  The Agriculture Export Policy 2018, as its name suggests, focuses on boosting agricultural exports. The National Bamboo Mission aims at holistic growth of the bamboo sector, including cultivation and marketing. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism aims to ensure a minimum price for certain agricultural products to support farmers' income, not directly related to increasing cropping intensity. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to agricultural policies and their impact, consider the following pairs:**

Policy/Intervention                      Potential Negative Consequence
1.  High MSPs                             :   Increased diversification of crops
2.  Cost-plus pricing of MSPs             :   Distortions in market cropping patterns
3.  Extensive use of GM crops            :   Reduced dependence on chemical fertilizers
4.  Government procurement at MSP       :   Deterioration in soil quality due to monoculture

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

High MSPs, while intending to support farmers, can lead to market distortions and discourage diversification as farmers may focus on subsidized crops.  Cost-plus pricing for MSPs ignores market dynamics and can create price imbalances and affect cropping patterns.  Extensive use of GM crops can, in some cases, lead to increased herbicide use and potential environmental and health concerns, not necessarily reduced fertilizer dependence. Government procurement at MSP, concentrated on a few crops in specific regions, can lead to monoculture and subsequent soil degradation. Hence, only pairs 2 and 4 accurately reflect potential negative consequences.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Body/Organization            Key Function/Responsibility
1.  Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP)   :   Recommending Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane
2.  Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution:  Recommending MSPs for agricultural commodities
3.  Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)     :   Regulating GM crops in India
4.  TRIFED                               :   Procurement of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) at MSP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CACP recommends MSPs for various agricultural commodities, not just FRP for sugarcane. The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution plays a role in food distribution but doesn't primarily recommend MSPs. The GEAC is responsible for regulating GM crops. TRIFED is indeed involved in the procurement of MFPs at MSP. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Indian food processing industry, consider the following pairs:**

Industry Segment                      Challenge Faced

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched based on the provided text.  Human capital formation encompasses investments in various aspects of human development, including education, health, training, migration, and information acquisition.  MSP is a government-announced price floor for agricultural products, aiming to protect farmers' income. The Pink Revolution refers specifically to the modernization of the meat and poultry processing sector.  A2 cost of production accurately reflects the paid-out expenses of farmers, while C2 cost of production further incorporates imputed costs like rentals and forgone interest. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to Indian Agricultural Practices, consider the following pairs:**

   Irrigation Technique                        Description
1. Basin Irrigation                             :   Water is applied to the top end of each furrow and flows down the field under the influence of gravity.
2. Furrow Irrigation                           :   Water is applied to the top end of the bay, which is usually constructed to facilitate free-flowing conditions at the downstream end.
3. Bay/Border Irrigation                       : The field is divided into a number of bays or strips, each bay is separated by raised earth check banks (borders).
4. Drip Irrigation                             : Involves dripping water onto the soil at very low rates from a system of small diameter plastic pipes.
5. Sprinkler Irrigation                         : Water is distributed through a system of pipes usually by pumping, then sprayed into the air through sprinklers.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only Drip Irrigation and Sprinkler Irrigation are correctly described in their respective pairs.  Basin irrigation involves flooding a level field, not applying water to furrows. Furrow irrigation uses parallel channels, not bays. Bay/border irrigation utilizes strips separated by borders, unlike the description given. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to the Indian Economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                                 Definition
1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)                :   Total money value of all goods and services produced in a country in a year.
2. Gross National Product (GNP)                : The total value of all goods and services produced by a country's residents, regardless of location.
3. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)              :  Investment through capital instruments essentially in a listed company.
4. Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)                : The charge to a merchant by a bank for accepting payments from his customers through the bank's debit cards.
5. Legal Tender Money                           : The money which a creditor is under compulsion to accept in settlement of his claims.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

GDP accurately reflects the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders. GNP includes the value of goods and services produced by a nation's residents, regardless of location.  MDR correctly defines the charge levied on merchants for accepting card payments. Legal tender money is correctly defined as the currency a creditor must accept for debt settlement.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  While FDI can involve listed companies, the provided definition is too narrow and doesn't capture the broader aspects of FDI.


**4. With reference to the Indian Financial System, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Institution                            Objective/Function
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana                  : To supply credit to small business units.
2. RuPay                                         : A card payment scheme launched by NPCI.
3. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)                   : To encourage young entrepreneurs to set up business particularly in rural areas.
4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme                    : To provide loans to poor farmers for cultivating particular crops.
5. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme/Gold Monetization Scheme: To reduce India’s dependence on gold imports.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

MUDRA Yojana aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system. RuPay is indeed a card payment scheme of NPCI. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme aim to utilize idle gold and reduce import dependence. The Kisan Credit Card scheme provides short-term credit to farmers for various agricultural needs. Small Finance Banks primarily target small businesses and marginal farmers. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the objectives or functions of one or more schemes/institutions.


**5. With reference to the Indian Banking Sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                          Description
1. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)                 : The amount that banks have to maintain in the form of their own funds to offset any loss that banks incur.
2. Commercial Paper                             : A short-term unsecured promissory note.
3. Certificate of Deposit                         : A long-term instrument issued by the RBI to a corporation.
4. Call Money                                    : A short-term finance used for interbank transactions.
5. Zero Coupon Bonds                            : Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks to corporations.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

CAR accurately describes the capital banks must hold against potential losses. Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured debt instrument. Call money is indeed used for short-term interbank lending.  The descriptions of Certificates of Deposit and Zero Coupon Bonds are incorrect.  Certificates of Deposit are not issued by the RBI and Zero Coupon Bonds are not interest-bearing. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**6. With reference to factors influencing the Indian Rupee, consider the following pairs:**

   Factor                                        Effect on Rupee Value
1. Foreign currency earnings of India's IT sector:  Contributes to reducing the risk of a currency crisis.
2. Increasing government expenditure            :  Can increase demand-pull inflation and potentially weaken the rupee.
3. Remittances from Indians abroad              : Contributes to reducing the risk of a currency crisis.
4. Curbing imports of non-essential goods       : Helps stop the slide of the Indian rupee.
5. Following an expansionary monetary policy    :  Likely to weaken the rupee.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency earnings from the IT sector and remittances bolster foreign exchange reserves, reducing currency crisis risk.  Curbing non-essential imports improves the trade balance, supporting the rupee. Increasing government expenditure can be inflationary, potentially weakening the rupee, while expansionary monetary policy can also lead to a weaker currency.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched effects on the rupee value in at least one pair.


**7. With reference to the Indian Agricultural Market, consider the following pairs:**

   Marketing Channel                           Characteristic
1. Apni Mandi                                  :  A regulated market yard in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan.
2. Hadaspar Mandi                              : A farmers' market in Pune, promoting direct sales to consumers.
3. Rythu Bazars                                 : Vegetable and fruit markets in Andhra Pradesh, promoting direct sales to consumers.
4. Uzhavar Sandies                             : Farmers' markets in Tamil Nadu, promoting direct sales to consumers.
5. Regulated Market Yards                      : Farmers sell their produce to intermediaries, not directly to consumers.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Hadaspar Mandi, Rythu Bazars, and Uzhavar Sandies are alternative marketing channels designed to facilitate direct sales from farmers to consumers.  Apni Mandi is not a regulated market yard, and regulated market yards typically involve intermediaries, not direct farmer-consumer sales. Option (b) mischaracterizes Apni Mandi and regulated market yards. Options (c) and (d) include incorrect pairings.


**8. With reference to Indian  Agriculture, consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                           Season
1. Paddy                                          : Kharif
2. Wheat                                          : Rabi
3. Maize                                          : Kharif
4. Groundnut                                     : Kharif
5. Masoor (Lentil)                               : Rabi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Paddy, maize, and groundnut are typically Kharif crops (sown in the monsoon season). Wheat and masoor (lentil) are Rabi crops (sown in the winter season).  All pairs are correctly matched according to common agricultural practices in India.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**9. With reference to  Indian Agricultural Finance, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Support                                   Purpose
1. Minimum Support Price (MSP) for MFP           : To enhance income levels of MFP gatherers.
2. Kisan Credit Card Scheme                       : Construction of family houses and setting up village cold storage facilities.
3. PM-KISAN                                        : To remove subsidies and ask farmers to produce as per market demand.
4. Subsidies on fertilizers, seeds, etc.           : Input-side support for farmers.
5. Logistics subsidies                             : Output-side support for farmers.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

MSP for Minor Forest Produce (MFP) aims to provide fair prices to gatherers.  Kisan Credit Cards provide short-term credit, not funding for house construction or cold storage. PM-KISAN is an income support scheme, not a policy to remove all subsidies and rely solely on market demand. Subsidies on inputs and logistics subsidies are accurate descriptions of their respective functions. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.  The provided text doesn't state PM-KISAN aims to remove *all* subsidies; it suggests a shift away from the current system.



**10. With reference to  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                          Description
1. Appointment of the RBI Governor              : Appointed by the Central Government.
2. Power of the RBI Governor                     : Draws power from the RBI Act.
3. Government's right to issue directions to RBI: The Central Government has the right to issue directions to the RBI in public interest.
4. Supervision of Urban Cooperative Banks        : Supervised and regulated by local boards set up by the State Governments.
5. RBI's management of Government Securities   :Manages and services both Government of India and State Government Securities.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The RBI Governor's appointment by the Central Government, the Governor's power derived from the RBI Act, and the Central Government's right to issue directions are all correctly stated. However, the supervision of Urban Cooperative Banks is not solely by State-level boards; the RBI also plays a role.  The RBI manages both central and state government securities. Options (b), (c), and (d) therefore include at least one incorrect pairing.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Issue                     Major Contributing Factor
1. Air Pollution in Urban Areas           :   Industrial emissions
2. Water Contamination                    :   Deforestation
3. Land Degradation                       :   Unsustainable fuelwood extraction
4. Biodiversity Loss                       :   Overgrazing

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because unsustainable fuelwood extraction and overgrazing are significant contributors to land degradation and biodiversity loss, respectively.  While industrial emissions contribute to air pollution, it's not the *major* contributing factor in all urban areas; vehicular emissions often play a more significant role. Deforestation contributes to various environmental problems, including soil erosion and changes in water cycles, but water contamination stems more from industrial discharge, agricultural runoff (pesticides and fertilizers), and sewage.  The other options incorrectly link factors to environmental problems.  Option (a) is incorrect as industrial emissions are not the sole cause of urban air pollution. Option (b) incorrectly links fuelwood extraction to land degradation only; it also impacts biodiversity. Option (c) is incorrect as deforestation's primary impact is on land degradation and biodiversity; it indirectly affects water quality. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to identify the most accurate cause-and-effect relationships among environmental problems and their contributing factors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Natural Resource                 Location of Abundance in India
1. Iron Ore                           :   Deccan Plateau
2. Coal                               :   Indo-Gangetic Plains
3. Bauxite                             :   Western Ghats
4. Natural Gas                         :   Eastern Coast

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct.  Significant bauxite deposits are found in the Eastern Ghats and Odisha, and natural gas reserves are concentrated along the eastern coast and in the Krishna-Godavari basin.  The other options misrepresent the geographical distribution of resources.  Iron ore is abundant in various parts of India, including Odisha and Jharkhand, not primarily the Deccan Plateau, although the Deccan Plateau has some deposits. Coal is found extensively in the eastern and central parts of India, not solely in the Indo-Gangetic Plains. The question tests factual recall and requires precise knowledge of the geographical distribution of key natural resources in India.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible but incorrect, demanding a high degree of accuracy.


**3. With reference to India’s environmental challenges, consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Problem                  Governmental Initiative to Address It
1. Land Degradation                     :   Chipko Movement
2. Water Contamination                   :   Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
3. Air Pollution (Vehicular)             :   Promoting Biocomposting
4. Solid Waste Management               :   Promoting Biopest Control

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The CPCB is a key government body responsible for monitoring and regulating water and air pollution. While the Chipko Movement is a significant example of people's participation in environmental conservation, it's a grassroots movement, not a direct governmental initiative.  Biocomposting and biopest control are strategies to mitigate environmental problems, but they are not primary governmental initiatives to specifically address air pollution or solid waste.  The question tests conceptual understanding and requires knowledge of both governmental and non-governmental efforts to address environmental challenges in India.  The distractors leverage the familiarity of environmental movements with governmental actions, thereby testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between the two.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Irrigation in India             Region of Predominant Use
1. Canals                               :   Peninsular Plateau
2. Wells                                 :   Indo-Gangetic Plain
3. Tubewells                             :   Andhra Pradesh
4. Tanks                                :   North-Western Rajasthan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Wells are a widely distributed source of irrigation, particularly prevalent in the Indo-Gangetic Plain due to the availability of groundwater.  The other options present incorrect pairings. Canals are more prominent in the northern plains, not the Peninsular Plateau.  While tubewells are used in various regions, their predominance isn't specifically in Andhra Pradesh.  Tanks are primarily found in the southern states, including Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, not North-Western Rajasthan. This question tests factual recall of geographical information related to agricultural practices in India.  The distractors use plausible but incorrect regional connections to test the candidate's precise knowledge.


**5. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Factor Affecting Rice Prices           Type of Impact
1. Minimum Support Price (MSP)           :   Reduces price volatility
2. Government Stockpiling                :   Increases consumer prices
3. Consumer Subsidies                    :   Decreases farmer income
4. Government Trading                    :   Increases market stability

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. MSP aims to provide price support to farmers, reducing price volatility. Government trading can help stabilize markets by managing supply and demand. Consumer subsidies, while beneficial to consumers, can indirectly reduce farmer income if the price paid to the farmer is not adjusted accordingly. Government stockpiling can lead to increased consumer prices if the stocks are released into the market at a higher price or if it leads to artificial scarcity. The incorrect options incorrectly link factors to their impacts, testing the candidate's understanding of the complex interplay of factors affecting agricultural commodity prices.  The distractors are designed to test the nuanced understanding of market dynamics and government interventions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sector in India's Economy             Approximate Share of Workforce in 1999-2000
1. Primary Sector                         :   24%
2. Secondary Sector                       :   16%
3. Tertiary Sector                         :   60%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer. In 1999-2000, the secondary sector (manufacturing, construction, etc.) employed approximately 16% of India's workforce.  The other options contain incorrect data. The primary sector (agriculture, mining) employed a much higher percentage (around 60%), and the tertiary sector (services) also employed a significant portion (around 24%).  The question tests factual recall of key economic statistics and requires accurate knowledge of the distribution of India's workforce across different sectors.  The distractors are designed to be plausible but incorrect figures, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the data.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sustainable Agricultural Practice      Primary Benefit
1. Biocomposting                         :   Reduces water contamination
2. Biopest Control                       :   Increases crop yield
3. Mixed Cropping                         :   Enhances soil fertility
4. Neem-based pesticides                  :   Reduces reliance on chemical fertilizers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Biocomposting helps reduce the need for chemical fertilizers, indirectly reducing water contamination from fertilizer runoff. Biopest control and mixed cropping directly contribute to increased crop yield and enhanced soil fertility.  While neem-based pesticides reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides, their primary benefit isn't necessarily reducing fertilizer use. The question assesses conceptual understanding of sustainable agricultural practices and their environmental and economic benefits. The distractors are carefully crafted to include plausible but less direct or comprehensive benefits, testing the candidate's in-depth knowledge of the subject.

1.  Monocropping                       : Growing two or more crops simultaneously without a definite pattern
2.  Intercropping                       : Growing two or more crops simultaneously in alternate rows
3.  Mixed Cropping                      : Growing only one crop on farmland year after year
4.  Sequential Cropping                 : Growing two or more crops in quick succession on the same land

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Monocropping involves growing a single crop, not multiple crops as described in option 1. Intercropping is accurately defined as growing multiple crops in alternate rows. Mixed cropping is the simultaneous cultivation of multiple crops without a specific pattern, contradicting option 3. Sequential cropping involves planting crops in succession on the same land, aligning with option 4.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Livestock Product/Activity         Significance
1.  Milk Production                    :  India is the second largest producer globally

3.  Poultry Production                 : Accounts for the largest share of livestock distribution in India
4.  Draft Power from Bullocks         :  Significantly declined due to agricultural mechanization

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India is the largest, not the second largest, producer of milk globally. The Pink Revolution indeed modernized meat and poultry processing. Poultry farming does constitute the largest share of India's livestock distribution. The use of bullocks for draft power has decreased considerably with the mechanization of agriculture. Hence, pairs 2, 3 and 4 are correctly matched, while pair 1 is incorrect due to the inaccurate ranking of India's milk production.


**6.  With reference to factors affecting agricultural markets in India, consider the following pairs:**

2. Government Stockpiling                 :  Can influence rice prices
3. Government Trading                     :  Can influence rice prices
4. Consumer Subsidies                     : Directly affects the price paid by consumers for rice

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

MSP doesn't always guarantee profitable prices for farmers; it's a price floor, and market forces can still impact actual prices received. Government stockpiling and trading actions directly influence market supply and demand, thus impacting prices. Consumer subsidies reduce the price consumers pay, affecting the market equilibrium. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because MSP doesn't guarantee profitability in all scenarios.

**Explanation:**

The Agriculture Export Policy 2018 explicitly aimed to diversify India's agricultural export basket, destinations, and boost high-value exports.  The goal of doubling farmers' income by 2022 involved multiple strategies, including diversification into high-value crops and shifting labor from agriculture to higher-productivity non-farm sectors. The NDDB, instrumental in the White Revolution, significantly increased milk production through its cooperative model. The Green Revolution's core strategy was the introduction and widespread adoption of HYV seeds, leading to a substantial increase in food grain production.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs. Option (d) accurately reflects the key recommendations associated with each policy or initiative.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of key agricultural policies and their impact.


**2. With reference to Indian Agriculture, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                         Definition/Description
1. Cropping Intensity                           :   Ratio of Gross Cropped Area to Net Sown Area
2. Jhum Cultivation                              :   Practiced primarily in North-Eastern Indian States
3. Operational Holding                          :   Agricultural land operated by one person regardless of ownership
4. Mixed Farming System                         :   Combination of crop and livestock farming

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Cropping intensity is accurately defined as the ratio of gross cropped area to net sown area, reflecting the efficiency of land use. Jhum cultivation, also known as slash-and-burn agriculture, is predominantly practiced in the northeastern states of India. An operational holding refers to the land managed by a single individual, irrespective of ownership, reflecting the operational unit in agricultural statistics. Mixed farming involves integrating crop production with livestock rearing, poultry, or other agricultural activities. All four pairs are correctly matched, showcasing the candidate's knowledge of fundamental agricultural terminology and practices. The options are designed to test the recall of precise definitions and understanding of common agricultural terms.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  Source of Agricultural Growth                  Description/Characteristic
1. Improvement in livestock productivity       :   Mixed farming system enhances resource efficiency
2. Increase in cropping intensity               :   Less than 50% of cultivable land is under irrigation
3. Diversification towards high-value crops   :   Staple crops occupy 77% of gross cropped area
4. Improvement in terms of trade for farmers :   Inflation in economy affects farmers' real income

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The improvement in livestock productivity is directly linked to the efficient resource utilization within mixed farming systems. The increase in cropping intensity is hampered by the limited irrigation coverage in India.  Diversification towards high-value crops is a strategy to increase farmers' income, but the statement about staple crops' dominance in gross cropped area is accurate. The improvement in terms of trade for farmers is directly impacted by the inflation rate in the economy. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the partially inaccurate statement about high-value crop area. Option (c) correctly identifies the relationship between the source of growth and its description. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the factors influencing agricultural growth and their interconnectedness.


**4. With reference to the challenges faced by the Indian manufacturing sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Challenge                                       Specific Issue
1. Land Acquisition                               :   High population density limiting land availability
2. Transportation Infrastructure                   :   High freight costs and congestion in railways
3. Port Efficiency                                :   Inefficient port management leading to delays
4. Power Supply                                  :   Lack of 24X7 power supply across the country
5. Labour Laws                                   :   Complex labour laws hindering ease of employment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's high population density significantly restricts land availability for industrial purposes.  The high cost and congestion within the railway system impede efficient transportation of goods. Inefficient port management leads to delays in the import and export of raw materials and finished products. The lack of consistent and affordable power supply across the country is a major constraint for manufacturing.  Complex labour laws make it difficult for businesses to hire and fire employees, increasing operational costs. All five pairs accurately reflect challenges faced by the Indian manufacturing sector. The options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the structural impediments to manufacturing growth in India.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Five-Year Plan Objective                       Specific Action/Focus
1. First Five Year Plan                         :   Emphasis on agriculture and rural development
2. Second Five Year Plan                        :   Prioritization of heavy industries
3. Third Five Year Plan                          :   Focus on import substitution industrialization
4. Fourth Five Year Plan                         :   Emphasis on poverty alleviation and employment generation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The First Five Year Plan prioritized agriculture and rural development to address food security concerns. The Second Five Year Plan focused on building heavy industries to create a strong industrial base. The Third Five Year Plan emphasized import substitution industrialization to reduce dependence on foreign goods. The Fourth Five Year Plan aimed to tackle poverty and unemployment by promoting various development programs.  All four pairs accurately reflect the primary objectives of the respective Five-Year Plans. The options are structured to test the candidate's understanding of India's planned economic development and its historical context.  The candidate needs to accurately recall the primary focus of each plan.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Indian economic development, particularly aspects of budgeting, subsidies, and agricultural policy.  Note that some aspects of the target content, like specific numerical data from tables, are difficult to incorporate into MCQs that meet all criteria without becoming overly simplistic or requiring extensive, impractical explanations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                    Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana     :   Social Protection and Social Inclusion
2. MGNREGA                               :   100% Central Funding
3. Namami Gange                           :   Implemented by a Central Agency
4. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana     :   Optional Scheme for States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is primarily focused on rural infrastructure development, but its impact contributes significantly to social inclusion and protection by improving connectivity and access to essential services.  MGNREGA is a centrally sponsored scheme, but it doesn't receive 100% central funding; it involves cost sharing with state governments. Namami Gange is a centrally implemented scheme focused on the Ganga river's rejuvenation.  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is a crop insurance scheme, but it's not an optional scheme; States are encouraged to participate but participation is not optional in the sense it’s not a matter of choice. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Indian Union Budget, consider the following pairs:**

   Budget Component                         Source of Funds
1. Consolidated Fund of India                :   Parliamentary Authorization
2. Contingency Fund of India                 :   President of India's Discretion
3. Public Account                             :   Parliamentary Authorization
4. Deposits and Advances Fund                :  Revenue from Taxes and Other Receipts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Consolidated Fund of India receives all government revenues and requires parliamentary authorization for withdrawals. The Contingency Fund of India is used for unforeseen emergencies and is at the President's discretion until Parliament approves it. The Public Account holds money received by the government but not belonging to the Consolidated Fund; it does not require direct parliamentary authorization for every transaction. Deposits and Advances Fund is a bookkeeping category and not a source of funding for the budget. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Subsidy                             Example
1. Direct Producer Benefit Subsidy             :  Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers
2. Indirect Consumer Benefit Subsidy          :  Public Distribution System (PDS)
3. Explicit Economic Subsidy                  :  Fertilizer Subsidy
4. Implicit Social Subsidy                     :  Government funding for Health services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

MSP directly benefits producers by guaranteeing a minimum price for their produce. PDS indirectly benefits consumers by providing subsidized food grains. Fertilizer subsidies are a clear, explicit economic subsidy. Government funding for health services is an implicit social subsidy, as it's not directly tied to a specific product but aims to improve overall social well-being.  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to agricultural subsidies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Subsidy Scheme                                  Implementation Method
1.  PM-AASHA                                     :   Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)
2.  PM-KISAN                                      :   Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS)
3.  Fertilizer Subsidy                             :   Price Subsidy
4.  LPG Subsidy                                   :   Price Support Scheme (PSS)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PM-AASHA is an umbrella scheme encompassing various methods, not solely DBT. PM-KISAN is an income support scheme, not a PDPS. Fertilizer subsidies are primarily price subsidies.  LPG subsidy is primarily a price subsidy delivered through DBT, but it's not directly related to the PSS. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The question highlights the complexity of subsidy schemes and their multiple implementation mechanisms.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Extension Agency                  Function
1. Department of Agriculture & Cooperation (DAC) :  Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)
2. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) :  Agri-clinics and Agri-business Centres
3. National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology (NMAET) :  Seed chain management
4.  NABARD                                        :   Institute Village Linkage Programme (IVLP)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

DAC is involved in various extension activities, but KVKs are primarily under ICAR.  ICAR is involved in technology dissemination, but Agri-clinics and Agri-business Centres are promoted by DAC and NABARD. NMAET has a sub-mission specifically focused on seed and planting material. NABARD's role is primarily financial, while IVLP is associated with ICAR.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of various institutions and their roles in agricultural extension.


These questions demonstrate the application of factual knowledge, analytical skills in matching pairs, and the ability to identify subtle distinctions and potential distractors, all key skills necessary for success in the UPSC exam.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer, a detailed explanation, and analysis of distractors.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

     Economic Indicator                    Impact on Economic Development (if not met)
    1.  Increase in absolute real GNP       :   Higher poverty and unemployment
    2.  Increase in per capita real GNP     :   Stagnation of industrial output
    3.  High savings economy                :   Unchanged poverty levels
    4.  Faster import growth than export growth :   Decreased worker productivity in rural areas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) correctly identifies that increases in real GNP (both absolute and per capita) do not automatically translate to higher economic development if accompanied by rising poverty and unemployment (pair 1) or if industrial output lags (pair 2).  These pairs highlight the limitations of using simple growth indicators without considering distributional effects and sectoral balance.  A high savings rate doesn't guarantee output increase due to factors like a high capital-output ratio (as mentioned in the source), rendering option (b) and (d) incorrect.  While faster import growth than export growth *can* negatively impact economic development, it's not a direct consequence of the other metrics and is therefore not a universally reliable match (pair 4). Option (c) is incorrect because pair 3 is not a correct match.

**2. With reference to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                  Fact
    1. PPP exchange rates                     :   Calculated by comparing prices of goods and services across countries
    2. India's economic ranking (PPP dollars):   Sixth largest economy globally
    3. CPI vs. WPI weightings                :   CPI gives more weight to services than WPI

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing identical baskets of goods and services across different nations (pair 1). India's position as the sixth largest economy when measured in PPP dollars is a well-established fact (pair 2). Finally, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) typically allocates a higher weight to services compared to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) because it reflects consumer spending more comprehensively (pair 3). Therefore, all three pairs are accurate, making (d) the correct option.

**3. With reference to market demand and influencing factors, consider the following pairs:**

    Factor                                    Effect on Market Demand
    1.  Increase in price of a substitute good:   Increase in demand for the original good
    2.  Increase in price of a complement good:   Decrease in demand for the original good
    3.  Income increase (inferior good)        :   Decrease in demand for the original good
    4. Price fall of the original good         :   Increase in demand for the original good

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the standard relationships in economics. An increase in the price of a substitute good leads to higher demand for the original good (pair 1).  Conversely, an increase in the price of a complementary good reduces the demand for the original good (pair 2). Finally, a price decrease for a good always increases its demand (pair 4). However, an increase in income for an inferior good will *decrease* its demand, not increase it (pair 3). Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy and exchange rates, consider the following pairs:**

     Exchange Rate Indicator                    Effect
    1. Increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER):  Rupee appreciation
    2. Increase in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) :   Improved trade competitiveness
    3. Increasing domestic inflation relative to other countries :   Increased divergence between NEER and REER

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately describe the relationships between exchange rate indicators and their economic implications in the Indian context.  A rise in NEER indicates the rupee is appreciating against a basket of currencies (pair 1).  An increase in REER, which considers inflation differentials, does suggest improved trade competitiveness (pair 2). Finally, a widening gap between domestic and global inflation tends to drive a growing disparity between NEER and REER (pair 3).  Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correct matches.


**5. With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following pairs:**

     Financial Instrument                      Characteristic
    1. Commercial Paper                       :   Short-term, unsecured promissory note
    2. Certificate of Deposit                    :   Long-term instrument issued by scheduled commercial banks
    3. Call money                               :   Short-term interbank transaction financing
    4. Zero-coupon bonds                       :   Short-term, interest-bearing bonds issued by scheduled commercial banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is indeed a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by corporations (pair 1). Call money is a short-term funding mechanism used primarily in interbank transactions (pair 3). However, certificates of deposit are typically short-term instruments issued by banks, not long-term (pair 2). Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; the return comes from the difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity (pair 4). Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**6. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following pairs:**

     Influencing Factor                         Effect
    1.  Actions of the United States Federal Reserve:   Direct impact on Indian bond yields
    2.  Actions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)     :   Direct impact on Indian bond yields
    3.  Inflation and short-term interest rates        :   Indirect impact on Indian bond yields

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs show accurate relationships.  The US Federal Reserve's actions (e.g., interest rate changes) have a significant global impact, indirectly influencing Indian bond yields (pair 1). The RBI's monetary policy directly affects Indian bond yields through its open market operations and interest rate decisions (pair 2). Inflation and short-term interest rates are crucial determinants of long-term bond yields (pair 3).  Thus, all three pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer.  The interconnectedness of global and domestic financial markets makes all three factors relevant.


**7. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

     Aspect of RBI                                   Characteristic
    1.  Appointment of the Governor                  :   Appointed by the Central Government
    2.  Power of the Governor                        :   Derived from the RBI Act
    3.  Government directives to RBI                    :   Issued by the Central Government in public interest

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are accurate representations of how the RBI functions within the Indian institutional framework. The Central Government appoints the RBI Governor (pair 1). The Governor's authority stems from the RBI Act, which defines the central bank's powers and responsibilities (pair 2).  Finally, the Constitution allows the Central Government to direct the RBI in matters of national interest (pair 3). Therefore, all three are correctly matched, making (d) the correct option.


**8. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following pairs:**

     Type of Investment                                  Characteristic
    1.  Foreign currency convertible bonds               :   Direct investment in Indian companies
    2.  Foreign institutional investment with conditions:   Direct investment in Indian companies
    3.  Global depository receipts                         :   Direct investment in Indian companies
    4.  Non-resident external deposits                   :   Not considered FDI

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched.  Non-resident external deposits are not considered FDI because they represent short-term investments, primarily in debt instruments, lacking the direct ownership and control associated with FDI.  Foreign currency convertible bonds, foreign institutional investment (with certain conditions), and Global Depository Receipts can all, under specific circumstances, be considered as indirect investments but are not classified as Foreign Direct Investment.  Therefore, option (c) correctly identifies the only accurate pairing.



**9. With reference to the effects of currency devaluation, consider the following pairs:**

     Effect                                           Outcome
    1.  Improved competitiveness of exports       :   Increased export demand
    2.  Increased foreign value of domestic currency:   Decrease in export demand
    3.  Improved trade balance                      :   Favorable shift in balance of trade


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Devaluation makes exports cheaper and more competitive in international markets, potentially increasing export demand (pair 1). A positive trade balance, where exports exceed imports, can result from increased exports due to devaluation. (pair 3). However, devaluation *reduces* the foreign value of the domestic currency, not increases it (pair 2).  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are accurately matched, making (b) the correct option.


**10. With reference to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

    Factor                                      Contributes to Demand-Pull Inflation
    1. Expansionary monetary policies            :   Yes
    2. Fiscal stimulus                             :   Yes
    3. Inflation-indexing wages                     :   Yes
    4. Higher purchasing power                     :   Yes
    5. Rising interest rates                         :   No

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Expansionary monetary policies, fiscal stimulus, inflation-indexing wages, and higher purchasing power all contribute to increased aggregate demand, thereby fueling demand-pull inflation.  Rising interest rates, however, tend to curb inflation by reducing borrowing and investment. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, making (a) the correct answer.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Subsidy Scheme                       Type of Subsidy
1. PM-KISAN                              :  Price Subsidy
2. LPG Subsidy (pre-DBT)                :  Income Support
3. Fertilizer Subsidy                     :  Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)
4. National Food Security Act Subsidy    :  Price Subsidy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

PM-KISAN (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi) provides direct income support to eligible farmers, not a price subsidy on specific goods.  LPG subsidies, before the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system, were price subsidies, reducing the cost of LPG cylinders for consumers.  Fertilizer subsidies are typically implemented through price controls, making the fertilizers cheaper than the market price,  thus acting as a price subsidy. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) involves price subsidies through the Public Distribution System (PDS), offering food grains at reduced rates to eligible beneficiaries. Therefore, only pair 4 accurately reflects the type of subsidy associated with the scheme.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly categorize at least one scheme.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic of Public Goods        Example
1. Non-rivalrous                           :  National Defence
2. Non-excludable                        :  Clean Air
3. Rivalrous                               :  Police Services
4. Excludable                             :  Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Public goods are characterized by non-rivalry (one person's consumption doesn't diminish another's) and non-excludability (it's difficult to prevent anyone from consuming the good). National defence fits this description; one person's protection doesn't reduce another's. Similarly, clean air is non-excludable, as everyone breathes it. Police services, while having elements of public good, are often targeted and thus partially excludable. Education, while having public good aspects, is often excludable through tuition fees or access restrictions.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 correctly match the characteristics with examples. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include at least one mismatched pair, demonstrating a lack of understanding of public good characteristics.


**3. With reference to subsidies, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Subsidy                         Mechanism
1. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)           :  Cash transfer to Aadhaar-linked accounts
2. Price Subsidy                           :  Government procurement at MSP
3. Income Support                         :  Provision of subsidized goods and services
4. Implicit Subsidy                         :  Budgetary allocation for public services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

DBT directly transfers cash to beneficiaries, while price subsidies lower the price of goods or services.  Government procurement at Minimum Support Prices (MSP) is a form of price support.  Implicit subsidies are often embedded in government budgets for public services, not direct cash transfers or price adjustments on specific goods. Income support provides direct financial aid without specifying how it's spent, unlike price subsidies or DBT which are tied to specific goods or services. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) misses the correct matching of implicit subsidies, Option (c) excludes the accurate matching of price subsidies, and option (d) incorrectly includes income support as being linked to the provision of subsidized goods and services.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                     Characteristic
1. Consumer Price Index (CPI)             :  Includes services
2. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)           :  Higher weight for food
3. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :  Reflects real trade competitiveness
4. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)   :  Indicates rupee appreciation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 only

**Explanation:**

CPI, unlike WPI, incorporates services in its calculation. WPI gives higher weightage to manufactured goods than food. NEER reflects the value of the rupee against a basket of currencies but doesn't factor in inflation, hence doesn't directly indicate real trade competitiveness. REER adjusts NEER for inflation, providing a more accurate picture of real trade competitiveness.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) all contain at least one incorrectly matched pair, showcasing a misunderstanding of these economic indicators.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                      Primary Aim
1. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) :  Income Support for Farmers
2. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) : Crop Insurance
3. National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) : Wage Employment Generation
4.  Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) :  Dairy and meat processing infrastructure development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

PMFBY is a crop insurance scheme, while PM-KISAN provides direct income support.  NREGA aims at providing guaranteed wage employment in rural areas. AHIDF focuses on building infrastructure for animal husbandry, particularly dairy and meat processing. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 correctly match the scheme with its primary aim. Options (a), (c), and (d) all include at least one incorrect pairing, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of government schemes and their objectives.


**6.  With reference to methods of poverty alleviation, consider the following pairs:**

    Approach                                      Method
1. Growth-oriented approach                   :   Targeted poverty alleviation programs
2. Asset creation and work generation approach :   Public expenditure on social consumption needs
3. Minimum basic amenities approach             :   Trickle-down effect of economic growth

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The growth-oriented approach relies on the trickle-down effect of overall economic growth to reduce poverty, not targeted programs. Asset creation and work generation approaches focus on creating jobs and increasing assets for the poor through specific programs. The minimum basic amenities approach emphasizes providing essential services like food, education, and healthcare to improve living standards, not through the trickle-down effect.  Therefore, only pair 2 correctly matches the approach with its method. Options (a), (c), and (d) demonstrate a lack of understanding of the different approaches to poverty alleviation.


**7. With reference to  measuring poverty in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Committee/Expert Group                 Poverty Line Methodology
1. Tendulkar Committee                     :  Based solely on calorie intake
2. Rangarajan Committee                    :  Revised the poverty line upwards from Tendulkar's estimates
3. Lakdawala Committee                     :  Used a multidimensional poverty index

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Tendulkar committee's methodology included both calorie intake and non-food expenditure. The Rangarajan committee revised the poverty line upwards from the Tendulkar committee's estimates.  The Lakdawala committee primarily used consumption expenditure data to calculate poverty lines and did not use a multidimensional poverty index.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) demonstrate a misunderstanding of the methodologies used by these different committees in estimating poverty lines in India.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                     Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                       :  Long-term unsecured promissory note
2. Certificate of Deposit                   :  Issued by RBI to corporations
3. Call Money                               :  Used for interbank transactions
4. Zero-coupon Bond                        :  Interest-bearing, short-term bond issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note. Certificates of deposit are issued by banks, not the RBI. Call money is indeed used for short-term interbank transactions. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest but are sold at a discount and mature at face value.  Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The other options reflect common misconceptions regarding these financial instruments.





**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                     Associated Scholar/Committee
1. Poverty Line based on nutritional requirement exclusively : Alagh Committee
2. Idea of ‘Cultural Poverty’                     : Gunnar Myrdal
3. Annual publication of ‘World Development Report’ : United Nations Development Programme
4.  Committee recommending poverty line based on nutritional requirement : Lakdawala Committee
5.  Categories of poverty identified by UNDP        : Income poverty


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Tendulkar Committee, not the Alagh Committee, is associated with recommending a poverty line based on nutritional requirements exclusively.  Gunnar Myrdal is correctly linked to the concept of 'Cultural Poverty.' The World Development Report is indeed an annual publication of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), not the UNDP. The UNDP has identified both income poverty and human poverty as categories of poverty.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly include pairs based on inaccurate attributions of committees and organizations to specific concepts. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's depth of knowledge and ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in commonly held beliefs regarding poverty and development indicators.


**2. With reference to human capital formation, consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Human Capital                   Description
1. Investment in Education                   : Increases future profits
2. Investment in Health                       : Increases labour productivity
3. On-the-job training                       : Improves access to healthcare
4. Migration                               : Involves transport and living costs
5. Information Acquisition                   : Relates to labour market salaries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Investment in education is a primary source of human capital, aiming to increase future income and earning potential, aligning with the description.  Investment in health enhances the productivity of the workforce by reducing absenteeism and improving overall health. On-the-job training directly boosts labour productivity through skill enhancement. Migration, while seeking better opportunities and higher salaries, entails costs associated with relocation and adjustment.  Information acquisition, related to market conditions, helps in making informed decisions about human capital investments.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are accurately matched. Option (a) incorrectly includes pair 3, which conflates health investment with healthcare access. Option (b) omits accurate pairs, and option (c) includes an incorrect pairing. The inclusion of seemingly plausible but ultimately incorrect pairings necessitates careful consideration of each element to arrive at the correct answer, making this a challenging question.



**3. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                         Characteristic
1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)   : Appreciation of the Rupee
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)       : Improvement in trade competitiveness
3. Increasing trend in domestic inflation relative to inflation in other countries : Increasing divergence between NEER and REER


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

An increase in NEER signifies a strengthening of the Rupee against a basket of currencies, indicating appreciation. An increase in REER, however, does *not* always indicate improved trade competitiveness.  REER takes into account inflation differentials; a rise can mean a loss in competitiveness if domestic inflation outpaces that of trading partners.  An increasing gap between domestic and foreign inflation rates creates a widening divergence between NEER (which reflects nominal exchange rates) and REER (which considers inflation). Thus, pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrect because an increase in REER doesn’t automatically translate to better trade competitiveness. The inclusion of this misleading pair increases the difficulty and demands a clear understanding of the intricacies of exchange rate dynamics.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Subsidy Type                                 Characteristic
1. Price Subsidies                              : Often regressive
2. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)                : Reduces leakages
3. Income Support                              : Distorts markets


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Price subsidies frequently benefit wealthier households disproportionately more than poorer ones because the wealthy consume more of the subsidized goods.  DBT mechanisms, by directly transferring funds to beneficiaries, minimize leakages and inefficiencies inherent in traditional distribution systems. Income support, unlike price subsidies or DBT, does not directly influence market prices or resource allocation, hence it does not distort markets. Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Pair 3 is incorrect; income support is designed to avoid market distortions.  The inclusion of this seemingly plausible but incorrect pairing makes the question challenging, necessitating a thorough understanding of subsidy mechanisms.


**5. With reference to macroeconomic indicators, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                   Calculation Method
1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)               : Income Method
2. Gross National Product (GNP)               : Expenditure Method
3. Net National Product (NNP)                 : GNP minus Depreciation
4. Personal Disposable Income (PDI)           : PI minus taxes and non-tax payments
5. GDP Deflator                               : Ratio of Nominal GDP to Real GDP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

GDP can be calculated using the income method (sum of factor incomes), the expenditure method (sum of final expenditures), and the product method (sum of value added). GNP is calculated by adjusting GDP for net factor income from abroad. NNP is derived by subtracting depreciation from GNP. PDI is obtained by deducting personal and non-tax payments from personal income. The GDP deflator is indeed calculated as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrect because GNP is not exclusively calculated through the expenditure method. The inclusion of this distractor raises the complexity of the question, making it more challenging for candidates who lack a thorough grasp of macroeconomic accounting.


**6. With reference to poverty alleviation programs in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Program                                    Primary Objective
1. National Food for Work Programme (NFWP) : Wage employment generation
2. Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY) : Self-employment opportunities
3. Swaranjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY): Self-help group support


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NFWP's primary aim is to provide wage employment, particularly focusing on unskilled manual labor, primarily for poverty alleviation.  SGRY, while encompassing elements of wage employment, also aimed at creating self-employment opportunities. The SGSY is specifically designed to promote self-help groups (SHGs) as a means to improve the financial and economic well-being of the poor.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 2 is incorrect because SGRY's focus was broader than solely self-employment. The inclusion of this misleading pair increases the challenge, demanding precise knowledge of Indian poverty alleviation policies.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                            Description
1. Seigniorage                                : Profit from money creation
2. Consumer Price Index (CPI)                 : Index of wholesale prices
3. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)                 : Index of prices of a consumer basket
4.  Budget Deficit                              : Government expenditure exceeding tax revenue
5. Trade Deficit                               : Excess of import expenditure over export revenue


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Seigniorage accurately refers to the profit a central bank earns from money creation.  The budget deficit correctly describes the scenario where government spending surpasses its tax revenue. A trade deficit correctly represents the situation where a nation's imports exceed its exports.  However, the descriptions for CPI and WPI are reversed. CPI measures retail prices for consumer goods, while WPI tracks wholesale prices.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The inclusion of the reversed CPI and WPI definitions increases the question's difficulty and requires candidates to possess precise knowledge of economic terminology.


**8. With reference to rural development in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Concept                           Associated Feature
1. Bharat Nirman                               : Infrastructure development
2. Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)             : Joint ventures for infrastructure projects
3. Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)               : Public-private partnerships for infrastructure
4. Private Public Partnership (PPP)           : A type of government funding
5. Special Economic Zones (SEZs)              : Primarily focused on industrial development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Bharat Nirman is a comprehensive rural infrastructure development initiative. SPVs are commonly used in infrastructure projects to combine public and private resources. BOT is a model of public-private partnership for infrastructure projects. PPP is a collaboration between public and private sectors for infrastructure projects. SEZs, while impacting rural areas indirectly, are primarily focused on industrial development and export promotion.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 5 is incorrect because SEZs are not a form of government funding for rural development. The question's difficulty comes from the inclusion of seemingly related but ultimately incorrect pairings, requiring a nuanced understanding of rural development initiatives.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Variable                           Definition/Characteristic
1. Personal Income (PI)                       : National Income minus undistributed profits and corporate taxes
2. National Disposable Income                 : Net National Product at market prices plus current transfers from the rest of the world
3. Real GDP                                    : GDP calculated at constant prices
4. GDP Deflator                               :  Index of prices of goods and services produced domestically
5. Consumer Price Index (CPI)                 : A measure of inflation based on a basket of consumer goods


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Personal income is correctly defined as national income less undistributed profits and corporate taxes plus transfer payments. National Disposable Income correctly incorporates net national product and international transfers. Real GDP is accurately described as GDP adjusted for price changes. CPI accurately reflects inflation based on a representative consumer basket. The GDP deflator, while a price index, is specifically for domestically produced goods and services, not all goods and services as implied in the pair. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Pair 4 is incorrect due to an imprecise definition of the GDP deflator. The inclusion of a nearly correct but subtly inaccurate definition enhances the question's difficulty level.


**10. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Development Challenge                     Associated Factor
1.  Persistence of Poverty                     : Unequal distribution of income and assets
2.  Widening gap between rich and poor       :  High rate of inflation in luxury goods
3.  Growth in absolute and per capita real GNP : Increase in poverty and unemployment
4.  High saving economy but low output increase: Weak administrative machinery
5. High saving economy but low output increase: High capital-output ratio


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Unequal distribution of resources contributes directly to persistent poverty. The widening gap between the rich and poor is linked to factors like unequal distribution of income and assets, and not necessarily the inflation rate in luxury goods alone.  While growth in GNP does not guarantee welfare improvement, an increase in poverty and unemployment directly negates the positive effects of such growth.  A high saving economy can experience low output growth if there are issues like weak administrative machinery or low productivity (reflected in a high capital-output ratio).  Therefore, pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Pairs 2 and 3 present oversimplified and potentially misleading correlations.  The inclusion of these distractors makes the question more challenging, demanding a nuanced understanding of the Indian economy's complexities.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to economic development and poverty alleviation in India.  The questions are designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Program                                 Key Feature/Objective
1.  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) 2005 :   Providing minimum basic amenities to the people
2.  Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY)   :  Generating wage employment for the unskilled poor in urban areas
3.  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)        :  Creating self-employment opportunities in rural areas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) 2005, now Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), aims to guarantee 100 days of wage employment to rural households.  It's a direct employment generation program, not primarily focused on providing basic amenities. While improved living standards might be a consequence, it's not the core objective. Option 1 is thus incorrect.

Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY) was designed to create employment opportunities, both self-employment and wage employment, specifically in urban areas. This directly addresses the statement in the pair.  Option 2 is correct.

Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) focuses on connecting unconnected habitations in rural areas through all-weather roads.  While this improves connectivity and might indirectly support economic activities, its primary aim isn't creating self-employment opportunities.  Option 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.

**2. With reference to poverty alleviation programs in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Program                                     Primary Focus
1.  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) :   Wage employment generation
2.  National Food for Work Programme (NFWP)      :   Improving food and nutritional status
3.  Public Distribution System (PDS)             :   Providing minimum basic amenities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program focuses on improving the nutritional and health status of children below six years of age, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. It encompasses supplementary nutrition, immunization, health check-ups, and preschool education.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The National Food for Work Programme (NFWP) aimed to provide food security and employment to the poorest sections of society through wage employment in exchange for work on infrastructure projects.  Its primary focus is indeed improving food and nutritional status through work-based food provision. Pair 2 is correct.

The Public Distribution System (PDS) is a government-sponsored system to provide food grains at subsidized rates to the poor. This is a key initiative aimed at providing minimum basic amenities. Pair 3 is correct. Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to India's economic development, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Policy                     Description/Characteristic
1.  Inclusive Growth                  :   Focuses solely on rapid GDP growth
2.  Amrit Kaal                         :   A 25-year period leading up to India's centenary of independence
3.  Priority Sector Lending (PSL)     :   Excludes startups from receiving credit support from banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Inclusive growth aims to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared equitably across all sections of society, not just focusing on GDP growth.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

Amrit Kaal refers to the 25-year period from India's 75th year of independence to its 100th year, signifying a period of focused national development. Pair 2 is correct.

Priority Sector Lending (PSL) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) includes startups as a category eligible for preferential credit access from banks. Pair 3 is incorrect. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Reform Initiative            Associated Goal
1.  Disinvestment of Public Sector Units (PSUs) : To increase government revenue and improve PSU efficiency
2.  Removal of quantitative restrictions on imports   :  To boost domestic industries and protect them from foreign competition
3.  Liberalization of trade                 : To promote greater participation of the private sector in the economy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Disinvestment of PSUs aims to generate revenue for the government and, ideally, to improve the efficiency of the remaining PSUs through market competition. Pair 1 is correctly matched.

Removing quantitative restrictions on imports is intended to increase competition and lower prices for consumers, not to protect domestic industries. This is a core tenet of liberalization. Pair 2 is incorrectly matched.

Liberalization, in general, promotes private sector participation and competition. Pair 3 is correctly matched.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Human Capital           Explanation
1.  Investment in Health               :  Reduces labour productivity and increases absenteeism
2.  On-the-job training               :  Increases labour productivity and enhances skills
3.  Migration                         : Always leads to a decrease in human capital in the origin region

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Investment in health improves the quality of the labour force, reducing absenteeism and boosting productivity.  Pair 1 is incorrectly matched.

On-the-job training directly improves skills and productivity. Pair 2 is correctly matched.

Migration can lead to both gains and losses in human capital for both origin and destination regions. Skilled workers migrating can deplete human capital in the origin region, but it can also lead to knowledge transfer and remittances.  Pair 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to poverty, subsidies, and economic development.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.  Note that the questions are framed without explicitly mentioning the source material.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Primary Focus
1.  MGNREGA                                  :  Rural Employment Guarantee
2.  PMRY                                     :  Urban Self-Employment
3.  SJSRY                                    :  Rural Self-Employment
4.  SGSY                                     :  Rural Self-Help Groups


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is a flagship program aimed at providing guaranteed wage employment in rural areas.  The Prime Minister's Rozgar Yojana (PMRY) focuses on creating self-employment opportunities primarily in urban areas.  The Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY) is designed for urban employment generation, offering both self-employment and wage employment avenues.  The Swaranjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) is a rural program supporting self-help groups (SHGs) for self-employment activities.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly associate schemes with inappropriate primary focuses.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Subsidy Type                            Example
1.  Price Subsidy                           :  Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers
2.  Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)           :  LPG subsidy
3.  Income Support                         :  PM-KISAN scheme
4.  Producer Subsidy                        : Fertilizer Subsidy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairings are correct.  Price subsidies involve providing goods or services below market prices (MSP is a prime example). DBT directly transfers subsidy amounts to beneficiaries' accounts (as in the LPG subsidy scheme). Income support provides direct cash transfers to individuals or groups (PM-KISAN for farmers). Producer subsidies are given to producers to reduce their costs of production (Fertilizer Subsidy).  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to poverty alleviation programmes in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Programme                                   Key Feature
1.  National Food for Work Programme (NFWP) :  Guaranteed wage employment
2.  Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY) :  Self-employment opportunities
3.  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) :  100 days of guaranteed wage employment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NFWP and NREGA (now MGNREGA) both focus on providing wage employment, with NREGA guaranteeing a minimum of 100 days of work. SGRY aimed at providing both wage and self-employment opportunities. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                       Measurement
1.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)            :  Total market value of goods and services
2.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)               :  Wholesale price levels
3.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)           :  Basket of goods and services comparison across countries
4.  Wholesale Price Index (WPI)             :  Retail price levels


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders.  CPI tracks changes in the prices of goods and services consumed by households. PPP compares the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries to determine relative exchange rates. WPI measures changes in the prices of goods at the wholesale level.  Therefore, only 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                                  Description
1.  Trade Deficit                               :  Exports exceed imports
2.  Trade Surplus                               :  Imports exceed exports
3.  Capital Account Surplus                      :  Net capital inflow
4.  Current Account Deficit                      :  Imports exceed exports


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A trade deficit occurs when imports exceed exports. A trade surplus happens when exports exceed imports.  A capital account surplus signifies a net inflow of capital. A current account deficit indicates that a country's imports of goods and services, plus net income and transfers, exceed its exports.  Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly define economic terms.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fiscal Policy Measure                       Effect
1.  Increase in Government Spending          :  Increased Aggregate Demand
2.  Tax Cuts                                  :  Reduced Aggregate Demand
3.  Increase in Interest Rates                 :  Reduced Investment
4.  Decrease in Money Supply                  :  Increased Inflation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Increased government spending directly boosts aggregate demand. Tax cuts increase disposable income, leading to increased consumption and investment and thus, increased aggregate demand. Increased interest rates make borrowing more expensive, discouraging investment. A decrease in the money supply tends to reduce inflation, not increase it (other factors remaining constant). Thus, only 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.



**7. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                          Characteristic
1.  Seigniorage                               :  Profit from money creation
2.  Inflation Tax                              :  Loss of purchasing power due to inflation
3.  Regressive Subsidy                         :  Benefits disproportionately favour the wealthy
4.  Fiscal Deficit                             :  Government spending exceeds revenue


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Seigniorage is the profit a government or central bank makes from issuing currency. An inflation tax is the implicit tax on money holdings due to inflation eroding their purchasing power. A regressive subsidy benefits wealthier individuals more than poorer ones. A fiscal deficit occurs when government spending surpasses its revenue.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

  Institution                                 Function
1.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)              :  Regulates commercial banks
2.  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) :  Regulates stock markets
3.  Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) :  Regulates insurance companies
4.  Competition Commission of India (CCI)     :   Regulates competition in markets


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RBI is the central bank and plays a vital role in regulating commercial banks in India. SEBI regulates the securities market and protects investors' interests. IRDAI regulates and develops the insurance sector. CCI ensures fair competition in various markets.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.



**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Unemployment                     Example
1.  Structural Unemployment                 :  Technological advancements in manufacturing
2.  Cyclical Unemployment                   :  Economic recession
3.  Frictional Unemployment                 :  Job search after graduation
4.  Seasonal Unemployment                  :  Agricultural labour during non-harvest season


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Structural unemployment arises from mismatches between skills and available jobs, often due to technological change. Cyclical unemployment is associated with the business cycle's fluctuations. Frictional unemployment occurs during the transition between jobs. Seasonal unemployment is tied to specific seasons or periods (agriculture is a classic example).  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Development Strategy                        Characteristic
1.  Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) :  Protection of domestic industries
2.  Export-Oriented Industrialization (EOI)   :  Emphasis on exports
3.  Trickle-Down Economics                    :  Focus on economic growth benefiting all
4.  Inclusive Growth                           :   Focus on equitable distribution of benefits


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

ISI involves protecting domestic industries from foreign competition. EOI prioritizes producing goods for export markets. Trickle-down economics assumes economic growth will automatically lift everyone. Inclusive growth aims for equitable distribution of benefits.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                     Primary Focus
1. Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana          :   Financial Inclusion
2. Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana    :   Health Insurance
3. Mudra Bank Yojana                        :   Rural Employment
4. Saubhagya Yojana                         :   Education for Girls

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is a financial inclusion initiative aimed at bringing the unbanked population into the formal banking system.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) provides a personal accident insurance cover, not health insurance.  Mudra Bank Yojana focuses on providing loans to micro and small entrepreneurs, primarily for employment generation, not specifically rural employment.  Saubhagya Yojana aims at providing electricity connections to all households, not education for girls.  The other options are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. Option (b) incorrectly includes PMSBY, option (c) incorrectly includes Saubhagya Yojana, and option (d) incorrectly includes Mudra Bank Yojana. Only option (a) correctly identifies the primary focus of PMJDY.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                         Target Beneficiary Group
1. Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana        :   Organized Sector Workers
2. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi      :   All Eligible Farmer Families
3. MGNREGA                                   :   Rural Poor
4. Saakshar Bharat Programme              :   Male Literacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY)  initially targeted the unorganized sector, not the organized sector.  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) provides income support to all eligible farmer families. MGNREGA is a flagship rural employment guarantee scheme aimed at providing employment to the rural poor. Saakshar Bharat Programme focuses on adult literacy, with a particular emphasis on female literacy, not male literacy.  Option (a) is correct as it correctly identifies the beneficiary groups for PM-KISAN and MGNREGA. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of government schemes and their target beneficiaries.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Programme                                 Primary Goal
1. Right to Education Act, 2009                 :   Higher Secondary Education
2. Akshay Patra Foundation                     :   Nutrition for Rural Old People
3. Nalanda Project                               :   Ministry of Minority Affairs
4. Saakshar Bharat Programme                   :   Female Literacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Right to Education Act, 2009, aims at providing free and compulsory education up to the elementary level, not higher secondary education. Akshay Patra Foundation is associated with providing mid-day meals to primary school students, not nutrition for rural old people. The Nalanda Project is a programme of the Ministry of External Affairs, not the Ministry of Minority Affairs. Saakshar Bharat Programme focuses on adult literacy, with a particular emphasis on female literacy.  Option (a) is correct because it correctly identifies the primary goal of the Saakshar Bharat Programme. The other options include at least one incorrectly matched pair, demonstrating the importance of detailed knowledge of government initiatives and their objectives.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Programme                      Characteristic
1. MGNREGA                                   :   Reduction in Bargaining Power of Labourer
2. Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana    :   Premium payable is Rs. 12 per annum
3. National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) :   Employment Generation
4. National Social Security Fund (NSSF)     :   Poverty Alleviation Programme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

MGNREGA, while aiming to increase rural purchasing power and reduce migration, has been criticized for not significantly impacting the bargaining power of labourers. Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) does have a premium of Rs. 12 per annum. The National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) focuses on poverty reduction through women's empowerment and employment generation. The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) is not primarily a poverty alleviation programme; it's a social security scheme. Only pair 3 accurately reflects the core characteristic of NRLM. The other options incorrectly link characteristics to programmes, highlighting the importance of understanding the nuances of government initiatives.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                         Description
1. Commercial Paper                           :   Long-term instrument issued by RBI
2. Certificate of Deposit                       :   Short-term unsecured promissory note
3. Call Money                                   :   Interbank transactions
4. Zero Coupon Bonds                           :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note, not a long-term instrument issued by the RBI. Certificates of Deposit are short-term borrowings issued by banks and corporations, not long-term instruments issued by the RBI. Call money is indeed used for short-term interbank transactions. Zero-coupon bonds are not interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks; they are bonds sold at a discount and mature at face value. Only pair 3 correctly describes the nature of call money.  The other options contain inaccurate descriptions of financial instruments, emphasizing the need for precise understanding of financial terminology.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Function                                  Description
1. Banker's Bank                               :   Advises commercial banks on monetary matters
2. Managing Government Securities            :   Services State Government Securities only
3. Issuing Treasury Bills                       :   Issued at par value


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The RBI acts as a banker's bank, lending funds to commercial banks, holding their deposits, and providing monetary advice.  The RBI manages and services both Central and State Government Securities. Treasury bills are issued at a discount, not at par value. Therefore, only pair 1 accurately describes an RBI function. The other options incorrectly link functions with descriptions, emphasizing the need to understand the various roles played by the RBI within the Indian financial system.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                                    Definition
1. Merchant Discount Rate                         :   Incentive to merchants for accepting digital payments
2. Legal Tender Money                             :   Money tendered in courts of law
3. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)                   :   Decided by each individual bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a charge levied on merchants by banks for accepting card payments, not an incentive. Legal tender money is money that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in payment of debts. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a regulatory requirement set by the central bank, not decided by individual banks.  Only pair 1 correctly defines the MDR, albeit with a slight nuance in its meaning. Other options present inaccurate definitions, highlighting the need for a precise understanding of economic concepts.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Factor Affecting Currency Crisis Risk          Impact
1. Foreign Currency Earnings of IT Sector       :   Increases risk
2. Increasing Government Expenditure           :   Reduces risk
3. Remittances from Indians Abroad             :   Reduces risk


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency earnings from the IT sector contribute to foreign exchange reserves, thus reducing the risk of a currency crisis. Increasing government expenditure can worsen a country's fiscal position, increasing the risk of a currency crisis. Remittances from Indians abroad bolster foreign exchange reserves, mitigating currency crisis risks. Pair 2 is incorrect because increased government spending can inflate the economy, increasing the risk of a currency crisis.  Pair 3 is correct as remittances reduce currency crisis risk. Only option (c) reflects these accurate impacts.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Action/Policy to Stop Rupee Slide            Effect
1. Curbing Imports                             :   Reduces pressure on the Rupee
2. Issuing Rupee-Denominated Masala Bonds   :   Increases demand for Rupee
3. Following an Expansionary Monetary Policy :   Increases demand for Rupee

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Curbing imports reduces demand for foreign currency, supporting the rupee. Issuing rupee-denominated Masala bonds attracts foreign investment in rupees, increasing demand for the rupee. An expansionary monetary policy can weaken the currency. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect; an expansionary monetary policy would typically decrease the value of the rupee. Only options 1 and 2 accurately reflect the effect of the stated actions.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Factor Affecting Money Multiplier           Effect
1. Increase in Cash Reserve Ratio               :   Increases money multiplier
2. Increase in Banking Habit                    :   Increases money multiplier
3. Increase in Statutory Liquidity Ratio        :   Increases money multiplier


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

An increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) reduces the money multiplier as banks have less money to lend. An increase in the banking habit increases the money multiplier as more deposits are available for lending. An increase in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) also reduces the money multiplier as banks are required to hold more liquid assets.  Only pair 2 accurately reflects the impact on the money multiplier.  The other options are incorrect because they include pairs where the relationship between the factor and the effect on the money multiplier is inverse or incorrect.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

   Action/Policy for Immunity to Global Crisis     Effectiveness
1. Not Depending on Short-Term Borrowings     :   Increases immunity
2. Opening Up to More Foreign Banks             :   Increases immunity
3. Maintaining Full Capital Account Convertibility:   Increases immunity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Reliance on short-term foreign borrowings increases vulnerability during global crises. Opening up to more foreign banks can increase the exposure to global financial shocks. Full capital account convertibility can make a country more susceptible to speculative attacks during a crisis.  Only avoiding short-term borrowings enhances immunity.  The other options include actions that can either be neutral or even increase vulnerability during a global financial crisis.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

   Effect of Cash Withdrawal from Demand Deposit   Impact
1. Immediate Effect on Aggregate Money Supply  :   Reduces it by the withdrawal amount
2. Impact on Money Multiplier                   :   Reduces it
3. Impact on overall liquidity in the economy     :   Reduces it

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Withdrawing cash directly reduces the money supply by the amount withdrawn. The money multiplier is affected but not immediately and not in a simple, directly proportional way. Overall liquidity is reduced, but the immediate effect is primarily on the money supply. Only pair 1 reflects the immediate and direct effect. Other pairs describe more complex and indirect consequences that are not necessarily immediate.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

   Kisan Credit Card Scheme Purpose              Correctness
1. Working Capital for Farm Asset Maintenance:   Correct
2. Purchase of Combine Harvesters               :   Correct
3. Consumption Requirements of Farm Households:   Correct
4. Post-Harvest Expenses                        :   Correct
5. Construction of Family House                  :   Incorrect

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme primarily provides short-term credit for agricultural activities, including working capital, purchase of machinery, and post-harvest expenses.  It does not typically cover consumption requirements or non-agricultural investments like house construction.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) accurately identifies these. Other options incorrectly include the inaccurate pair related to house construction.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement about Indian Economy                    Correctness
1. Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured note: Correct
2. Certificate of Deposit is issued by RBI to a corporation: Incorrect
3. Call money is used for interbank transactions:     Correct
4. Zero coupon bonds are issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks: Incorrect

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is indeed a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by corporations. Certificates of deposit are issued by banks, not the RBI. Call money is used for short-term interbank lending and borrowing. Zero-coupon bonds can be issued by various entities, not exclusively by Scheduled Commercial Banks. Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (a) correctly reflects this. Other options include incorrectly matched pairs, showcasing the need for accurate knowledge of financial instruments.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

    Characteristic of FDI in India                 Correctness
1. Investment through capital instruments in listed companies: Incorrect
2. Largely non-debt creating capital flow:            Correct
3. Investment involving debt servicing:               Incorrect
4. Investment made by foreign institutional investors in government securities: Incorrect

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

FDI can be in listed or unlisted companies. FDI is primarily equity investment, not debt.  Debt servicing is associated with external commercial borrowings. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) engage in portfolio investment, not FDI.  Therefore, only pair 2 correctly describes a major characteristic of FDI in India.  Other options include incorrect statements about FDI, emphasizing the need for a clear understanding of FDI's nature.


**16. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement about RBI Governor                     Correctness
1. Appointed by the Central Government:          Correct
2. RBI Act is the source of power:                 Correct
3. Central Government can issue directions:       Correct

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Central Government appoints the RBI Governor.  The RBI Governor's powers are derived from the RBI Act. The Constitution empowers the Central Government to issue directions to the RBI in the public interest.  All three statements accurately describe aspects of the RBI Governor's appointment, powers, and relationship with the Central Government.


**17. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement about Urban Cooperative Banks          Correctness
1. Supervised by local boards set up by State Governments: Incorrect
2. Can issue equity and preference shares:           Correct
3. Brought under Banking Regulation Act, 1949:    Correct

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Urban Cooperative Banks are regulated by the RBI, not local boards.  They can indeed issue equity and preference shares.  An amendment in 1966 did bring them under the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) accurately identifies this. Other options incorrectly include the statement about local supervision.


**18. Consider the following pairs:**

   Influence on Indian Government Bond Yields      Correctness
1. Actions of the US Federal Reserve:             Correct
2. Actions of the Reserve Bank of India:           Correct
3. Inflation and short-term interest rates:        Correct

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Global factors, like actions by the US Federal Reserve, influence Indian bond yields. Domestic factors, such as RBI actions and inflation/interest rates, also significantly impact bond yields.  All three factors influence Indian government bond yields.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched.


**19. Consider the following pairs:**

   Included in Foreign Direct Investments           Correctness
1. Foreign currency convertible bonds:             Incorrect
2. Foreign institutional investment with conditions: Incorrect
3. Global depository receipts:                      Correct
4. Non-resident external deposits:                 Incorrect

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency convertible bonds are a form of external commercial borrowing. Foreign institutional investment is portfolio investment, not FDI. Global depository receipts represent FDI. Non-resident external deposits are not considered FDI. Only pair 3 correctly identifies a component of FDI.  Other options include forms of investment that are not classified as FDI.


**20. Consider the following pairs:**

   Effect of Currency Devaluation                   Correctness
1. Improves competitiveness of domestic exports:  Correct
2. Increases foreign value of domestic currency:   Incorrect
3. Improves trade balance:                         Incorrect

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Devaluation makes exports cheaper and more competitive. It does not increase the foreign value of the domestic currency; it decreases it.  The effect on the trade balance is not guaranteed; it depends on various factors, including price elasticity of demand. Only pair 1 accurately describes a necessary effect of devaluation.


**21. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cause of Demand-Pull Inflation in India        Correctness
1. Expansionary policies:                        Correct
2. Fiscal stimulus:                              Correct
3. Inflation-indexing wages:                     Correct
4. Higher purchasing power:                      Correct
5. Rising interest rates:                         Incorrect

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies increase aggregate demand, leading to demand-pull inflation. Fiscal stimulus, by increasing government spending, fuels demand-pull inflation.  Inflation-indexing wages increases disposable income, boosting demand and inflation. Higher purchasing power directly increases demand. Rising interest rates, however, typically curb inflation by reducing investment and consumption.  Only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) accurately reflects this.  Option (c) is incorrect because rising interest rates counter demand-pull inflation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                     Associated Person/Entity
1. Vicious Circle of Poverty             :    Karl Marx
2. Measurement of Unemployment in India:    Usual Principal Status
3. Mid-day Meal Scheme                 :    Universalization of Secondary Education
4. National Pension Scheme (NPS)       :    Regulated by the IRDA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The concept of the "Vicious Circle of Poverty" is primarily associated with Ragnar Nurkse, not Karl Marx.  Nurkse's work emphasized the self-perpetuating nature of poverty, where low income leads to low savings, limited investment, and consequently, continued low income.  While Marx addressed poverty within his broader theories of capitalism, the specific concept of the "vicious circle" is attributed to Nurkse.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) uses several methods to measure unemployment in India, including Usual Principal Status (UPS), Current Monthly Status (CMS), Current Weekly Status (CWS), and Current Daily Status (CDS).  Therefore, UPS is correctly paired.

The Mid-day Meal Scheme, launched in 1995, primarily aims to promote universalization of primary education, not secondary education.  By providing nutritious meals to children, it improves school attendance and reduces malnutrition, thus supporting primary education goals.

The National Pension System (NPS) is regulated by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), not the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA). The IRDA regulates the insurance sector, while PFRDA oversees pension schemes.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Program          Primary Goal
1. MGNREGA                               :   Adult Literacy
2. NRLM (National Rural Livelihoods Mission):  Urbanization of Rural Areas
3. SJSRY (Swarn Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana):  Universalization of Primary Education
4. National Social Security Fund (NSSF) :   Poverty Alleviation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) aims to guarantee wage employment to rural households, not adult literacy.  While education indirectly benefits from the increased income and improved living conditions, the primary goal is employment generation.

The National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) focuses on empowering women through self-help groups and promoting rural livelihoods, not urbanization of rural areas.  While improved livelihoods might lead to some migration, the core objective is poverty reduction and empowerment within rural communities.

The Swarn Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY) was designed to create employment opportunities in urban areas, not to promote primary education. While education might be a beneficial outcome for some beneficiaries, the program's primary focus was urban employment.

The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) is a significant program aimed at poverty alleviation by providing social security benefits to vulnerable sections of society.  It directly addresses poverty by offering financial support and protection.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Poverty Measurement Indicator       Description
1. Per capita income in different States:   Basis for establishing poverty level in India
2. Household average income          :   Not used by NSSO for measuring unemployment
3. Household consumption expenditure:   A proxy for income used to identify the poor
4. Slum population in the country     :   Indicator of vulnerability to risks and socio-political access

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While per capita income is a relevant economic indicator, the poverty level in India is primarily established based on household consumption expenditure, not per capita income across states.  Consumption expenditure reflects actual living standards more directly than per capita income, which can be skewed by income distribution within states.

Household average income, while a general indicator of economic well-being, is not directly used by the NSSO for measuring unemployment.  The NSSO employs methods such as UPS, CMS, CWS, and CDS to measure unemployment.

Household consumption expenditure is a widely used proxy for income, particularly in developing countries like India where accurate income data is often scarce or unreliable.  It provides a more practical measure of a household's ability to meet basic needs.

Slum population is indeed an indicator of vulnerability, but it is not a primary or comprehensive measure of poverty.  It highlights a specific aspect of deprivation related to housing and living conditions, but it doesn't capture the multifaceted nature of poverty.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                             Governing Ministry/Body
1. CAPART                                  :   Ministry of Industry
2. National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) :   Ministry of Rural Development
3. Planning Commission                    :   Ministry of Finance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Council for Advancement of People's Action and Rural Technology (CAPART) is an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Rural Development, not the Ministry of Industry.  CAPART focuses on promoting rural development initiatives through technology and people's participation.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) operates under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  The NSSO is responsible for collecting data on various socio-economic aspects, including poverty and unemployment.

The Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) was not directly under any specific ministry.  It functioned as an independent body advising the government on planning and policy matters, reporting directly to the Prime Minister.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator of Human Development Index (HDI)     Relevance to India's HDI Ranking
1. Availability of safe drinking water            :   Lowers India's HDI rank
2. More credit to farmers                        :   Improves India's HDI rank
3. More children going to school                 :   Improves India's HDI rank
4. More adults getting literate                   :   Improves India's HDI rank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Improved access to safe drinking water is a crucial component of HDI, directly impacting health and well-being.  Lack of access lowers HDI rankings.

Increased credit availability for farmers can lead to improved agricultural productivity, increased income, and better living standards, ultimately improving HDI.

Higher school enrollment rates among children directly contribute to improved education levels, a key component of HDI.

Increased adult literacy rates are directly linked to improved human capital, increased earning potential, and better overall well-being, resulting in a higher HDI rank.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement about Bare Necessities Index (BNI)      Truth Value
1. The Economic Survey created the BNI.            :   True
2. The BNI was created for all States for 2018 only.:   False
3. The BNI is based on 26 indicators.                :   True
4. The BNI consists of six dimensions.                :   True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Economic Survey does indeed present the Bare Necessities Index (BNI) at both rural and urban levels.  The BNI is a composite index designed to measure the access of households to essential goods and services.

The BNI is not limited to data for 2018 only; it encompasses data for various years, providing a longitudinal perspective on access to basic necessities.

The BNI is based on 26 indicators, reflecting a comprehensive assessment of different aspects of basic needs.

The BNI is structured around six dimensions, representing different facets of well-being, such as water, sanitation, housing, and health.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement about PM CARES Fund           Truth Value
1.  Trustees act pro bono.                     :   True
2.  It is regulated by the IRDA.                :   False
3.  It facilitates regular income for all citizens.:   False
4. It is a retirement benefit scheme.           :   False

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PM CARES Fund operates on the principle that its trustees serve pro bono, meaning without compensation. This ensures that the funds are dedicated to their intended purpose.

The PM CARES Fund is not regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA).  It is a separate entity with its own governance structure.

The PM CARES Fund does not aim to facilitate regular income for all citizens.  Its focus is on providing relief during emergencies and national crises.

The PM CARES Fund is not a retirement benefit scheme. It is a distinct fund with a specific mandate related to disaster relief.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Human Capital Formation       Example
1. Investment in education                  :   On-the-job training
2. Investment in health                     :   Preventive medicine
3. Migration                               :   Acquiring information about the labor market
4. Information                              :   Rural-urban migration for better job opportunities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Investment in health encompasses various aspects, including preventive medicine, curative medicine, and social medicine, all aimed at improving the health and productivity of the workforce.

Migration, particularly rural-urban migration, is a significant source of human capital formation as individuals seek better employment opportunities, leading to skill development and increased income.


Investment in education includes formal schooling, vocational training, and higher education, all contributing to skill enhancement and increased earning potential.  On-the-job training falls under this broader category.

Acquiring information about labor markets, educational opportunities, and health services is a crucial aspect of human capital formation as it enables individuals to make informed decisions about investments in their skills and well-being.




**1. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Source of Human Capital                     Example
    1. Investment in Education                  :  On-the-job training programs
    2. Investment in Health                      :  Provision of clean drinking water
    3. On-the-job Training                     :  Expenditure on preventive medicine
    4. Migration                                 :  Firms sending workers for off-campus training

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Investment in education encompasses various aspects, including formal schooling, vocational training, and skill development.  On-the-job training, while contributing to human capital, is a distinct category rather than a direct example of investment in education. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.  Investment in health directly improves the health and productivity of the workforce.  Providing clean drinking water is a crucial component of public health infrastructure and thus correctly matched with Investment in Health (pair 2).  On-the-job training, as described in the source text, involves firms investing in their employees' skills, making pair 3 incorrect. Migration, while indirectly influencing human capital through exposure to new skills and opportunities, is not a direct source of human capital formation in the same manner as education or health. Pair 4 is therefore also incorrect.  Hence, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA), consider the following pairs:**

    Sub-scheme                                     Feature
    1. Price Support Scheme (PSS)                 :   Direct payment of price difference to farmers
    2. Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS)    :   Physical procurement of crops by Central Nodal Agencies
    3. Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS) :  Maximum service charges up to 15% of notified MSP

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Price Support Scheme (PSS) under PM-AASHA involves the physical procurement of pulses, oilseeds, and copra by central nodal agencies.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. The Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) focuses on direct payment of the difference between MSP and the selling price to pre-registered farmers, without physical procurement. Pair 2 is thus incorrect. The Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS) allows private agencies to procure commodities at MSP with a maximum service charge of 15% of the notified MSP. This makes pair 3 correctly matched.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of PM-KISAN                                 Detail
    1. Annual Income Support                           : Rs. 2,000 every four months
    2. Funding Source                                   :  State Governments
    3. Eligibility Criteria                             : Includes Central Government employees

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PM-KISAN scheme provides an annual income support of Rs. 6,000, disbursed in three equal installments of Rs. 2,000 every four months. This makes pair 1 correctly matched.  The scheme is entirely funded by the Central Government, not state governments; thus, pair 2 is incorrect.  The scheme explicitly excludes certain categories of farmers, including central and state government employees and PSU employees. Therefore, pair 3 is also incorrect. Only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology (NMAET), consider the following pairs:**

    Sub-Mission                                        Focus Area
    1. Sub Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE)   :  Farm mechanization
    2. Sub-Mission on Seed and Planting Material (SMSP) : Strengthening PPV&FRA
    3. Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) : Adoption of quality seeds
    4. Sub Mission on Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine (SMPP): Integrated Pest Management

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Sub Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE) focuses on disseminating information and best practices to farmers, not farm mechanization.  Pair 1 is therefore incorrect.  The Sub-Mission on Seed and Planting Material (SMSP) indeed aims to strengthen the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Authority (PPV&FRA). Pair 2 is correctly matched. The Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) focuses on farm mechanization, making pair 3 incorrect. The Sub Mission on Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine (SMPP) promotes Integrated Pest Management, making pair 4 correctly matched.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), consider the following pairs:**

    Function of KVKs                                   Description
    1. Technology Refinement                          :  Providing critical input support to farmers
    2. Knowledge Dissemination                        : Conducting on-farm testing of technologies
    3. Input Support                                  : Conducting demonstrations at farmers' fields
    4. Multidisciplinary Approach                      :  Technology assessment

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

KVKs are involved in technology assessment and refinement, making pair 1 correctly matched. They also actively disseminate knowledge and provide critical input support to farmers, making pair 4 correctly matched.  However, conducting on-farm testing and demonstrations at farmers' fields are key aspects of their knowledge dissemination and technology demonstration activities, not solely input support.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are incorrectly matched. Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to  the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF), consider the following pairs:**

    Beneficiary Category                              Funding Arrangement
    1. FPOs                                            :  100% loan from scheduled banks
    2. MSMEs                                           :  90% loan from scheduled banks, 10% margin money
    3. Not for Profit Companies                       :   3% interest subvention (4% for aspirational districts)
    4. Private Companies                             :  2-year moratorium period for principal loan amount

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The AHIDF provides funding to various categories.  FPOs, MSMEs, Not-for-profit companies, and private companies are all eligible.  However, the funding arrangement involves a 90% loan component from scheduled banks and a 10% margin money contribution from the beneficiary. This is true for MSMEs and other categories.  The interest subvention and moratorium period are also features of the scheme. Therefore, multiple pairs are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), consider the following pairs:**

    Risk Covered                                       Feature
    1. Prevented Sowing/Planting Risk              :  Post-harvest losses due to cyclones
    2. Standing Crop Risk                             :  Yield losses due to non-preventable risks
    3. Post-Harvest Losses                           :  Coverage only up to two weeks post-harvest
    4. Localized Calamities                          :   Losses arising out of war and nuclear risks

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2 and 3 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2 and 3 only
    (d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PMFBY covers various risks. Prevented sowing/planting is covered under specific conditions, but post-harvest losses due to cyclones are a separate risk covered under the scheme.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Standing crop risk explicitly includes yield losses due to various non-preventable risks, making pair 2 correct. Post-harvest losses have a limited coverage period of two weeks, making pair 3 correct. Losses due to war and nuclear risks are specifically excluded, making pair 4 incorrect. Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8.  With reference to different ways of disbursing subsidies in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Subsidy                                  Characteristic
    1. Price Subsidy                                  :  Reduces leakages and diversion
    2. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)                  :  Often regressive
    3. Income Support                                 : Does not distort the market
    4. Universal Basic Income (UBI)                   : Paid in kind or vouchers

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Price subsidies are prone to leakages and are often regressive, meaning richer households benefit more. Pair 1 is incorrect. DBT aims to reduce leakages and improve efficiency; pair 2 is incorrect. Income support, by providing cash directly, avoids market distortions. Pair 3 is correct. UBI is a cash transfer, not paid in kind or vouchers, so pair 4 is incorrect. Only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**9. With reference to fuel subsidies in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Fuel Type                                          Subsidy Status
    1. Petrol                                            :  Subsidized through DBT
    2. Diesel                                             : Sold at market price
    3. LPG                                              :  Completely eliminated
    4. Kerosene                                         : Subsidized through PDS

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 2 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Petrol and diesel prices were deregulated, and there are no subsidies. LPG subsidies are provided through DBT, and kerosene subsidies have been phased out. Only pair 2 correctly reflects that diesel is sold at market prices without subsidies.


**10. With reference to government expenditure, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Expenditure                                    Example
    1. Capital Expenditure                               : Debt Financing
    2. Revenue Expenditure                               : Acquiring new technology
    3. Capital Expenditure                               : Equity Financing
    4. Revenue Expenditure                               :  Payment of salaries

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2 and 4 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Acquiring new technology is a capital expenditure as it increases the organization's productive capacity. Payment of salaries is a revenue expenditure. Debt financing is considered capital expenditure, as it is used to finance long-term investments. Equity financing is also considered capital expenditure, as it involves issuing shares to raise capital for long-term investments.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to economic development and poverty alleviation.  The questions are designed to be challenging, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring in-depth knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Initiative                           Focus Area
1.  MGNREGA                               :   Urban Employment Generation
2.  Ayushman Bharat                         :   Rural Infrastructure Development
3.  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana    :   Rural Healthcare
4.  Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana :   Rural Employment Guarantee

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) focuses on providing guaranteed wage employment in rural areas, not urban. Ayushman Bharat (PM-JAY) is a national health insurance scheme, primarily aimed at improving healthcare access, not rural infrastructure. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is specifically designed for rural road connectivity.  Only Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY) aims at urban employment generation.  The other options incorrectly link schemes with areas outside their intended scope, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of government initiatives.  Option (d) accurately identifies the sole correct pairing.


**2. With reference to Inclusive Growth in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Challenge                                 Key Characteristic
1.  Poverty                                  :   High proportion of population below poverty line as per Rangarajan Committee report
2.  Employment                              :   Predominance of informal sector employment with low wages and social security
3.  Agriculture                             :   High contribution to GDP despite a large portion of the population being employed in it
4.  Regional Disparities                    :   Uniform per capita income across states

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Rangarajan Committee report indeed highlighted a significant portion of India's population living below the poverty line, making statement 1 correct.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the employment situation in India, with the majority working in the informal sector. However, statement 3 is incorrect; agriculture contributes a relatively small percentage to India's GDP despite employing a large portion of the population. Statement 4 is false because of significant regional disparities in per capita income across Indian states. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The inclusion of incorrect pairs tests the candidate's ability to critically evaluate information.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Poverty Alleviation Programme          Primary Objective
1.  Food for Work Programme              :   Providing subsidized food grains
2.  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) :   Generating rural wage employment
3.  Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS)     :   Improving adult literacy rates
4.  Public Distribution System (PDS)       :   Boosting agricultural productivity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Food for Work Programme's primary aim was to generate employment and provide food security through wage employment, making statement 1 partially correct.  NREGA's main objective is indeed generating guaranteed wage employment in rural areas, making statement 2 correct. The ICDS focuses on improving the nutritional and health status of children and pregnant women, not adult literacy. The PDS aims to provide subsidized food grains to the poor, not boosting agricultural productivity.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's ability to discern the core objectives of different poverty alleviation schemes.


**4. With reference to Human Capital Formation in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution                                      Function
1.  NCERT                                       :   Regulating Higher Education
2.  UGC                                          :   Conducting Medical Research
3.  AICTE                                        :   Regulating Technical Education
4.  ICMR                                         :   Developing Educational Curricula

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) is primarily responsible for developing educational curricula and textbooks, not regulating higher education. The University Grants Commission (UGC) regulates higher education, not medical research. The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) indeed regulates technical education. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) conducts biomedical research, not develops educational curricula. Only statement 3 correctly matches the institution with its primary function.  The other options contain incorrect or misleading pairings, testing the candidate's knowledge of key Indian educational and research institutions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                         Description
1.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)          :   Compares prices of a basket of goods across countries using a single currency
2.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)              :   Measures changes in prices at the wholesale level
3.  Wholesale Price Index (WPI)            :  Measures changes in prices of services
4.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :  Reflects changes in a currency's value considering inflation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

PPP accurately compares the relative cost of goods and services between countries, usually expressed in a common currency like the US dollar. CPI measures price changes at the consumer level, not wholesale. WPI measures changes in wholesale prices, not services. NEER reflects the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies, it does not inherently factor in inflation.  The other options include incorrect or partially correct statements about these economic indicators, testing the candidate's understanding of their specific applications and limitations.  Only option (a) correctly identifies the single accurate pairing.


**6.  Consider the following pairs:**

     Economic Indicator                       Impact of Economic Recession
1.  Inflation Rate                           :   Always increases during a recession
2.  Unemployment Rate                       :   Always decreases during a recession
3.  Demand for Money                         :   Decreases during a recession
4.  Output/GDP                               :   Increases during a recession

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

During an economic recession, inflation typically decreases because reduced demand leads to lower prices, making statement 1 incorrect. Unemployment rates generally rise, not fall during a recession, making statement 2 incorrect.  The demand for money usually decreases during recessions as economic activity slows and less money is needed for transactions, making statement 3 correct. Output and GDP contract, not expand, during a recession, making statement 4 incorrect. Option (b) accurately points to the only correct pairing, testing the candidate’s understanding of macroeconomic indicators' behavior during economic downturns.



**7. With reference to the Indian Economy, consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                      Definition
1.  Deficit Financing                         :   Borrowing from the public to finance a budget deficit
2.  Venture Capital                           :   Short-term capital for established industries
3.  Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)           :   Minimum percentage of deposits banks must hold in liquid assets
4.  Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) :  A fixed interest rate on bank loans

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Deficit financing involves the government borrowing to cover budget shortfalls, making statement 1 correct. Venture capital provides long-term funding to startups and new businesses, not short-term funding for established companies, making statement 2 incorrect. SLR mandates the minimum amount of liquid assets banks must maintain, making statement 3 correct. MCLR is a benchmark interest rate that banks use to set lending rates, it’s not a fixed rate, making statement 4 incorrect.  The other options present a combination of correct and incorrect pairings, demanding a precise understanding of financial and economic terms.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                    Description
1.  Phillips Curve                             :   Shows a direct relationship between inflation and unemployment in the long run
2.  Seigniorage                               :   Profit from money creation for governments
3.  Balance of Payments                       :   Records only import and export of goods
4.  Current Account                           :   Includes foreign assets and liabilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Phillips Curve demonstrates an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment in the short run, not a direct one in the long run, making statement 1 incorrect. Seigniorage is indeed the profit governments earn from creating money, making statement 2 correct. Balance of Payments is a broader record encompassing both visible and invisible transactions, not just goods, making statement 3 incorrect.  The current account focuses on trade in goods and services, income receipts and payments, and current transfers, not assets and liabilities, making statement 4 incorrect. Only statement 2 is entirely accurate, requiring a nuanced understanding of macroeconomic concepts.  The distractors test the candidate's ability to differentiate between related but distinct economic principles.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Indian Polity and Governance, drawing upon themes related to subsidies, poverty alleviation, and economic development.  Note that the questions are designed to be challenging and may require in-depth knowledge of Indian economic policy and history.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Subsidy                         Example
1. Price Subsidy                           :  Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers
2. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)           :  LPG subsidy transfer to bank accounts
3. Income Support                          :  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)
4. Indirect Subsidy                         :  Fertilizer subsidy through below-market pricing

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a classic example of a price subsidy where the government sets a minimum price for agricultural produce, ensuring farmers receive a guaranteed price irrespective of market fluctuations.  The direct transfer of LPG subsidies directly into bank accounts via DBT is a well-known example of a DBT scheme. PM-KISAN provides direct income support to eligible farmer families, representing income support.  Fertilizer subsidies, often implemented by selling fertilizers at below-market prices, are a form of indirect subsidy.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to poverty alleviation programs in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Program                                  Primary Objective
1. National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) :  Guaranteed wage employment for rural households
2. Public Distribution System (PDS)          :  Provision of subsidized food grains to the poor
3. Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) :  Improve nutrition and healthcare for children
4. Swarna Jayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY)     :  Promote self-employment opportunities in rural areas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NREGA aims to guarantee a minimum number of days of wage employment to rural households, addressing unemployment and poverty. The PDS provides subsidized food grains to the poor, enhancing their food security. ICDS focuses on improving the nutritional status and healthcare of children from vulnerable groups. SGSY promotes self-employment through financial assistance and skill development programs. Option (a) and (b) incorrectly exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs while option (d) is entirely incorrect.  The question tests factual recall of key government programs and their objectives.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                       Main Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) :  Provides comprehensive crop insurance coverage against various risks
2. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) :  Provides direct income support to small and marginal farmers
3.  Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) :  Incentivizes investments in dairy and meat processing infrastructure
4.  PM-AASHA                               :  Aims at ensuring remunerative prices to farmers for their produce through multiple mechanisms

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the core features of the respective schemes. PMFBY provides insurance against crop losses due to various perils. PM-KISAN offers direct income support to farmers. AHIDF focuses on developing infrastructure for animal husbandry. PM-AASHA employs multiple mechanisms to ensure that farmers receive fair prices.  The other options incorrectly omit correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of these crucial agricultural initiatives.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                          Description
1. Fiscal Stimulus                              :  Government's intensive action to boost economic activity
2. Value Added Tax (VAT)                     :  Multi-point destination-based tax on value addition
3. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)            :  More stable than Foreign Institutional Investment (FII)
4. Consolidated Fund of India                 :  Receives all tax revenues of the Union Government

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A fiscal stimulus involves government intervention to stimulate economic activity. VAT is a multi-point tax levied on the value added at each stage of production and distribution. The Consolidated Fund of India receives all tax revenues.  However, FDI is not inherently more stable than FII; stability depends on various factors. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched, highlighting the need for precise understanding of economic concepts.  The inclusion of a false statement (3) acts as a strong distractor.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Economic Indicator                       Characteristic
1.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)           : Measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders
2.  Gross National Product (GNP)           : Includes income earned by residents abroad, but excludes income earned by non-residents within the country
3.  Human Development Index (HDI)         : Composite index including life expectancy, education, and per capita income
4.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)              : Measures changes in the price level of a basket of consumer goods and services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country's geographical boundaries. GNP considers the income earned by residents both domestically and abroad. HDI is a composite measure of human development. CPI tracks changes in consumer prices.  The other options fail to recognize the accurate definitions and characteristics of these essential economic indicators.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of core economic concepts and their definitions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                     Recommendation
1. Lakdawala Committee                         :   Poverty computation based on Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) using Mixed Reference Period
2. Tendulkar Committee                         :  Poverty computation based on Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) using Mixed Reference Period
3. Dandekar Committee                          :  Poverty computation based on Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) using Mixed Reference Period
4. Alagh Committee                             :  Poverty computation based on Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) using Mixed Reference Period

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Tendulkar Committee's methodology for poverty estimation in India is widely known for its use of Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) based on a mixed reference period.  The other committees mentioned, while involved in poverty estimation, did not propose this specific methodology as their primary recommendation.  The Lakdawala, Dandekar, and Alagh committees used different approaches or focused on other aspects of poverty and development.  Therefore, only the pairing of the Tendulkar Committee with the described poverty computation method is accurate.  The question's distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of poverty estimation methodologies in India and their association with specific committees.  A superficial understanding might lead to incorrect selections.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mission/Sub-mission                          National Skill Development Mission (NSDM) Submission

2. Overseas employment                         :   Yes
3. Leveraging of public infrastructure         :   Yes
4. Promotion of traditional crafts               :   No
5. Skill development for specific industries     :   Yes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Skill Development Mission (NSDM) encompasses a broad range of initiatives aimed at improving the skills of the Indian workforce.  Institutional training, overseas employment facilitation, and leveraging public infrastructure are all core components of NSDM's objectives.  Skill development for specific industries is also a major focus. However, the promotion of traditional crafts, while potentially relevant to broader skill development goals, isn't a direct or primary sub-mission of the NSDM.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the scope and specific activities undertaken by the NSDM.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options (like traditional crafts) challenges the candidate to recall the precise focus of NSDM's stated objectives.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Strategy                                      POSHAN Abhiyaan Strategy
1. Inter-sectoral convergence for service delivery: Yes
2. Use of technology (ICT) for growth monitoring: Yes
3. Focus on urban areas exclusively             : No
4. Financial assistance to NGOs only           : No
5. Community participation                     : Yes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The POSHAN Abhiyaan (National Nutrition Mission) in India employs a multi-pronged approach.  Key strategies include inter-sectoral convergence for better service delivery, utilizing technology (ICT) for real-time growth monitoring of women and children, and encouraging active community participation. Options 3 and 4 are incorrect because POSHAN Abhiyaan is not limited to urban areas and doesn't solely rely on NGO funding. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the implementation strategies of a major government initiative, requiring them to distinguish between core strategies and peripheral activities. The distractors aim to test the candidate's detailed understanding rather than superficial knowledge.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                   National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) Inclusion
1. Years of schooling                          : Yes
2. Literacy rate                              : No
3. Life expectancy                            : Yes
4. Per capita income                          : No
5. Child mortality rate                        : Yes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) in India uses a composite measure incorporating various dimensions of poverty.  Years of schooling, life expectancy, and child mortality rates are key indicators included in the MPI.  Literacy rate and per capita income, while relevant to overall poverty, are not direct components of the MPI's multidimensional framework. The question challenges the candidate's understanding of the specific indicators used in a complex development index. Including plausible but incorrect options tests for a precise understanding of the MPI's composition.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Unemployment                         Definition
1. Frictional unemployment                    :   Unemployment due to changes in technology or demand for products
2. Structural unemployment                   :   Unemployment due to changes in technology or demand for products
3. Cyclical unemployment                     :   Unemployment due to seasonal changes in demand
4. Disguised unemployment                    :   Unemployment where workers are seemingly employed but their marginal productivity is zero

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Structural unemployment accurately describes joblessness resulting from technological shifts or changes in product demand.  Disguised unemployment refers to a situation where individuals appear employed but contribute little or nothing to overall output.  Frictional unemployment relates to temporary unemployment between jobs, while cyclical unemployment is tied to economic cycles. The question tests understanding of different types of unemployment and their defining characteristics.  Including closely related but not entirely accurate options (like frictional unemployment being linked to technological change) makes the question more challenging.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Objective                                     Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) Objective

2. Providing universal access to public health services: No
3. Augmenting facilities for medical education      : Yes
4. Focusing solely on primary healthcare            : No
5. Strengthening rural healthcare infrastructure     : Yes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) aims to improve healthcare infrastructure and medical education in India.  Correcting regional imbalances in tertiary healthcare and augmenting facilities for quality medical education are key objectives.  Strengthening rural healthcare, though not the primary focus, is also indirectly addressed.  However, PMSSY doesn't aim for universal access to *all* public health services or focus exclusively on primary healthcare. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of a significant government healthcare scheme, demanding precise understanding of its objectives.  The distractors challenge the candidate to recall specific details rather than relying on general knowledge about healthcare policy.

   Economist                                 Concept
1. Dadabhai Naoroji                           :   Poverty measurable development indicator in Indian subcontinent
2. Romesh Chandra Dutt                        :   Detailed analysis of British drain of wealth from India
3. V.K.R.V. Rao                              :   Extensive work on poverty and development in India
4. M. Ranade                                 :   Contributions to Indian economic thought

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji is renowned for his pioneering work on quantifying poverty and the drain of wealth from India under British rule. Romesh Chandra Dutt also significantly contributed to the understanding of the economic exploitation of India during colonial times. V.K.R.V. Rao made extensive contributions to the study of poverty and development in post-independence India.  M. Ranade's contributions were significant, but not specifically focused on a poverty indicator in the way Naoroji’s work was. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of prominent economists and their key contributions to Indian economic thought. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the specific focus of each economist's work.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sector                                      Percentage of Workforce (1999-2000)
1. Primary Sector (Agriculture & Mining)    :    75%
2. Secondary Sector (Manufacturing, etc.)  :    16%
3. Tertiary/Service Sector                   :    24%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided data accurately reflects the distribution of the Indian workforce across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors in 1999-2000.  The primary sector, encompassing agriculture and mining, constituted the largest portion of employment, exceeding three-fourths of the total workforce. This dominance highlights India's agrarian economy at the time. The secondary sector, involving manufacturing, construction, and related industries, employed a significantly smaller percentage, around 16%.  Finally, the tertiary or service sector, encompassing trade, transport, and other services, held approximately 24% of the workforce.  These figures underscore the sectoral composition of India's employment landscape at the turn of the millennium, with a heavy reliance on agriculture and a growing presence of the service sector. All three pairs are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                       Percentage of Workforce in Primary Sector
1. 1972-73                                  :    74%

3. 1993-94                                  :    64%
4. 1999-2000                               :    60.4%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question presents data on the changing share of the workforce engaged in the primary sector (primarily agriculture) over several years.  The figures illustrate a consistent decline in the proportion of workers employed in this sector over time. This trend reflects a shift away from agrarian employment towards other sectors,  consistent with broader patterns of economic development in India.  The data points show a gradual decrease from approximately 74% in 1972-73 to 60.4% in 1999-2000, indicating the ongoing transition of the Indian economy.  Each pair accurately reflects the reported percentage for the corresponding year. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Employment Status                   Percentage of Workforce (1999-2000)
1. Self-Employed                         :    52.6%
2. Regular Salaried Employees           :    14.6%
3. Casual Wage Labourers                 :    32.8%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question focuses on the distribution of the Indian workforce across different employment statuses in 1999-2000.  The data indicates that self-employment was the dominant form of employment, accounting for a substantial majority (52.6%) of the workforce.  This reflects the prevalence of small businesses and individual enterprises within the Indian economy. Regular salaried employment, characterized by formal jobs with stable wages and benefits, constituted a considerably smaller portion (14.6%). Casual wage labor, representing temporary or irregular employment, made up a significant segment (32.8%). The figures highlight the characteristics of the Indian labor market, with a large informal sector and a relatively small formal sector. All three pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the distribution of workforce in India (1999-2000), consider the following pairs:**

    Region                     Employment Status
1. Rural                      :  Predominantly Self-Employed and Casual Wage Labourers
2. Urban                      :  Higher Proportion of Regular Salaried Employees
3. Both Rural and Urban     :    Significant Presence of Self-Employed Workers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question examines the regional variations in employment patterns within India during 1999-2000. Rural areas showed a higher concentration of self-employed individuals and casual wage laborers, reflecting the agricultural nature of rural livelihoods. Urban areas, in contrast, exhibited a more significant proportion of regular salaried employees due to the greater presence of formal sector jobs.  Across both rural and urban areas, self-employment remained a substantial form of employment.  The pairs correctly capture these regional disparities and overall employment trends.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**5.  With reference to the Indian workforce, consider the following pairs:**

    Characteristic                     Data Point (1999-2000)
1. Total Workforce                    :    400 million (approximately)
2. Gender Distribution               :    70% Male, 30% Female (approximately)
3. Rural Workforce Composition     :     More than three-fourths of female workforce in primary sector


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge about the overall size, gender composition, and sectoral distribution of the Indian workforce around 1999-2000.  The total workforce was indeed approximately 400 million, reflecting the vast size of India's labor pool.  A significant gender disparity existed, with men forming a larger proportion (approximately 70%) of the workforce compared to women (approximately 30%).  Finally, a substantial majority of female workers were concentrated in the primary sector (agriculture), highlighting the gendered nature of employment in rural India.  All three pairs accurately reflect the given data points. Therefore, the correct answer is (d).


**6. With reference to employment in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Category of Worker              Description
1. Self-Employed                     : Owns and operates an enterprise
2. Casual Wage Labourer              :  Irregular, short-term employment
3. Regular Salaried Employee         : Employed by an enterprise with regular wages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question focuses on defining different categories of workers based on their employment characteristics.  Self-employed individuals are those who own and operate their businesses or enterprises. Casual wage laborers are those who work on a temporary basis, often without regular employment contracts or benefits. Regular salaried employees work for established organizations receiving regular wages and typically enjoying various employment benefits. All three pairs accurately define the respective worker categories.  Therefore, all are correctly matched.


**7.  With reference to India's economic sectors, consider the following pairs:**

    Industrial Division                    Examples of Activities
1. Agriculture                             :  Farming, livestock rearing, fishing
2. Manufacturing                          : Textile mills, powerlooms, factories
3. Services                               : Trade, transport, finance, IT


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses understanding of the classification of economic activities in India into different industrial divisions.  Agriculture encompasses a broad range of activities related to farming, animal husbandry, and fisheries. Manufacturing includes industries that process raw materials into finished goods. The service sector, encompassing trade, transport, finance, and information technology, represents a significant and growing part of the Indian economy. All three pairs correctly link the industrial division with illustrative examples of activities. Therefore, all are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the growth of employment and GDP in India (1960-2000), consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic                            Observation
1. GDP Growth                             :  Positive and higher than employment growth
2. Employment Growth                      : Stable rate of around 2%
3. Late 1990s Trend                       :   Declining employment growth, widening gap between GDP and employment growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question deals with the relationship between employment growth and GDP growth in India between 1960 and 2000.  During this period, GDP growth was generally positive and outpaced employment growth.  Employment growth showed a relatively stable rate of around 2%.  In the late 1990s, a concerning trend emerged: employment growth started slowing down while GDP growth continued, leading to a widening gap – a phenomenon often referred to as "jobless growth". All three pairs accurately reflect the characteristics of this period's economic trends. Therefore, all are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to casualisation of the workforce in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Time Period                         Trend
1. 1972-2000                         :  Shift from self-employment and regular salaried employment to casual wage work
2. Post-Independence Era              : Deterioration in the quality of employment despite planned development
3. Recent Decades                      : Increasing proportion of casual laborers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question addresses the phenomenon of casualisation of the workforce in India. Between 1972 and 2000, a notable shift occurred from more stable forms of employment (self-employment and regular salaried jobs) to an increase in casual wage work, reflecting changes in the structure of the Indian economy.  Since independence, despite various development plans aimed at providing better livelihoods, the quality of employment has often been criticized for deteriorating, with a greater reliance on casual and precarious work.  In recent decades, the trend of increasing casual labor has continued.  All three pairs accurately reflect these aspects of casualisation. Therefore, all are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to the formal and informal sectors in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Sector                                  Characteristics
1. Formal Sector                           :  Includes public sector establishments and private sector establishments employing 10 or more hired workers
2. Informal Sector                         :  Includes millions of farmers, agricultural laborers, and self-employed individuals without hired workers
3. Formal Sector Workers                   : Generally enjoy social security benefits


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question examines the distinctions between the formal and informal sectors in the Indian economy. The formal sector is defined by the presence of larger establishments (public sector and private sector firms employing 10 or more workers), providing relatively better working conditions and benefits. The informal sector comprises a vast majority of the workforce, predominantly consisting of small enterprises, self-employed individuals, and those in casual employment, often lacking social security and protection.  Workers in the formal sector typically enjoy social security benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and other protections.  All three pairs accurately differentiate between the two sectors and their characteristics.  Therefore, all are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                   Value/Characteristic in China (2003)

2. Life expectancy at birth (Years)           :   71.6
3. GDP per capita (PPP US$)                 :   5003
4. People below poverty line (%)              :   16.6
5. Maternal Mortality Rate (per lakh births) :   56

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched with the data on China's development indicators in 2003, as presented in the source material.  The HDI value of 0.755, life expectancy of 71.6 years, GDP per capita (PPP) of US$5,003, poverty rate of 16.6%, and maternal mortality rate of 56 per lakh births are all accurate reflections of China's developmental status during that period.  These indicators showcase China's relatively strong performance in human development compared to its neighbors, India and Pakistan, highlighting its progress in economic growth, health, and poverty reduction. The other options are incorrect because they omit one or more of these correctly matched pairs.  A complete understanding of China's developmental trajectory requires considering all these interconnected indicators.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                             Sectoral Contribution to GDP (2003) - Agriculture
1. India                                   :   23%
2. China                                   :   15%
3. Pakistan                                 :   23%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  In 2003, the agricultural sector's contribution to the GDP was 23% for both India and Pakistan.  China's agricultural contribution to GDP was significantly lower at 15%.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs involving erroneous data for the contribution of the agricultural sector to the GDP of India, China, and Pakistan.  Understanding the sectoral composition of GDP is crucial for analyzing a country's economic structure and development strategy. The differences highlighted here reflect varying levels of economic diversification and industrialization across these nations.


**3. With reference to India's economic development, consider the following pairs:**

   Decade                                  Employment Growth Rate (%)
1. 1960-1970                              :   2.1
2. 1970-1980                              :   1.9
3. 1980-1990                              :   2.03
4. 1990-2000                              :   1.73
5. 1950-1960                               :   3.3

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the approximate employment growth rates in India during those decades.  The data is based on analysis of employment trends during the specified periods and reveals a consistent, albeit fluctuating, employment growth rate of around 2%.  Option (d) is incorrect because the employment growth rate for 1950-1960 is inaccurate. The other options are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs. Analyzing employment growth alongside GDP growth provides insights into the nature of economic development (jobless growth).


**4. With reference to India's workforce distribution in 1999-2000, consider the following pairs:**

   Sector                                    Percentage of Workforce
1. Primary Sector                           :   60.4%
2. Secondary Sector                         :   15.8%
3. Tertiary/Service Sector                   :   23.8%
4. Primary Sector (Rural)                   :   75.1%
5. Tertiary/Service Sector (Urban)          :   59.1%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The data reflects the distribution of India's workforce across primary (agriculture and mining), secondary (manufacturing, construction), and tertiary (services) sectors in 1999-2000. The high proportion in the primary sector highlights India's agrarian economy.  The breakdown further shows the significant difference between rural and urban workforce distribution.  Understanding this sectoral distribution is crucial for policy-making related to employment generation and economic diversification.  The other options are incorrect as they omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                      Poverty Rate (All India) according to Tendulkar Committee
1. 1973-74                                  :   54.9%

(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched according to the Tendulkar Committee's poverty estimates.  The data shows a significant decline in poverty rates in India over the period, reflecting overall economic progress. However, it's important to note that poverty estimation methodologies and the poverty line itself are subject to debate and revision, influencing the interpretation of these figures. The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  Analyzing poverty trends helps in evaluating the effectiveness of poverty alleviation programs and informs future policy.


**6.  With reference to  India's poverty estimation, consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                  Poverty Rate (All India) in 2011-12
1.  Lakdawala Committee                     :   21.9%
2.  Tendulkar Committee                      :   21.9%
3.  Rangarajan Committee                    :   29.5%
4.  Alagh Committee                          :   38.2%
5.  Expert Group (1989)                     :   27.5%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2,3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Tendulkar Committee estimated the all-India poverty rate at 21.9% in 2011-12, while the Rangarajan Committee estimated it at 29.5% for the same year.  The discrepancies reflect differing methodologies and poverty line definitions. The other options are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched poverty rates from various committees with the year 2011-12.  The variation in poverty estimates highlights the complexities in measuring poverty and the importance of understanding the methodologies employed.  Policy decisions related to poverty reduction must consider these methodological challenges.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                         Focus Area
1. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Swaniyojan Yojana  :   Rural entrepreneurship
2. Atal Innovation Mission (AIM)           :   National innovation ecosystem
3. Chunauti                                  :   Startups in Tier-II towns
4. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana    :   Rural infrastructure development
5. DigiSaksham                              :   Digital literacy for youth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Swaniyojan Yojana is indeed focused on promoting rural entrepreneurship. The Atal Innovation Mission aims to build a national innovation ecosystem.  Chunauti specifically targets startups in Tier-II towns. DigiSaksham enhances digital literacy among youth. However, the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana is primarily a skill development program, not focused on rural infrastructure development. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer because it correctly identifies the matched pairs while excluding the mismatched one. Understanding these government schemes is crucial for comprehending the strategies employed for inclusive growth and skill development.


**8. With reference to India's infrastructure, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Infrastructure                      Characteristic
1. Energy Infrastructure                     :   Significant gap between consumer demand and supply
2. Health Infrastructure                     :   Wide gap between rural and urban healthcare access
3. Social Infrastructure                     :   Uneven distribution across rural and urban areas
4. Economic Infrastructure                  :   Significant investment in renewable energy sources
5. Transportation Infrastructure             :   Focus on developing rural infrastructure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe characteristics of India's infrastructure.  The energy sector faces a significant supply-demand gap.  Health infrastructure shows a disparity between rural and urban areas.  Social infrastructure (education, sanitation, etc.) suffers from uneven distribution. However, while there is increasing investment in renewable energy, it does not represent the dominant characteristic of India's energy infrastructure. Similarly, while there is a focus on rural infrastructure development, it is not a singular characteristic defining transportation infrastructure. Therefore, option (a) is correct as it accurately identifies the matched pairs while excluding the mismatched ones.  Understanding these aspects of India's infrastructure is crucial for development planning and policy formulation.


**9. With reference to challenges in achieving inclusive growth in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Challenge                                   Specific Concern
1. Poverty                                    :   Lack of education and skills among the poor
2. Employment                                 :   Predominance of low-productivity, unorganized sector jobs
3. Agriculture                               :   Fragmented land holdings and low yields
4. Social Development                         :   High maternal mortality rates
5. Regional Disparities                       :   High per capita income disparity between states like Punjab and Bihar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All pairs accurately represent challenges related to inclusive growth in India.  Poverty is linked to a lack of education and skills, limiting employment opportunities.  The employment sector is characterized by a large unorganized sector with low productivity and wages. The agricultural sector faces issues of fragmented land holdings, low yields, and dependence on monsoons. Social development lags due to factors like high maternal mortality rates, poor health infrastructure, and gender disparities. Finally, regional disparities are evident in varying levels of development and income across different states.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer because it correctly identifies all matched pairs.  Addressing these interconnected challenges is crucial for achieving sustainable and equitable growth in India.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Issue in Women's Health (India)         Specific Observation
1. Female Foeticide                        :   Deterioration in child sex ratio
2. Child Marriage                           :   High rates of child marriage and early motherhood
3. Nutritional Anaemia                      :   High prevalence of anaemia among women
4. Maternal Mortality                       :   High rates of maternal mortality due to abortions
5. Access to Healthcare                     :   Significant disparities in access between urban and rural areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The deterioration in the child sex ratio is a direct consequence of female foeticide.  High rates of child marriage contribute to early motherhood and associated health risks.  Nutritional anaemia is a widespread problem among Indian women, leading to various health complications.  Maternal mortality rates are significantly high, with abortions being a major cause.  Finally, access to healthcare is unevenly distributed, with rural areas facing greater challenges.  Therefore, option (d) is correct as it includes all correctly matched pairs.  Addressing these issues is crucial for improving women's health and overall human development in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Associated Institution
1. Shishu, Kishor, and Tarun schemes     :   Regional Rural Banks
2. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana           :   Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Limited (MUDRA)
3. Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana                :   Small Industries Development Bank of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) is indeed a scheme by the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Limited (MUDRA).  MUDRA's primary function is to provide funding to micro and small businesses.  The Shishu, Kishor, and Tarun schemes, however, are part of the PMMY, not specifically associated with Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) although RRBs might be involved in disbursing loans under PMMY.  Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana is a central government scheme focused on the welfare of tribal communities and isn't directly linked to the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). SIDBI primarily focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                      Description
1. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme              :   Promotes FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
2. Gold Monetization Scheme                :   Reduces India’s dependence on gold imports
3.  Commercial Paper                       :   Long-term unsecured promissory note

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gold Monetization Scheme aims to bring idle gold held by households into the economy and reduce reliance on imports. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme serves a similar purpose, encouraging investment in government securities backed by gold, thus reducing import pressure.  Commercial Paper, however, is a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds, not a long-term instrument. Therefore, only pair 2 accurately describes the nature of the financial instrument. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrect pairings.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept/Policy                  Characteristic
1.  Money Multiplier                         :   Decreases with an increase in cash reserve ratio
2.  Legal Tender Money                      :   Money a creditor is compelled to accept
3.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)           :   Compares prices of goods in different countries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A higher cash reserve ratio (CRR) directly reduces the money multiplier as banks have less money available for lending. Legal tender money is, by definition, currency that a creditor must accept for settling debts. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) uses price comparisons across countries to determine exchange rates. All three pairs accurately reflect the given concepts. Therefore, option (d) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Yojana               Primary Objective
1. Kisan Credit Card Scheme              :   Construction of family houses
2. National AYUSH Mission                :   Improvement of AYUSH education
3. Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA):   Improve quality of private educational institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National AYUSH Mission indeed aims to improve AYUSH education and healthcare access.  The Kisan Credit Card scheme focuses on providing credit to farmers for agricultural inputs and expenses, not for family housing. RUSA's primary goal is to improve the quality of higher education, not solely to enhance private institutions. Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include mismatched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                      Interpretation of Increase
1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER):   Indicates rupee appreciation
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)    :   Indicates improvement in trade competitiveness
3.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)             :   Indicates a decrease in inflation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A rise in NEER signifies that the rupee has appreciated against a basket of currencies.  An increase in REER suggests improved trade competitiveness.  However, an increase in CPI indicates inflation, not a decrease.  Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term/Policy                   Description
1.  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)         :   Decided by each individual bank
2.  Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)         :   Incentive given by a bank to a merchant
3.  Seigniorage                            :   Profit from money creation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a regulatory requirement, not determined by individual banks. The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a charge, not an incentive, to merchants for accepting card payments.  Seigniorage is the profit a government or central bank makes from issuing currency. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to including mismatched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Inflation                         Cause/Contributing Factor
1. Demand-pull inflation                     :   Expansionary policies
2. Cost-push inflation                       :   Inflation-indexing wages
3. Stagflation                               :   Supply shocks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation arises from increased aggregate demand, often fueled by expansionary policies. Cost-push inflation stems from rising production costs, such as wages indexed to inflation. Stagflation, a combination of high inflation and unemployment, is often linked to supply shocks, such as oil price increases.  All three pairs accurately reflect the causal relationships.  Therefore, option (d) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy/Measure                 Impact on Indian Rupee
1. Curbing imports                         :   Stops slide of Indian rupee
2. Easing external commercial borrowing  :   Stops slide of Indian rupee
3. Following an expansionary monetary policy:   Supports slide of Indian rupee

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Reducing imports improves the trade balance, potentially strengthening the rupee. Easing external commercial borrowing increases foreign currency inflow, supporting the rupee. An expansionary monetary policy, however, tends to weaken the currency due to increased money supply.  Thus, only the first two pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inclusion of mismatched pairs.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Variable/Concept              Associated Feature
1. Potential GDP                            :   Determined by factors like capital stock
2. Real GDP                                :   Calculated using constant prices
3.  GDP Deflator                           :   Ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Potential GDP is the maximum output an economy can produce with its existing resources. Real GDP is calculated using a base year's prices to adjust for inflation. The GDP deflator is indeed the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP, providing a measure of price changes.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.


**10. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument/Policy              Characteristic
1. Certificate of Deposit                   :  Short-term instrument
2. Call money                               :  Used for interbank transactions
3. Zero-coupon Bonds                       :  Interest-bearing short-term bonds

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Certificates of Deposit are typically medium to long-term instruments. Call money is indeed used for short-term interbank lending and borrowing. Zero-coupon bonds don't pay periodic interest; the return comes from the difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity. Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inclusion of mismatched pairs.


**11. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Investment                       Characteristic
1. Foreign currency convertible bonds      :   Included in FDI
2. Global depository receipts               :   Included in FDI
3. Non-resident external deposits         :   Not included in FDI

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency convertible bonds are debt instruments, not equity investments that typically characterize FDI. Global depository receipts (GDRs) represent ownership in a company, often considered part of FDI. Non-resident external deposits are short-term investments, not FDI. Therefore, only the third pair is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to including mismatched pairs.


**12. With reference to ‘Urban Cooperative Banks’ in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                  Description
1. Supervision and regulation             :   By local boards set up by State Governments
2. Issuance of shares                      :   Can issue equity and preference shares
3. Brought under Banking Regulation Act, 1949: Through an Amendment in 1966

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not local boards. They are authorized to issue equity and preference shares.  The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, was amended in 1966 to include UCBs under its purview.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because of the inclusion of mismatched pairs.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to Indian economic development, infrastructure, and human capital formation.  Each question adheres to the specified format and includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Infrastructure Category          :     Example
1. Economic Infrastructure          :     Educational Institutions
2. Social Infrastructure            :     Power Stations
3. Economic Infrastructure          :     Communication Facilities
4. Social Infrastructure            :     Hospitals
5. Economic Infrastructure          :     Irrigation Facilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Economic infrastructure refers to the foundational elements essential for economic production and trade, including transportation networks (roads, railways, ports, airports), energy infrastructure (power stations, oil and gas pipelines), and irrigation systems.  Social infrastructure, on the other hand, focuses on the well-being and development of the population, such as education, healthcare, housing, and sanitation.

Therefore, power stations and hospitals are correctly classified under economic and social infrastructure respectively.  Communication facilities and irrigation facilities are correctly paired with economic infrastructure.  However, educational institutions fall under social infrastructure, making option (b) the only correct pairing. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes a wrongly matched pair. Option (c) wrongly matches power stations and hospitals with the wrong categories. Option (d) includes all the pairs, with multiple mismatches.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the different types of infrastructure and their roles in development.


**2. With reference to India's infrastructure development, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                  :        Meaning/Related Concept
1. Bharat Nirman                          :        Focus on rural infrastructure
2. Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)       :        Private-Public Partnerships (PPP)
3. Special Economic Zones (SEZ)         :        Rural development initiatives
4. Build Operate Transfer (BOT)          :        Public sector-led infrastructure projects
5. Private Public Partnership (PPP)     :        Infrastructure financing model


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Bharat Nirman was a flagship program of the Indian government focusing on rural infrastructure development, including rural roads, irrigation, housing, and drinking water.  Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) are often used in Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs) to manage specific infrastructure projects. PPPs themselves are a financing model involving both public and private sectors.  Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are designated areas with special economic regulations to attract foreign investment, not directly focused on rural development. The Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model is a type of PPP where a private entity builds, operates, and then transfers an infrastructure asset to the government after a specified period. Thus, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of Indian government initiatives and infrastructure development terminology.


**3. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Human Capital             :       Example
1. Investment in Education            :       On-the-job training
2. Investment in Health                :       Preventive medicine
3. On-the-job Training                :       Migration
4. Migration                           :       Acquiring market information
5. Information Acquisition             :       Expenditure on health infrastructure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Investment in education encompasses formal schooling, vocational training, and other learning experiences that enhance knowledge and skills. Investment in health includes preventive measures like vaccinations, curative interventions, and improvements in sanitation and access to clean water. On-the-job training is a specific form of skill development within the workplace. Migration involves movement of people in search of better opportunities, and information acquisition is crucial for making informed decisions about investments in human capital.  Expenditure on health infrastructure is directly related to health investment. Only pair 2 correctly links investment in health with preventive medicine.  The other options contain several mismatches. This question tests the candidate’s ability to categorize different factors contributing to human capital formation.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Poverty Estimation Method/Committee  :        Year
1.  Expert Group (1962)                  :        2005
2.  Working Group under Dr. Y. K. Alagh (1977) :        1973-74
3.  Expert Group (1989) under Prof. D. T. Lakdawala :      1993-94
4.  Prof. Suresh D. Tendulkar (2005)       :        2011-12
5.  C. Rangarajan (2012)                  :        1983


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge about different committees and their respective years of operation related to poverty estimation in India.  While the names and years are presented in a jumbled order, and some years are incorrect, the correct matches are the Lakdawala committee (1989) with the 1993-94 poverty estimates and the Alagh committee (1977) with estimates from 1973-74.  The other options include incorrect pairings. This requires recall of specific historical information related to poverty estimation in India.


**5. With reference to India's employment scenario, consider the following pairs:**

   Sector                               :       Characteristic
1. Primary Sector                       :        Highest proportion of female workforce
2. Secondary Sector                     :        Predominantly informal employment
3. Tertiary/Service Sector              :        Significant growth in recent years
4. Formal Sector                         :        High job security and social security benefits
5. Informal Sector                       :        High proportion of casual wage labourers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The primary sector (agriculture, mining) employs a large portion of India's female workforce. The tertiary/service sector has shown significant growth, particularly in recent years.  Formal sector jobs generally offer better job security and social security benefits. The informal sector is characterized by a significant number of casual wage labourers. The secondary sector, while having some informal aspects, is not entirely defined by informal employment.  Option (b) accurately reflects the characteristics of the sectors mentioned. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of India's employment structure and its various sectors.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on economic concepts and policies relevant to the Indian context.  Note that the difficulty level is intentionally high, requiring precise recall and analytical skills.


**1. With reference to measures of India's economic development, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                 Condition Affecting Interpretation
    1. Increase in absolute real GNP           :   Poverty and unemployment remain high
    2. Increase in per capita real GNP        :   Industrial output lags significantly behind agricultural output
    3. High savings rate                      :  High capital-output ratio
    4.  High capital formation                  :   Weak administrative machinery hampers implementation


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 3 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because all the pairs accurately reflect situations where commonly used indicators of economic development might be misleading.  

* **Pair 1:**  A rise in absolute real GNP doesn't guarantee improved development if poverty and unemployment persist, indicating unequal distribution of wealth.
* **Pair 2:**  Similarly, an increase in per capita real GNP can be deceptive if industrial growth (a crucial element of modern economic development) lags behind agricultural output, implying an underdeveloped industrial base.
* **Pair 3:** High savings rates don't automatically translate to high output if the capital-output ratio is high, meaning more capital is needed to produce each unit of output, suggesting inefficiency.
* **Pair 4:**  High capital formation may not lead to significant output increases if weak administrative machinery hinders effective investment and project implementation.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  They represent partial understandings of the complexities involved in interpreting economic indicators.  The question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the limitations of simple economic indicators and understand the nuances of economic development.


**2. With reference to economic indicators and their interpretations, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                  Implication
    1.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rate :   Calculated by comparing prices of a standard basket of goods across nations
    2.  India's ranking as sixth largest economy:   Based on nominal GDP, not PPP
    3.  CPI weighting of food                  :   Higher than in WPI
    4.  WPI                                   :   Captures changes in service prices


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the characteristics of the respective indicators.

* **Pair 1:** PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of a common basket of goods and services across different countries to account for differences in purchasing power.
* **Pair 3:** The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in India gives a higher weight to food items compared to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), reflecting the significance of food in household budgets.

Pair 2 is incorrect because India's ranking as the sixth-largest economy (at the time the data was collected) was based on PPP, not nominal GDP.  Nominal GDP does not adjust for differences in the cost of living between countries. Pair 4 is incorrect because the WPI, by its nature, primarily focuses on the price changes of wholesale goods and does not comprehensively capture service price fluctuations; the CPI does. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of different economic indicators and their accurate interpretation, highlighting potential pitfalls in relying on single indicators without considering their limitations.


**3. With reference to market demand and its determinants, consider the following pairs:**

    Factor Affecting Market Demand             Effect
    1. Price increase of substitute good        :   Market demand for the original good decreases
    2. Price increase of complement good       :   Market demand for the original good increases
    3. Increase in income for inferior good     :    Market demand for the original good decreases
    4. Fall in price of original good           :   Market demand for the original good increases

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer. Let's analyze each pair:

* **Pair 1:** If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers will switch to the relatively cheaper original good, increasing its demand. This pair is incorrectly matched.
* **Pair 2:**  If the price of a complementary good increases, the demand for the original good will decrease because consumers are less likely to buy both goods when one is more expensive. This pair is incorrectly matched.
* **Pair 3:** For an inferior good, an increase in consumer income leads to a decrease in demand as consumers shift to superior substitutes. This pair is correctly matched.
* **Pair 4:** A fall in the price of a good generally leads to an increase in its quantity demanded, a fundamental principle of the law of demand. This pair is correctly matched.

Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The question tests the candidate’s understanding of the law of demand and the relationship between demand for substitute and complementary goods.  It also assesses their ability to analyze the effect of income changes on demand for different types of goods.


**4. With reference to exchange rates and their implications for the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

    Exchange Rate Indicator                      Implication
    1. Increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER): Rupee depreciation
    2. Increase in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER): Improvement in trade competitiveness
    3. Increasing domestic inflation relative to other countries: Increasing divergence between NEER and REER
    4.  A falling rupee                              : Increased import costs


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 3 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Let's examine each pair:

* **Pair 1:** An increase in NEER indicates rupee appreciation, not depreciation.  NEER measures the value of the rupee against a basket of currencies, weighted by trade volumes.  An increase signifies the rupee has strengthened. This pair is incorrectly matched.
* **Pair 2:** An increase in REER, which adjusts NEER for inflation differentials, indicates improved trade competitiveness as domestic goods become relatively cheaper compared to imports. This pair is correctly matched.
* **Pair 3:**  If domestic inflation rises faster than in other countries, the REER will appreciate more slowly than the NEER, leading to a widening gap between them. This pair is correctly matched.
* **Pair 4:** A falling rupee (depreciation) makes imports more expensive, impacting the trade balance and inflation. This pair is incorrectly matched in its implication.

The question tests the candidate's understanding of exchange rate concepts (NEER and REER), their impact on trade competitiveness, and the relationship between inflation and exchange rates.  It assesses their ability to analyze the implications of exchange rate movements for the Indian economy.


**5. With reference to the Indian Government's fiscal policy and its management, consider the following pairs:**

    Fiscal Policy Element                       Description
    1. Fiscal Stimulus                          :   Intensive government action to curb economic activity.
    2. Value Added Tax (VAT)                    :   Tax levied on final consumption only.
    3. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)         :   More stable than Foreign Institutional Investment (FII)
    4.  Authorization for fund withdrawal       :   Comes from the President of India

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) None
    (d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

* **Pair 1:** A fiscal stimulus is designed to boost economic activity, not curb it.  This is usually done through increased government spending or tax cuts to stimulate demand.
* **Pair 2:** VAT is a multi-stage tax levied at each stage of production and distribution, with the final consumer ultimately bearing the burden. It's not solely a tax on final consumption.
* **Pair 3:** FII is generally considered less stable than FDI because it's more susceptible to short-term market fluctuations.  FDI represents long-term capital investments.
* **Pair 4:** The authorization for fund withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund of India comes from the Parliament, not the President.  The President only gives assent to the appropriation bills passed by Parliament.

The question aims to test the candidate's understanding of core fiscal policy concepts, differentiating between stimulus and austerity, understanding the nature of VAT, distinguishing between FDI and FII, and knowing the constitutional procedure for government spending. The inclusion of all incorrect pairs makes this a challenging question requiring precise knowledge.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance aspects related to the Indian economy.  Each question adheres to the specified format and difficulty level.  Note that some questions may require inferences from the given information, testing analytical skills beyond simple factual recall.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy Term             Description
1. Demand-pull inflation             :   Caused by rising interest rates
2. Fiscal stimulus                    :   Expansionary government spending
3. Inflation-indexing wages          :   Adjusting wages based on inflation
4. Tight monetary policy              :   Leads to capital flight
5. External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) :  Currency risk reduced by domestic currency devaluation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation is primarily caused by increased aggregate demand exceeding aggregate supply, often fueled by expansionary policies and increased purchasing power, not rising interest rates.  Rising interest rates generally curb inflation.  Fiscal stimulus, through increased government spending, directly boosts aggregate demand, contributing to demand-pull inflation. Inflation-indexing wages protects workers from the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation.  A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve (for example, raising interest rates) can lead to capital flight as investors seek higher returns elsewhere.  Devaluation of the domestic currency actually *increases* the currency risk associated with ECBs for the borrower, as it increases the amount they have to repay in their own currency.


**2. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Action                     Scenario
1. Buying government securities   :   Inflation is too high
2. Selling dollars in the market    :   The rupee is rapidly appreciating
3. Buying dollars                  :    Interest rates in the USA rise


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) typically *sells* government securities to curb inflation (reduce money supply), not buy them.  If the rupee is rapidly appreciating, the RBI would likely *buy* dollars to prevent excessive appreciation and maintain exchange rate stability. If interest rates in the USA rise, it would likely lead to capital outflow from India, putting downward pressure on the rupee. The RBI would likely buy dollars to counter this outflow and support the rupee.


**3. With reference to "Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)" in the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Advantage of IIBs                Description
1. Reduced coupon rates for the government :  Investors are compensated for inflation
2. Protection from inflation uncertainty     :   Interest and capital gains are tax-exempt
3. Non-taxable returns                  :    Government borrowing costs are reduced


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Inflation-indexed bonds (IIBs) allow governments to reduce coupon rates (interest payments) because the principal is adjusted for inflation, reducing the real cost of borrowing. IIBs primarily offer investors protection against inflation uncertainty by adjusting the principal and/or interest payments based on the inflation rate. While some countries may offer tax advantages on IIBs, this is not a universal feature.  The tax treatment of IIBs varies by jurisdiction.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument            Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                :   Long-term unsecured promissory note
2. Certificate of Deposit             :   Short-term instrument issued by a corporation
3. Call money                         :   Long-term finance used for interbank transactions
4. Zero-coupon Bonds                 :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by commercial banks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term, *unsecured* promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term debt instruments issued by banks, not corporations.  Call money is a very short-term loan used for interbank transactions in the money market. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; instead, they are sold at a discount and repaid at face value at maturity.  Therefore, none of the given pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Policy                 Regulatory Body
1.  Scheduled Commercial Banks      :   SEBI
2.  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) :   IRDAI
3.  Systemically Important Insurers (SIIs)   :    RBI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Scheduled Commercial Banks are regulated primarily by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). NBFCs are regulated by multiple bodies depending on their specific activities, including the RBI, SEBI (for market-related activities), and IRDAI (for insurance-related activities).  Systemically Important Insurers (SIIs) are indeed designated and regulated by the IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India).


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Foreign Investment Type          Description
1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) :   Investment less than 10% of equity capital in a listed company
2. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI):   Investment through capital instruments in an unlisted company
3. Global Depository Receipt (GDR) :   Issued by an Overseas Depository Bank to US investors
4. American Depository Receipt (ADR) : A type of Foreign Portfolio Investment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

FDI involves investment of 10% or more of equity capital in a listed company or any investment in an unlisted company. FPI represents investments below the 10% threshold in listed companies. GDRs and ADRs are mechanisms facilitating foreign investment in shares of companies, and ADRs specifically involve US investors.  The description of ADRs is accurate; however, ADRs are not *exclusively* a type of FPI; they can also be associated with FDI depending on the percentage of ownership.


**7. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following pairs:**

    BoP Account Category           Type of Transaction
1. Current Account                  :   Loans from international agencies
2. Capital and Financial Account    :   Remittances from NRIs
3. Capital and Financial Account    :   Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Loans from international agencies are recorded under the capital and financial account of the BoP, as they represent capital flows. Remittances from NRIs and FDI are also correctly classified under the capital and financial account.  The current account primarily records transactions related to the trade of goods and services, income receipts and payments, and current transfers.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Monetary Policy Tool        Objective
1. Repo Rate                      :   Influences short-term interest rates
2. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)      :   Regulates money supply
3. Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) :   Manages liquidity in the money market
4. Open Market Operations (OMO)    :  Influences long-term interest rates


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The repo rate is the rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks, directly influencing short-term interest rates.  The CRR is the percentage of deposits banks must maintain with the RBI, thereby regulating money supply. The SLR mandates a minimum percentage of assets banks must hold in liquid form, influencing overall liquidity. OMOS (buying or selling government securities) directly impacts money supply, influencing short-term interest rates, but have indirect effects on long-term rates.  Therefore, 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to the Indian banking system, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                   Description
1. Base Rate                            :   Minimum lending rate for banks since April 2016
2. Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) :  Replaced BPLR in July 2010
3. External Benchmark                   :   Mandatory for linking all new floating rate loans since October 2019


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The base rate was the minimum lending rate before April 2016, when it was replaced by the MCLR. The MCLR replaced the BPLR in April 2016, not July 2010.  Linking lending rates to an external benchmark (like the repo rate) became mandatory for new floating-rate loans since October 2019 to improve monetary policy transmission.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Concept             Feature
1.  Systemically Important Institutions (SIIs) :   "Too Big to Fail" institutions
2.  Domestic Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) :   Asset size exceeding 2% of GDP
3.  Domestic Systemically Important NBFCs     :    Asset size exceeding Rs. 500 crore
4.  Economic Capital Framework (ECF)       :   Contingency Risk Buffer of 5.5% to 6.5% of balance sheet


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

SIIs are indeed often referred to as "too big to fail" due to the potential systemic risk of their failure. The criteria for DSIBs and DSINBFCS are correctly stated. The Bimal Jalan Committee's recommendation for the ECF included a contingency risk buffer within the specified range.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the subject matter, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                     |  Description/Impact
----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
1.  High Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) |  Indicates rupee depreciation
2.  High Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)  |  Indicates improved trade competitiveness
3.  Increase in CPI relative to global inflation | Causes increasing divergence between NEER and REER
4. Tight monetary policy of US Federal Reserve | May lead to capital flight from India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because it accurately reflects the relationships between the economic indicators and their descriptions. A high NEER indicates rupee appreciation, not depreciation. A high REER generally signifies a loss of trade competitiveness due to a relatively overvalued currency.  An increasing trend in domestic inflation compared to other countries will indeed cause a growing gap between NEER and REER (as the real exchange rate adjusts for inflation). Finally, a tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve often leads to capital flight from emerging markets like India as investors seek higher returns elsewhere. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the mismatches between the indicators and their described impacts, as explained above.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of exchange rate dynamics and their implications for the Indian economy.



**2. With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                     |  Characteristic
----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
1. Commercial Paper                       | Long-term unsecured promissory note
2. Certificate of Deposit                   | Short-term instrument issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks
3. Call Money                               | Short-term finance for interbank transactions
4. Zero Coupon Bonds                      | Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Call money is indeed a short-term funding mechanism used primarily for interbank transactions.  Commercial paper is a short-term, *unsecured* promissory note, not long-term. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term instruments issued by banks, not the RBI. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; their return comes from the difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include mismatched pairs, demonstrating a lack of understanding of these financial instruments. The question tests factual recall of financial terminology and an understanding of the characteristics of different short-term debt instruments.



**3. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy, consider the following pairs:**

   Monetary Policy Tool                 |  Description/Function
----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
1. Repo Rate                             | Interest rate at which RBI absorbs liquidity from banks
2. Reverse Repo Rate                     | Interest rate at which RBI provides overnight liquidity to banks
3. Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)      | Safety valve against liquidity shocks; borrowing above repo rate limit
4. Standing Deposit Facility (SDF)       | Allows banks to deposit unlimited amounts overnight at the reverse repo rate

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the description of the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) is accurate. The repo rate is the rate at which the RBI *lends* to banks, while the reverse repo rate is the rate at which it *borrows* from banks. The MSF does indeed serve as a safety valve, allowing banks to borrow beyond the repo limit at a penal rate. The SDF allows banks to deposit funds with the RBI, but the rate is typically linked to the repo rate, not the reverse repo rate, and there may be limits imposed. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings, showcasing a misunderstanding of the RBI’s monetary policy tools and their functions. This question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding monetary policy instruments.



**4. With reference to government budgeting in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Government Account                  |  Description/Source of Funds
----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
1. Consolidated Fund of India (CFI)     |  Receipts from sale of savings certificates
2. Contingency Fund of India           |  Meets unforeseen expenses pending parliamentary authorization
3. Public Account of India              |  All tax revenues received by the government
4. Revenue Receipts                     |  Loans raised by the government from the public

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the description of the Contingency Fund of India is accurate. The CFI receives all government revenues and loans, not just receipts from savings certificates.  The Public Account holds funds for specific purposes, not tax revenues. Revenue receipts do not include loans; they are non-redeemable funds. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings demonstrating a lack of knowledge about the different types of government accounts and their functions. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the Indian government's accounting system.


**5. With reference to India's fiscal policy, consider the following pairs:**

   Fiscal Deficit Measure                |  Description
----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
1. Revenue Deficit                     | Total borrowing by the government
2. Fiscal Deficit                       | Difference between revenue expenditure and revenue receipts
3. Primary Deficit                      | Fiscal deficit excluding interest payments on debt

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the definition of the primary deficit is correct. Revenue deficit is the difference between revenue expenditure and revenue receipts. Fiscal deficit is the difference between total expenditure and total receipts (excluding borrowing).  Option (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, showing a lack of understanding of the various government deficit measures. This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of key fiscal policy indicators.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy Term                     Description
1.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)          :   Interest and capital gains are non-taxable.
2.  Convertible Bonds                       :   Pay a higher interest rate due to equity exchange option.
3.  External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) :   Devaluation of domestic currency increases currency risk.
4.  Tight Monetary Policy of US Federal Reserve : Leads to decreased capital flight to India.
5.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     :  Increase indicates improved trade competitiveness.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 5 is correctly matched.  An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) does indeed signal an improvement in a country's trade competitiveness.  This is because REER adjusts the nominal exchange rate for differences in inflation rates between countries. A higher REER means the country's goods and services are relatively cheaper compared to those of its trading partners, boosting exports and improving trade competitiveness.

Let's examine why the other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from inflation; however, the taxability of interest and capital gains varies depending on the specific IIB structure and the tax laws of the issuing country. They are not universally non-taxable.

* **Pair 2:** Convertible bonds offer a lower interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds because of the option to convert into equity.  This lower rate compensates for the potential upside of equity appreciation.

* **Pair 3:** A devaluation of the domestic currency *decreases* the currency risk associated with ECBs. Devaluation makes the debt cheaper to repay in domestic currency terms.

* **Pair 4:** A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve typically *increases* capital flight from emerging markets like India, as investors seek higher returns in safer, developed markets.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Monetary Policy Instrument          Effect on Money Supply
1.  Increase in Repo Rate                 :   Increases money supply
2.  Increase in CRR                       :   Decreases money supply
3.  Open Market Purchase of Securities    :   Decreases money supply
4.  Increase in Reverse Repo Rate          :   Increases money supply
5.  Decrease in SLR                       :   Increases money supply

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.  An increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) compels banks to hold a larger percentage of their deposits as reserves with the RBI, reducing the amount available for lending and thus decreasing the money supply. Conversely, a decrease in the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) frees up more funds for banks to lend, thereby increasing the money supply.

The other pairs are incorrect because:

* **Pair 1:** Increasing the repo rate makes borrowing more expensive for banks, leading to a *decrease* in money supply as banks reduce lending.

* **Pair 3:** Open market *purchases* of securities by the RBI inject liquidity into the system, *increasing* the money supply. Open market *sales* would decrease it.

* **Pair 4:** Increasing the reverse repo rate encourages banks to park more funds with the RBI, thereby *decreasing* money supply.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Balance of Payments Account           Type of Transaction
1.  Current Account                       :   Foreign Direct Investment
2.  Capital Account                       :   Remittances
3.  Capital and Financial Account       :   Portfolio Investment
4.  Current Account                       :   Balance of Trade
5.  Capital and Financial Account       :   Foreign Loans

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched. The balance of trade (exports and imports of goods) is a key component of the current account in the balance of payments. Foreign loans represent capital inflows and are recorded under the capital and financial account.

The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** FDI is a capital flow and is recorded under the capital and financial account, not the current account.

* **Pair 2:** Remittances (personal transfers) are part of the current account, not the capital account.

* **Pair 3:** Portfolio investment (investments in stocks and bonds) is correctly categorized under the capital and financial account, but the other pairs are incorrect.



**4. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Macroeconomic Variable                Indicator of
1.  High Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER):   Rupee depreciation
2.  High Current Account Deficit           :   Improved trade balance
3.  High Inflation                          :    Increased purchasing power
4.  High Fiscal Deficit                     :    Increased government borrowing
5.  High Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) :   Improved trade competitiveness


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched. A high fiscal deficit indicates that the government is borrowing more, needing to fund the difference between its spending and revenue.  A high REER, as explained previously, reflects improved trade competitiveness.

The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** A high NEER indicates *appreciation* of the rupee, not depreciation.

* **Pair 2:** A high current account deficit indicates a *worsening*, not an improvement, in the trade balance.

* **Pair 3:** High inflation *erodes* purchasing power, not increases it.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                  Definition/Description
1.  Seigniorage                              :   Profit from money creation
2.  Managed Float Exchange Rate System     :   Central bank never intervenes in foreign exchange market
3.  Free Float Exchange Rate System         :   Central bank sometimes intervenes to manage volatility
4.  Deficit Financing through Central Bank Borrowing : Government borrows from the public to finance a budget deficit
5.  Bank Rate                               :   Interest rate at which RBI provides overnight liquidity to banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Seigniorage accurately describes the profit a central bank earns from money creation.  A free float system is correctly defined as a system where the central bank does not intervene in the foreign exchange market.

The other pairs are incorrect because:

* **Pair 2:** A managed float system is characterized by central bank intervention to manage exchange rate volatility.

* **Pair 4:** Deficit financing through central bank borrowing involves the government borrowing from the central bank, not the public.

* **Pair 5:** The bank rate is not the rate at which the RBI provides overnight liquidity; that is the repo rate.  The bank rate is a less frequently used policy instrument.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy                    RBI Action
1. Expansionary Monetary Policy     :   Increase the Marginal Standing Facility Rate
2. Combating High Inflation          :   Buy government securities
3. Addressing Rapid Rupee Depreciation:   Sell dollars in the market

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

An expansionary monetary policy aims to increase the money supply to stimulate economic activity.  Increasing the Marginal Standing Facility Rate (MSF Rate) is a *contractionary*, not expansionary, measure as it increases borrowing costs for banks, thus reducing the money supply. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

When inflation is high, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) typically employs contractionary monetary policies to reduce the money supply and curb inflationary pressures. Buying government securities *increases* the money supply, which is counterintuitive to controlling inflation.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

A rapidly depreciating rupee indicates a weakening of the domestic currency against foreign currencies. To counteract this, the RBI often intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling dollars from its reserves. This increases the supply of dollars, strengthening the rupee. Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument             Characteristic
1. Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)   :   Interest and capital gains are tax-exempt
2. Convertible Bonds                 :   Pay a higher interest rate than non-convertible bonds
3. External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) :   Devaluation of domestic currency increases currency risk

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) are designed to protect investors from inflation by adjusting their principal and/or interest payments based on inflation rates. While they might offer tax advantages in some jurisdictions, it's not a universal characteristic.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

Convertible bonds offer the bondholder the option to convert the bond into equity shares of the issuing company. This feature typically results in a *lower* interest rate compared to non-convertible bonds because of the added value of the conversion option. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) are loans taken by domestic entities from foreign lenders. A devaluation of the domestic currency makes it more expensive for the borrower to repay the loan in foreign currency, increasing the currency risk. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Monetary Policy Tool            Effect on Money Supply
1. Cut in Repo Rate                 :   Decreases money supply
2. Increase in CRR                  :   Increases money supply
3. Cut in Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR):   Increases money supply

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks. A cut in the repo rate makes borrowing cheaper for banks, leading to an *increase* in the money supply as banks lend more freely.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The cash reserve ratio (CRR) is the percentage of a bank's deposits that it must keep with the central bank. An increase in the CRR *reduces* the amount of money banks can lend, thus decreasing the money supply. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

The statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) is the percentage of a bank's deposits that it must maintain in the form of specified liquid assets. A cut in the SLR increases the amount of money banks can lend, thus *increasing* the money supply. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme               Primary Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana     :   Providing loans to poor farmers
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme      :   Promote FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
3. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY):   Reduce India’s dependence on gold imports

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) aims to provide funding to micro and small enterprises, not specifically to poor farmers. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme is primarily designed to bring idle gold held by households into the economy and reduce India's reliance on gold imports, not to promote foreign direct investment (FDI) in the gold and jewellery sector. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is a crop insurance scheme that aims to provide insurance coverage to farmers against crop losses due to various perils, not related to gold imports. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.  All three pairs are mismatched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Institution                   Regulatory Body
1. Urban Cooperative Banks              :   Local boards set up by State Governments
2. Public Sector Banks                   :   Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
3. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)           :   Ministry of Finance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Urban Cooperative Banks are primarily regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not by local boards set up by State Governments, although State Governments may have some oversight. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

Public Sector Banks in India are primarily regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.

Small Finance Banks (SFBs) are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not the Ministry of Finance, although the Ministry of Finance plays a role in their overall policy framework. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bond                     Characteristic
1. Zero-Coupon Bonds                :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds
2. Masala Bonds                      :   Issued outside India, denominated in USD
3. Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs) :   Offer lower interest rates due to equity conversion option

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; instead, they are sold at a discount and mature at their face value. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

Masala bonds are rupee-denominated bonds issued in overseas markets, not in USD. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs) offer bondholders the option to convert their bonds into the issuer's equity shares. This conversion option typically results in a lower interest rate compared to non-convertible bonds. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator               Description
1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   Reflects improvement in trade competitiveness
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     :   Indicates appreciation or depreciation of the rupee against a basket of currencies
3. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates:   Calculated by comparing prices of a basket of goods in different countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies, without considering inflation. It does not directly reflect trade competitiveness. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) adjusts the NEER for inflation differences between countries, providing a more accurate picture of a currency's competitiveness. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries, providing a measure of relative purchasing power. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**8.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                     Meaning
1.  Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)           :   Incentive given by a bank to a merchant for accepting debit card payments
2.  Legal Tender Money                       :   Metallic money in circulation
3.  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)           :   Amount banks maintain to offset losses from non-repayment by individual account holders

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a fee charged to merchants by banks for accepting card payments, not an incentive. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

Legal tender money is the currency that a creditor is legally obligated to accept for settling debts, not limited to metallic money. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is the percentage of a bank's risk-weighted credit exposures that must be covered by capital, designed to protect the bank from losses across its portfolio, not just from individual account holders' non-repayment. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.  All pairs are mismatched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Action                          Impact on Indian Rupee
1. Curbing imports of non-essential goods :   Depreciates the Indian Rupee
2. Following an expansionary monetary policy:   Appreciates the Indian Rupee
3. Encouraging Indian borrowers to issue rupee-denominated Masala Bonds:   Appreciates the Indian Rupee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Curbing imports reduces the demand for foreign currency, potentially strengthening the rupee. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

An expansionary monetary policy increases the money supply, potentially leading to inflation and weakening the rupee. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

Encouraging Masala bonds increases the inflow of foreign capital, increasing demand for rupees and potentially strengthening the rupee. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Crisis Mitigation Strategy     Rationale
1.  Maintaining full capital account convertibility:   Reduces vulnerability to short-term capital flight
2.  Not depending on short-term foreign borrowings:   Increases resilience to global shocks
3.  Opening up to more foreign banks          :   Increases competition and efficiency in the banking sector

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Full capital account convertibility exposes a country to rapid capital flight during global financial crises.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

Relying less on short-term foreign borrowing reduces vulnerability to sudden changes in global credit markets and interest rates, and increases resilience to external shocks. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.

Opening up to more foreign banks can enhance competition and efficiency, but it might not necessarily provide immunity to global financial crises. Therefore, pair 3 is not directly linked to crisis immunity. Only pair 2 is correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Security           Description
1. Treasury Bills                 :   Issued by State Governments
2. Dated Securities               :   Traded on BSE/NSE
3. State Development Loans       :   Not available for retail investors through RBI's Retail Direct Scheme
4. Sovereign Gold Bonds         :   Purchased through competitive bidding by retail investors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Dated securities and Treasury bills are indeed traded on exchanges like BSE/NSE.  Statement 1 is incorrect because Treasury bills are issued by the Central Government, not State Governments. Statement 3 is incorrect as State Development Loans are available for retail investors through the RBI's Retail Direct Gilt (RDG) Account.  Statement 4 is incorrect because retail investors cannot participate in the competitive bidding process for government securities. They can purchase through the Retail Direct Scheme but not via competitive bidding.  The question tests factual knowledge about Indian government securities and their accessibility to retail investors.  The incorrect options include plausible distractors based on partial truths or common misconceptions related to government securities trading and investment schemes.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    RBI Scheme/Initiative        Feature
1. Retail Direct Gilt (RDG) Account :   Allows competitive bidding for government securities
2. Global Bond Index Inclusion  :   Eliminates SEBI approval for foreign investment in government securities
3. 'Fully Accessible Route'       :   Imposes a cap on non-resident investment in government securities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  The inclusion of Indian government securities in the Global Bond Index did indeed lead to the removal of the requirement for prior SEBI approval for foreign investors. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Retail Direct Gilt (RDG) Account does *not* allow for competitive bidding by retail investors. Statement 3 is incorrect; the 'Fully Accessible Route' specifically removed the cap on non-resident investment in government securities. The question tests knowledge of specific RBI initiatives and their impact on foreign investment and market access.  The incorrect options present plausible distractors by mixing up features of different schemes or presenting the opposite of the actual outcome.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Market Instrument     Characteristic
1. Masala Bonds                     :   Borrower bears the currency risk
2.  Corporate Bonds                 :   9% FPI ceiling limit as of 2021
3.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) :   Interest and capital gains are tax-exempt


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is partially correct. While the FPI ceiling limit on corporate bonds was indeed 9% at some point, it has since been raised.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Masala bonds shift the currency risk to the *investor*, not the borrower. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the taxability of interest and capital gains on IIBs varies and is not universally tax-exempt. The question evaluates understanding of different debt instruments and their key features, including the nuances of risk allocation and tax implications. The distractors cleverly utilize outdated information or slightly altered characteristics to mislead the candidate.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Exchange Rate System     Characteristic
1. Fixed and Adjustable Exchange Rate: Rupee's value was $1 = Rs. 1 in 1947
2. Managed Float                     :   Central bank never intervenes in the foreign exchange market
3. Free Float                          :   Rupee's value is determined by market forces


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The Indian rupee did indeed have a fixed and adjustable exchange rate system initially, with $1 = Rs. 1 in 1947.  A free float system is characterized by exchange rates determined by market forces. Statement 2 is incorrect; a managed float system involves *some* central bank intervention to manage volatility, not complete abstention from the market. The question tests understanding of different exchange rate systems and their implications for currency valuation.  The distractors play on the common confusion between managed and free float systems, introducing a plausible but incorrect characteristic for the managed float system.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Institution Category    Example
1. Scheduled Commercial Banks      :   Coastal Local Area Bank
2. Non-Scheduled Banks            :   State Bank of India
3. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)   :   Owned 50% by the Central Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. RRBs are indeed owned 50% by the Central Government. Statement 1 is incorrect; Coastal Local Area Bank is a *non-scheduled* bank. Statement 2 is incorrect; the State Bank of India is a *scheduled* commercial bank.  The question assesses knowledge of the categorization and ownership structure of various financial institutions in India.  The distractors utilize institutions that are closely related to the correct category but do not fall under it, creating plausible but incorrect matches.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    RBI Monetary Policy Tool       Effect
1. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)       :   Directly impacts the lending rate
2. Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) :   Influences the amount of money banks can create
3. Open Market Operations (OMO)  :  Primarily used for daily liquidity management


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The SLR directly affects the amount of money banks can lend out by setting a minimum requirement for liquid assets. Statement 1 is incorrect; while CRR influences lending rates indirectly, its primary impact is on the banks’ reserve holdings with the RBI. Statement 3 is also incorrect; OMOs are used for managing liquidity, but LAF (Liquidity Adjustment Facility) is the primary tool for daily liquidity management. This question tests knowledge of specific RBI monetary policy tools and their mechanisms.  The distractors are designed to confuse candidates by mixing up the primary effects of different tools or by presenting a tool's secondary effect as its primary function.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Inflation             Cause
1. Demand-Pull Inflation       :   Increase in the cost of inputs
2. Cost-Push Inflation         :   Excessive demand relative to supply
3. Disinflation                 :   Slowing down of the rate of inflation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Disinflation is indeed a slowing down of the rate of inflation. Statement 1 is incorrect; demand-pull inflation is caused by excessive demand, not increased input costs. Statement 2 is also incorrect; cost-push inflation arises from increased input costs, not excessive demand. The question assesses understanding of different types of inflation and their underlying causes.  The distractors cleverly reverse the causes and effects of demand-pull and cost-push inflation to create confusion.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                         Description
1. Liquidity Trap                   :   Central bank can easily stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates
2.  External Commercial Borrowing (ECB):  Always denominated in foreign currency
3.  Currency Swap                    :   Eliminates exchange rate risk for both parties


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are partially correct. ECBs are commonly in foreign currency, although rupee-denominated ECBs, like Masala Bonds, exist. Currency swaps can mitigate exchange rate risk for both parties if structured appropriately.  Statement 1 is incorrect; a liquidity trap is a situation where monetary policy becomes ineffective because interest rates are already near zero. The question tests understanding of economic concepts and financial instruments, including their limitations and potential risks. The distractors introduce conditions under which the statements might seem true but are not always true in practice.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Instrument              Feature
1. American Depository Receipts (ADRs): Represents ownership in a foreign company
2.  Masala Bonds                     :  Investors bear the currency risk
3.  Forex Swap                       :   Involves exchange of principal amounts in different currencies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Masala bonds do shift the currency risk to the investor. A forex swap involves exchanging principal amounts in different currencies at the beginning and end of the agreement. Statement 1 is incorrect; ADRs represent ownership in an *Indian* company traded on a US exchange, not necessarily a foreign company.  This question tests knowledge of specific financial instruments and their key characteristics. The distractors involve subtle but important differences in the definitions of the instruments, leading to plausible but incorrect matches.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Balance of Payments Component     Description
1. Current Account                 :   Records only trade in goods
2. Capital Account                   :   Includes official reserve transactions
3. Trade Balance                    :   Balance of exports and imports of goods


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The trade balance accurately reflects the difference between the value of a country's exports and imports of goods. Statement 1 is incorrect; the current account encompasses trade in both goods and services, as well as transfer payments. Statement 2 is also incorrect; official reserve transactions are considered part of the overall balance of payments, not specifically the capital account.  The question tests the understanding of balance of payments components and their definitions.  The distractors are designed to confuse candidates by misrepresenting the scope of each component.



**1. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                        Description
1.  Merchant Discount Rate             :   Incentive given by a bank to a merchant for accepting debit card payments.
2.  Legal Tender Money                 :   Metallic money in circulation in a country.
3.  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)      :   Amount decided by each individual bank to offset losses from unpaid dues.
4.  Money Multiplier                   :   Increases with an increase in the population of the country.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correctly matched.  The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) refers to the charge levied on merchants by banks for accepting payments through debit cards. While banks might offer incentives *in addition* to the MDR, the core definition centers around the fee.  Statement 2 is incorrect; legal tender money is defined as money that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of debts. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the CAR is a regulatory requirement set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not decided individually by each bank.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the money multiplier is primarily influenced by factors like the cash reserve ratio (CRR), statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), and the banking habit of the population, not the overall population size.  Therefore, only the first pair is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly link definitions to economic terms.


**2. With reference to Government schemes, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme Name                           Primary Objective
1.  Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana       :   Providing pension to old and destitute persons.
2.  Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme        :   Promoting FDI in the gold and jewellery sector.
3.  Kisan Credit Card Scheme           :   Construction of family houses and setting up village cold storage facilities.
4.  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana :   Social protection and social inclusion.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual recall regarding the objectives of various government schemes. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.  The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme primarily seeks to bring idle gold lying with Indian households into the economy and reduce dependence on gold imports. The Kisan Credit Card scheme provides short-term credit support to farmers for working capital, post-harvest expenses, and consumption requirements, not for constructing houses or cold storage.  The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana focuses on rural infrastructure development, contributing to social inclusion.  Therefore, none of the given pairs are correctly matched as described.  The correct answer would be (d) if the descriptions were aligned with the correct objectives of the schemes.


**3. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Function/Role                     Description
1.  Debt Manager                        :   Manages and services only Government of India Securities.
2.  Banker to Banks                     :   Acts as a lender of last resort for insolvent banks.
3.  Regulation of Banks                 :   Has curtailed powers regarding Public Sector Banks (PSBs).
4.  Management of Foreign Exchange Reserves: Invests reserves primarily in gold.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RBI manages the public debt of both the Central and State Governments, refuting statement 1.  The RBI acts as a lender of last resort for banks that are solvent but facing temporary liquidity issues, making statement 2 correct.  The RBI's regulatory powers are indeed curtailed regarding PSBs, where it lacks the authority to remove directors or force mergers, confirming statement 3.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while gold is a component, the RBI invests foreign exchange reserves in a diversified portfolio of assets including deposits with central banks, foreign commercial banks, and debt instruments. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to monetary policy in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Monetary Policy Instrument           Description/Function
1.  Repo Rate                           :   Absorbs liquidity from banks overnight.
2.  Reverse Repo Rate                   :   Provides overnight liquidity to banks against collateral.
3.  Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)    :   Allows banks to borrow additional overnight money by dipping into CRR.
4.  Standing Deposit Facility (SDF)      :  Available only on weekdays.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The repo rate is the rate at which the RBI lends to banks, while the reverse repo rate is the rate at which the RBI borrows from banks, making statement 1 incorrect and statement 2 correct.  The MSF allows banks to borrow additional overnight money by dipping into their SLR portfolio, not CRR, making statement 3 correct. The SDF is available on all days of the week, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to India's tax system, consider the following pairs:**

   Tax Type                                     Characteristic
1.  Progressive Tax                           :   Tax percentage decreases with increased income.
2.  Specific Tax                             :   Levied as a percentage of the item's value.
3.  Direct Tax                               :   Paid directly by an individual or organization to the government.
4.  Corporate Income Tax (CIT)               :  Has only one tax structure.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A progressive tax system increases the tax rate as income increases, making statement 1 incorrect. A specific tax is levied per unit of a good or service, not as a percentage of value, making statement 2 incorrect. A direct tax is paid directly to the government, making statement 3 correct.  The CIT has two tax structures (with and without exemptions), making statement 4 incorrect.  Only statement 3 is correctly matched.


**6.  With reference to inclusive growth in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                    Characteristic
1. Inclusive Growth                          : Primarily focuses on income redistribution.
2.  Amrit Kaal                               :  A 25-year plan focusing on developed India.
3.  Plug and Play                              : Central government command and control over production.
4.  Command and Control                       :  Ease of doing business through policy support.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Inclusive growth prioritizes broad-based benefits and equal opportunities, not solely income redistribution, making statement 1 incorrect.  Amrit Kaal is indeed a 25-year plan aiming for a developed India, making statement 2 correct.  Plug and Play refers to reducing bureaucratic hurdles for businesses, while command and control is the opposite, making statements 3 and 4 incorrect.  Only statement 2 is correctly matched.


**7. With reference to macroeconomic indicators, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                  Description
1.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) : Improvement indicates better trade competitiveness.
2.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     : Increase indicates rupee appreciation.
3.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)           : Calculated by comparing prices of a basket of goods across countries.
4. Consumer Price Index (CPI)             : Does not capture changes in service prices.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

An increase in NEER reflects rupee appreciation, not improved trade competitiveness, making statement 1 incorrect. An increase in REER suggests a decline in trade competitiveness, not an improvement, making statement 2 incorrect. PPP is indeed calculated by comparing prices of a basket of goods across countries, making statement 3 correct. CPI does capture changes in service prices, making statement 4 incorrect. Only statement 3 is correctly matched.


**8. With reference to  the Indian Banking System, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                                     Function/Characteristic
1.  Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC): Provides insurance cover exceeding ₹5 lakhs per depositor per bank.
2.  Banks Board Bureau (BBB)                : Replaced by the Financial Services Institutions Bureau (FSIB) from July 1st, 2022.
3.  Narasimhan Committee I                   : Recommended maintaining the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) at 38.5%.
4.  P.J. Nayak Committee                     : Recommended the establishment of a Bank Investment Company (BIC).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

DICGC provides insurance cover up to ₹5 lakhs, not exceeding it, making statement 1 incorrect.  The BBB was indeed replaced by the FSIB from July 1st, 2022, making statement 2 correct.  The Narasimhan Committee I recommended lowering the SLR, not maintaining it at 38.5%, making statement 3 incorrect. The P.J. Nayak Committee did recommend establishing a BIC, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to Government budgeting, consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                     Description
1.  Fiscal Stimulus                          :  Intensive government action to boost economic activity.
2.  Consolidated Fund of India              :  Receives all revenues from taxes and receipts for government business.
3.  Capital Budget                           : Includes loans received from foreign governments.
4.  Deficit Financing                         :  Always involves asking the RBI to print more money.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Fiscal stimulus is indeed an intensive government action to boost economic activity, making statement 1 correct. The Consolidated Fund of India does receive all revenues from taxes and other receipts for government business, making statement 2 correct.  The capital budget does include expenditure on acquiring assets and loans and advances granted to states, but not loans received from foreign governments (which would be recorded differently), making statement 3 incorrect. Deficit financing can involve various sources of funding, not just printing money by the RBI, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to  the Indian Economy, consider the following pairs:**

     Economic Term                            Characteristic
1.  V-shaped Recovery                       :  A rapid and sustained recovery after a sharp decline.
2.  Economic Capital Framework (ECF)      :  Determines the allocation of funds to RBI's capital reserves.
3.  Seigniorage                               :  Profit from money creation, including interest income on reserves.
4.  Cryptocurrencies                         :  Are legal tender issued by a central bank.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A V-shaped recovery is indeed a rapid and sustained recovery after a sharp decline, making statement 1 correct. The ECF does determine the allocation of funds to RBI's capital reserves, making statement 2 correct. Seigniorage does include profit from money creation, including interest income on reserves, making statement 3 correct. Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender issued by a central bank, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Function                                     Description
1.  Debt Manager                               :   Manages debt for Central and State Governments
2.  Foreign Currency Investments                :   Invests in US government bonds
3.  Lending to Banks                           :   Provides loans at the repo rate
4.  Seigniorage                                 :   Profit from currency issuance and bank balances
5.  Contingency Risk Buffer                    :  Maintained at 5.5% to 6.5% of balance sheet as per Bimal Jalan Committee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched based on the provided text.  The RBI performs multiple functions related to debt management, including acting as a debt manager for central and state governments, earning interest on its holdings of government securities, and receiving commissions or income for this service. The RBI also engages in foreign currency investments, such as investing in US government bonds, and earns interest on these holdings.  A core function is lending to banks at the repo rate to manage liquidity in the banking system.  Seigniorage, the profit from money creation, is a significant source of revenue for the RBI, derived from interest income on reserves and the inflation tax. Finally, the Bimal Jalan Committee recommended a contingency risk buffer of 5.5% to 6.5% of the RBI's balance sheet.  Therefore, all aspects of the pairs accurately reflect the RBI's multifaceted role in the Indian economy.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                          Definition
1.  Broad Money                               :   Narrow money plus time deposits in banks and post offices
2.  Capital (Factor of Production)             :   Produced factor of production not entirely consumed in production
3.  Capital Gain/Loss                           :   Change in bond value due to price appreciation/reduction
4.  Capitalist Firm                             :   Firm with private ownership, market production, wage labor, and capital accumulation
5.  Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)                   :   Fraction of deposits banks must keep with the RBI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the definitions provided in the text.  Broad money encompasses narrow money and time deposits held by commercial banks and post office savings organizations. Capital, as a factor of production, is defined as something produced and not entirely consumed in the production process. Capital gains or losses represent changes in the value of a bondholder's wealth due to price fluctuations in the bond market. A capitalist firm is characterized by private ownership of means of production, production for the market, the purchase and sale of labor (wages), and continuous capital accumulation. Finally, the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) is the fraction of deposits that commercial banks are mandated to maintain with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect because they do not include all the correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                             Description
1.  Circular Flow of Income                    :   Aggregate value of goods and services circulating as factor payments, expenditure, or production value
2.  Consumer Durables                         :   Consumption goods lasting over a period of time
3.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)                :   Percentage change in weighted average price of a consumption goods basket
4.  Currency Deposit Ratio                     :   Ratio of currency held by the public to deposits in commercial banks
5.  Deficit Financing (Central Bank Borrowing):   Government borrowing from the central bank to finance deficits, potentially leading to inflation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each of the five pairs presents a correct definition based on the provided text. The circular flow of income describes the movement of money and goods within an economy. Consumer durables are goods that are not immediately consumed but provide utility over a longer duration. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation by tracking changes in the weighted average price of a specific basket of consumer goods. The currency deposit ratio expresses the proportion of money held as cash versus deposits in banks.  Finally, deficit financing through central bank borrowing explains the method where governments fund budget shortfalls by borrowing from the central bank, a practice that can inflate the money supply and potentially lead to inflation.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                                 Definition/Characteristic
1.  Exports                                     :   Sale of goods and services to the rest of the world
2.  Externalities                               :   Benefits or harms affecting others due to an economic activity
3.  Fiat Money                                   :   Money with no intrinsic value
4.  Final Goods                                 :   Goods not undergoing further transformation in production
5.  Fiscal Policy                               :   Government policy regarding spending, transfers, and tax structure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs offer accurate definitions or descriptions as per the given text. Exports are the sale of domestically produced goods and services to foreign entities. Externalities represent the unintended consequences of economic activities that impact third parties. Fiat money is currency without inherent value, relying on government decree for its acceptance.  Final goods are those that have completed the production process and are ready for sale to consumers. Finally, fiscal policy encompasses government actions related to taxation, spending, and transfer payments to influence the economy. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and hence incorrect.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                               Description/Characteristic
1.  Fixed Exchange Rate                         :   Exchange rate fixed at a level, adjusted infrequently
2.  Foreign Exchange Reserves                  :   Foreign assets held by a country's central bank
3.  Government Expenditure Multiplier         :   Shows the increase in output from a unit increase in government spending
4.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)               :   Aggregate value of goods and services produced within a country's borders
5.  Gross National Product (GNP)               :   GDP plus net factor income from abroad


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched according to the provided text. A fixed exchange rate is one that is officially set and only adjusted periodically.  Foreign exchange reserves are the foreign currency assets held by a nation's central bank. The government expenditure multiplier quantifies the impact of government spending on overall economic output. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) represents the total value of goods and services produced within a country's geographical boundaries. Finally, Gross National Product (GNP) includes GDP and the net income earned by a country's residents from abroad.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Concept                           Description
1.  High-Powered Money                       :   Money injected by the monetary authority, mainly currency
2.  Imports                                    :   Purchase of goods and services from the rest of the world
3.  Intermediate Goods                         :   Goods used in the production of other goods
4.  Legal Tender                               :   Money issued by the monetary authority, legally acceptable for payments
5.  Liquidity Trap                              :   Very low interest rates where agents expect future rate rises, leading to infinite speculative demand for money


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately define the economic concepts. High-powered money is the base money supplied by the monetary authority of a country. Imports represent the purchase of goods and services from foreign countries. Intermediate goods are used in the production process to create final goods. Legal tender refers to money that is officially recognized and must be accepted for transactions. A liquidity trap describes a situation of extremely low interest rates where individuals prefer to hold cash due to expectations of future interest rate increases, resulting in an infinite demand for money for speculative purposes. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Term                             Definition
1.  Marginal Propensity to Consume           :   Ratio of additional consumption to additional income
2.  Money Multiplier                           :   Ratio of total money supply to high-powered money
3.  Narrow Money                              :   Currency notes, coins, and demand deposits held by the public
4.  Net National Product (NNP)               :   GNP minus depreciation
5.  Open Market Operations                    :   Central bank buying or selling securities to influence money supply


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs correctly define the economic terms. The marginal propensity to consume measures the change in consumption resulting from a change in income. The money multiplier shows the relationship between the monetary base and the total money supply. Narrow money comprises currency and demand deposits held by the public. Net National Product (NNP) is calculated by subtracting depreciation from Gross National Product (GNP). Open market operations are a tool used by central banks to influence money supply through the buying and selling of government securities.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Committee                                   Focus/Recommendation
1.  M. Narasimhan Committee I                 :   Reduced SLR to 25%
2.  M. Narasimhan Committee II                :   Recommended mergers of large Indian banks
3.  Nachiket Mor Committee                    :   Proposed a bank account for every Indian resident above 18
4.  P.J. Nayak Committee                      :   Recommended a Bank Investment Company (BIC)
5.  Financial Services Institutions Bureau (FSIB):   Replaced the Banks Board Bureau (BBB)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the committees and their key focuses or recommendations. The first Narasimhan Committee focused on financial sector reforms, including lowering the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). The second Narasimhan Committee addressed banking sector reforms, proposing mergers of large banks to enhance strength and competitiveness. The Nachiket Mor Committee aimed to expand financial inclusion by recommending a bank account for every adult Indian. The P.J. Nayak Committee addressed governance issues in public sector banks, suggesting the creation of a Bank Investment Company (BIC).  Finally, the FSIB succeeded the Banks Board Bureau (BBB) in overseeing the governance of public sector banks and financial institutions.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incomplete and incorrect.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Concept                          Characteristic/Function
1.  Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs):   Asset size exceeding 2% of GDP
2.  Domestically Systemically Important NBFCs (DSIB-NBFCs):   Asset size exceeding ₹500 crore
3.  Domestically Systemically Important Insurers (D-SII):   Based on assets under management and premium underwritten
4.  Global Depository Receipt (GDR)/American Depository Receipt (ADR):   Shares of companies based outside the US purchased by US investors
5.  Overseas Direct Investment (ODI)           :   Investment by Indian companies abroad


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately describe the institutions or concepts. Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) are identified based on their asset size relative to the GDP.  Similarly, Domestically Systemically Important NBFCs (DSIB-NBFCs) have a defined asset size threshold. Domestically Systemically Important Insurers (D-SII) are classified based on their assets under management and premium income. Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) and American Depository Receipts (ADRs) are mechanisms for foreign investors to purchase shares of companies located in other countries. Overseas Direct Investment (ODI) refers to investments made by domestic companies in foreign markets.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.



**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Expenditure                          Example
1.  Capital Expenditure                         :   Acquiring new technology
2.  Revenue Expenditure                         :   Debt financing
3.  Capital Budget Item                         :   Loans received from foreign governments
4.  Revenue Budget Item                         :   Expenditure on acquisition of assets
5.  Consolidated Fund of India Source           :  All tax revenues received by the Union Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Acquiring new technology is indeed a capital expenditure as it represents investment in an asset that will provide benefits over time.  Loans received from foreign governments are a source of funds for the government and are classified as capital receipts in the capital budget. All tax revenues received by the Union Government are indeed credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.  Pairs 2 and 4 are incorrect. Debt financing is a method of financing, not an expenditure category itself.  Expenditure on the acquisition of assets is a capital expenditure, not a revenue expenditure.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Indicator                         Impact/Significance
1.  Increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER):   Indicates appreciation of the rupee
2.  Increase in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER):   Indicates improvement in trade competitiveness
3.  Increasing divergence between NEER and REER:    Caused by increasing domestic inflation relative to other countries
4.  High Capital-Output Ratio                    :   May lead to low output despite high savings
5.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates      :    Calculated by comparing prices of same basket of goods across countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. An increase in NEER reflects an appreciation of the domestic currency.  An increase in REER suggests improved trade competitiveness. A widening gap between NEER and REER often signals rising domestic inflation compared to other nations. A high capital-output ratio indicates that a large amount of capital investment is needed to generate a small increase in output. Finally, PPP exchange rates are determined by comparing the prices of identical goods and services in different countries. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Policy/Measure                     Outcome/Effect
1.  Fiscal Stimulus                             :   Intense government action to boost economic activity
2.  Value Added Tax (VAT)                       :   Multi-point destination-based tax on value addition
3.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)            :   Brings capital and targets specific sectors
4.  Foreign Institutional Investment (FII)       :   Increases capital availability in general
5.  Goods and Services Tax (GST)               :    Replaces multiple taxes, creating a single market


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. A fiscal stimulus involves government intervention to stimulate economic activity. VAT is a multi-stage consumption tax. FDI brings capital and focuses on specific sectors. FII increases overall capital availability.  GST replaced multiple indirect taxes, leading to a unified national market.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.  


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Program                              Objective/Focus
1. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana         :   Rural road connectivity
2. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) :   Social protection and inclusion
3.  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana        :   Central Sector Scheme (CSS)
4.  Namami Gange                              :   Central Sector Scheme (CSS)
5.  Sagarmala                                  :    Central Sector Scheme (CSS)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) aims to improve rural road infrastructure. MGNREGA is a flagship program focusing on social protection and inclusion through employment guarantee.  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Namami Gange, and Sagarmala are all examples of Central Sector Schemes (CSS), which are fully funded by the central government and implemented by central agencies.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                     Salient Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) :  Covers post-harvest losses due to cyclones and unseasonal rains
2. Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) : Provides 3% interest subvention (4% for aspirational districts)
3.  Kisan Credit Card Scheme                 :  Provides short-term credit for consumption requirements of farm households
4.  Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana            :   Aims at bringing small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system
5.  e-RUPI                                   :   Is a digital voucher, not a digital currency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched based on the provided text. Let's examine each one:

1. **PMFBY:** The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana explicitly covers post-harvest losses from cyclones and unseasonal rains, a significant expansion of crop insurance coverage.

2. **AHIDF:** The Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund offers interest subvention, with a higher rate for beneficiaries in aspirational districts, to incentivize investment in animal husbandry infrastructure.

3. **Kisan Credit Card Scheme:**  The Kisan Credit Card Scheme provides short-term credit, and the text explicitly mentions its use for consumption requirements of farm households among other purposes.

4. **Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana:** The scheme's primary goal is to integrate small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing access to credit.

5. **e-RUPI:** The description clearly states that e-RUPI is a digital voucher, not a digital currency, emphasizing its distinct nature as a targeted benefit delivery mechanism.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  Option (d) is the only one that includes all five correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution                         Characteristic
1. Scheduled Commercial Banks              :   Required to maintain reserve requirements with RBI
2. Non-Scheduled Commercial Banks          :    Not allowed to deal in Foreign Exchange
3. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)        :   Regulated solely by local boards set up by State Governments
4. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)             :   Owned equally by the Central government, concerned State government, and the sponsor bank
5.  Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) :  Regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Let's analyze each:

1. **Scheduled Commercial Banks:** The text explicitly states that scheduled banks must maintain reserve requirements with the RBI, a key feature differentiating them from non-scheduled banks.

2. **Non-Scheduled Commercial Banks:**  The passage accurately notes that non-scheduled banks have restricted operations, including a prohibition on foreign exchange dealings.

3. **Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):** Incorrect. While UCBs are registered under State Cooperative Societies Acts, they are also subject to RBI regulation concerning banking functions.  The statement that they are *solely* supervised by State Governments is inaccurate.

4. **Regional Rural Banks (RRBs):** Incorrect. RRBs are owned in a proportion of 50:15:35 by the Central government, State government, and sponsor bank respectively, not equally.

5. **Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS):** Incorrect. The text clearly states that PACS are *outside* the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and are therefore not regulated by the RBI.

Therefore, only options 1 and 2 are correct, making (a) the correct answer.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                    Key Recommendation
1. Narasimhan Committee I                      :   Recommended a reduction of SLR to 25%
2. Narasimhan Committee II                     :   Recommended the merger of large Indian banks
3. Nachiket Mor Committee                       :   Proposed that every resident be within 15 minutes of a payment access point
4. P J Nayak Committee                         :   Recommended the establishment of a Banks Board Bureau (BBB)
5. Bimal Jalan Committee                       :   Recommended RBI should maintain 5.5% to 6.5% of the balance sheet as Contingency Risk Buffer

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The provided text details the key recommendations of each committee:

1. **Narasimhan Committee I:**  This committee advocated for a reduction in the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) to improve bank efficiency and profitability.

2. **Narasimhan Committee II:**  A major recommendation was the merger of large Indian banks to create stronger, more internationally competitive institutions.

3. **Nachiket Mor Committee:** This committee's report emphasized enhancing financial inclusion, including the accessibility of payment points within a 15-minute walk for every resident.

4. **P J Nayak Committee:**  This committee proposed the creation of a Banks Board Bureau (BBB) to improve the governance of public sector banks.  While the BBB was later replaced by the FSIB, the initial recommendation is accurately reflected.

5. **Bimal Jalan Committee:** This committee's key recommendation concerned the appropriate level of contingency risk buffer for the RBI, suggesting a range of 5.5% to 6.5% of the balance sheet.


Therefore, option (c) is correct, encompassing all accurately paired committees and their recommendations.  Other options are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. With reference to the Indian Financial System, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bank                                    Governing Act/Regulation
1. Scheduled Commercial Banks                    :   RBI Act, 1934
2. Non-Scheduled Commercial Banks                :   Banking Regulation Act, 1949
3. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)               :   Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002 (for multi-state UCBs)
4. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)                   :   Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976
5. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS)   :   State Cooperative Societies Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. The text provides information on the regulatory frameworks governing various banking institutions in India:

1. **Scheduled Commercial Banks:** These banks' operations are largely governed by the RBI Act, 1934, which establishes the RBI's role in their regulation and supervision.

2. **Non-Scheduled Commercial Banks:**  The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, applies to these banks, although their operations are more limited than scheduled banks.

3. **Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):** Multi-state UCBs fall under the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002, while single-state UCBs are governed by respective state cooperative societies acts.  The question correctly reflects the governance of multi-state UCBs.

4. **Regional Rural Banks (RRBs):** The Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976, specifically governs the establishment, operation, and regulation of RRBs.

5. **Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS):** These societies are primarily regulated at the state level under the respective State Cooperative Societies Acts.

Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the governing acts/regulations for all five types of banks. Other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                      Definition/Description
1.  Fiscal Stimulus                             :   Intense Government action to boost economic activity
2.  Value Added Tax (VAT)                       :   Tax levied on value addition at each stage of a transaction
3.  Capital Gains                               :   Increase in the value of a property owned
4.  Economic Capital                           :   Amount of capital a company needs to ensure solvency
5.  Seigniorage                                  :   Profit made by a government by issuing currency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched according to the provided text.  Let's look at each one:

1. **Fiscal Stimulus:** The definition provided accurately reflects the purpose of a fiscal stimulus—to significantly boost economic activity through government intervention.

2. **Value Added Tax (VAT):**  The description correctly defines VAT as a tax on the value added at each stage of production and distribution.

3. **Capital Gains:** This is a precise definition of capital gains, focusing on the appreciation in the value of an asset.

4. **Economic Capital:** The description accurately defines economic capital as the capital a company needs to maintain solvency, given its risk profile.

5. **Seigniorage:**  This is a correct definition of seigniorage, which refers to the profit a government makes by issuing currency. The difference between the face value of the currency and the cost of production is the seigniorage.


Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, as it includes all five correctly matched pairs. The other options are incorrect because they omit at least one of the correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                      Definition/Description
1.  Broad Money                        :   Narrow money + time deposits held by commercial banks and post office savings organizations
2.  Capital Gain/Loss                 :   Increase or decrease in the value of a bondholder's wealth due to changes in bond prices
3.  Capital Goods                      :   Goods used in producing other goods, not for immediate consumer needs
4.  Capitalist Firm                    :   A firm with private ownership of means of production, producing for the market, purchasing labor, and accumulating capital.
5.  Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)          :   The fraction of deposits commercial banks must keep with the RBI.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Let's examine each one:

1. **Broad Money:** The definition accurately reflects the composition of broad money, encompassing narrow money (currency and demand deposits) and the addition of time deposits held by specific financial institutions.  This is a standard macroeconomic definition.

2. **Capital Gain/Loss:** This definition correctly identifies capital gains and losses as arising from fluctuations in the market value of bonds, a key concept in finance and investment.  The change in value is directly linked to the bond's price movement.

3. **Capital Goods:** This is a classic economic definition. Capital goods are instrumental in the production process, unlike consumer goods which satisfy immediate wants.  Their role is to enhance future production capacity.

4. **Capitalist Firm:** The description accurately encapsulates the defining characteristics of a capitalist firm: private ownership, market-oriented production, wage-based labor, and continuous capital accumulation. This is a fundamental concept in economics.

5. **Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR):**  This definition precisely describes the CRR, a crucial tool used by central banks to manage liquidity and control money supply within the banking system. The ratio dictates the minimum reserves banks must hold.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Monetary Policy Instrument         Effect on Money Supply
1.  Increase in Repo Rate             :   Increases money supply
2.  Open Market Purchase of Securities:   Decreases money supply
3.  Increase in CRR                   :   Decreases money supply
4.  Decrease in SLR                   :   Increases money supply
5.  Decrease in Bank Rate             :   Decreases money supply


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Increase in Repo Rate:** An increase in the repo rate (the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks) makes borrowing more expensive for banks. This reduces their lending capacity, thus *decreasing*, not increasing, the money supply.

2. **Open Market Purchase of Securities:** When the central bank purchases government securities, it injects liquidity into the market, thereby *increasing*, not decreasing, the money supply.

3. **Increase in CRR:** An increase in the CRR (the percentage of deposits banks must keep as reserves) reduces the amount of money banks can lend, therefore *decreasing* the money supply. This is a correct matching.

4. **Decrease in SLR:** A decrease in the SLR (the percentage of deposits banks must maintain as liquid assets) increases the amount of money banks can lend, thus *increasing* the money supply. This is a correct matching.

5. **Decrease in Bank Rate:** A decrease in the bank rate (the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks) makes borrowing cheaper, encouraging banks to lend more, thereby *increasing*, not decreasing, the money supply.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Market Term             Description
1.  Primary Market                  :   Market for trading previously issued securities
2.  Secondary Market               :   Market where new securities are issued
3.  Money Market                    :   Market for short-term (less than one year) financial instruments
4.  Capital Market                  :   Market for medium and long-term securities (more than one year)
5.  Call/Notice Money                :   A long-term debt instrument


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other pairs contain incorrect descriptions:

1. **Primary Market:** The primary market is where new securities are initially issued by corporations or governments, not where previously issued securities are traded.  That's the function of the secondary market.

2. **Secondary Market:**  This is the correct opposite of the first pair.  The secondary market facilitates the trading of existing securities among investors.

3. **Money Market:** This definition accurately describes the money market, which deals in highly liquid, short-term debt instruments.

4. **Capital Market:** This is correctly matched. The capital market handles medium to long-term debt and equity instruments.

5. **Call/Notice Money:** Call/Notice money is a short-term borrowing instrument in the money market, not a long-term debt instrument.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                           Explanation
1.  Deficit Financing                 :   Government repays public debt
2.  Inflation Tax                     :   Loss in value of currency due to inflation, reducing government debt
3.  Seigniorage                       :   Profit from money creation, generating revenue for the government
4.  Monetary Base (High-Powered Money):   Currency held by the public and banks, plus banks' deposits with the central bank.
5.  Money Multiplier                 :   The ratio of total money supply to the high-powered money.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect.

1. **Deficit Financing:** Deficit financing involves the government borrowing to cover budget shortfalls, not repaying public debt. Repaying debt would *reduce* the deficit.

2. **Inflation Tax:** This is correctly matched. Inflation erodes the real value of money, effectively acting as a tax on those holding cash. This can indirectly reduce the real value of government debt.

3. **Seigniorage:** This is correctly matched. Seigniorage is the profit a government earns from issuing currency, a way of generating revenue without direct taxation.

4. **Monetary Base:** This definition correctly outlines the components of the monetary base (also known as high-powered money).  It's the foundation upon which the broader money supply is built.

5. **Money Multiplier:** This is correctly matched. The money multiplier shows how a change in the monetary base can lead to a larger change in the overall money supply.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Function                       Description
1.  Lender of Last Resort            :   Regulates commercial banks’ branch expansion
2.  Monetary Authority               :   Supervises the payments system
3.  Bank Supervision and Regulation  :   Manages the issue of banknotes and reserves
4.  Overseeing the Payments System  :   Provides liquidity support to commercial banks during crises
5.  Regulating Commercial Banks      :   Formulates and implements monetary policy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The other pairs incorrectly link RBI functions with their descriptions:

1. **Lender of Last Resort:** The lender of last resort function involves providing emergency liquidity support to banks facing solvency issues, not regulating branch expansion. Branch expansion is a regulatory function.

2. **Monetary Authority:**  The monetary authority function correctly includes formulating and implementing monetary policy, managing the money supply, and influencing interest rates.

3. **Bank Supervision and Regulation:** This function accurately describes the RBI's role in overseeing the health and stability of the banking system, including capital adequacy, risk management, and compliance.

4. **Overseeing the Payments System:** The RBI plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth functioning of the country's payment systems, including clearing and settlement mechanisms.

5. **Regulating Commercial Banks:** While the RBI regulates commercial banks, the description of formulating monetary policy belongs to the 'Monetary Authority' function.  Regulation is a broader function encompassing many aspects beyond monetary policy.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                 Meaning/Function
1.  Repo Rate                             :   Rate at which commercial banks borrow from RBI for short-term liquidity
2.  Reverse Repo Rate                     :   Rate at which RBI borrows from commercial banks
3.  Bank Rate                             :   Minimum lending rate for commercial banks
4.  MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate): Average cost of funds for banks
5.  Base Rate                            :   Replaced by MCLR as the minimum lending rate

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched.  Let's analyze the incorrect pairs:

1. **Repo Rate:**  This is correctly defined as the rate at which commercial banks borrow funds from the RBI for short-term liquidity needs.

2. **Reverse Repo Rate:** This is accurately described as the rate at which the RBI borrows funds from commercial banks.  This is used to absorb excess liquidity in the banking system.

3. **Bank Rate:** While the bank rate was historically a significant policy rate, it's not the *minimum* lending rate for commercial banks anymore.  That role has been largely superseded by the MCLR and external benchmarks.

4. **MCLR:** The MCLR is based on the *marginal* cost of funds, not the average cost.  The marginal cost represents the cost of acquiring additional funds.

5. **Base Rate:** This is correctly stated; the base rate system was replaced by the MCLR system.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Basel Norm                         Focus/Objective
1.  Basel I                            :   Comprehensive risk management framework addressing operational, credit, and market risks.
2.  Basel II                           :   Focuses primarily on credit risk, defining capital and risk weights.
3.  Basel III                           :   Introduces stricter capital requirements and liquidity standards.
4.  BCBS (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision): Fosters international cooperation among central banks for financial stability and banking regulation.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The descriptions of Basel I and Basel III are inaccurate:

1. **Basel I:** Basel I primarily focused on credit risk, not on a comprehensive framework encompassing operational, credit, and market risks.  Those aspects were introduced later.

2. **Basel II:** This accurately describes the main objective of Basel II.  It formalized capital requirements and risk-weighting approaches, primarily focusing on credit risk.

3. **Basel III:** Basel III introduced more stringent capital requirements and liquidity standards to enhance the resilience of the banking system in the face of financial crises, but it doesn't only focus on that.

4. **BCBS:** This is a correct description.  The BCBS is responsible for setting international standards for banking regulation, promoting cooperation among central banks, and working towards financial stability.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                Characteristic
1.  Treasury Bills                     :   Long-term debt instrument issued by the central bank
2.  Dated Securities                   :   Issued by the central government, traded in capital markets
3.  State Development Loans           :   Short-term debt instrument issued by state governments
4.  Commercial Paper                  :   Unsecured short-term debt instrument issued by corporations
5.  Certificate of Deposit (CD)        :   Secured short-term debt instrument issued by banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The descriptions for Treasury Bills and State Development Loans are incorrect:

1. **Treasury Bills:** Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments, typically issued by governments (central or state), not long-term and not always issued by the central bank.

2. **Dated Securities:** This is correctly matched. Dated securities are long-term debt instruments issued by governments (central or state) and are traded in the capital markets.

3. **State Development Loans:** State development loans are typically long-term debt instruments issued by state governments, not short-term.

4. **Commercial Paper:** This accurately describes commercial paper as an unsecured, short-term promissory note issued by corporations to raise funds.

5. **Certificate of Deposit (CD):** This is accurately described. CDs are short-term debt instruments issued by banks, representing a deposit that can be traded. While they are generally considered low-risk, they are not explicitly secured in the same way a mortgage-backed security might be.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Inflation Type                      Cause/Characteristic
1. Demand-pull inflation              :   Caused by supply-side shocks
2. Cost-push inflation                :   Caused by excess aggregate demand
3.  Stagflation                       :   Simultaneous occurrence of high inflation and high unemployment
4.  Hyperinflation                     :   Extremely rapid and uncontrolled inflation
5.  Deflation                          :   Sustained decrease in the general price level


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly link inflation types with their causes:

1. **Demand-pull inflation:** Demand-pull inflation is caused by excessive aggregate demand exceeding the economy's capacity to produce goods and services, not by supply-side shocks. Supply-side shocks typically lead to cost-push inflation.

2. **Cost-push inflation:** Cost-push inflation arises from increases in production costs (e.g., wages, raw materials), not from excess aggregate demand. Excess aggregate demand causes demand-pull inflation.

3. **Stagflation:** This is a correct description.  Stagflation is a macroeconomic phenomenon characterized by simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment.

4. **Hyperinflation:** This is a correct description. Hyperinflation is a period of extremely rapid and uncontrolled inflation.

5. **Deflation:** This is a correct description. Deflation is a sustained decrease in the general price level.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Scheme/Initiative               Objective/Feature
1.  Retail Direct Gilt (RDG) Account   :   Allows retail investors to participate in competitive bidding for government securities
2.  Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS) :   Used to absorb surplus liquidity from large capital inflows
3.  Open Market Operations (OMO)     :   Primarily used to manage day-to-day liquidity in the money market
4.  Repo Rate                          :   Minimum lending rate for commercial banks
5.  MCLR                               :   Based on the average cost of funds for banks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The other pairs contain inaccuracies:

1. **Retail Direct Gilt (RDG) Account:** The RDG account allows retail investors to directly purchase government securities but does *not* allow participation in competitive bidding.  Competitive bidding is typically reserved for institutional investors.

2. **Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS):** The MSS is correctly described as a tool used by the RBI to manage large capital inflows that could lead to excessive liquidity and inflationary pressures.

3. **Open Market Operations (OMO):** OMOs, while used for liquidity management, are not *primarily* used for day-to-day liquidity management. That is more the role of the repo rate and other short-term instruments. OMOs are used for longer-term adjustments.

4. **Repo Rate:** The repo rate is not the minimum lending rate for commercial banks; that is the role of the MCLR (or previously the base rate). The repo rate is the rate at which the RBI lends to commercial banks.

5. **MCLR:**  The MCLR is based on the *marginal* cost of funds, not the average cost.  The marginal cost represents the cost of acquiring additional funds.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Scheme                     Primary Aim
    1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana      :  Providing pension to old and destitute persons
    2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme       :   To promote FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
    3. Gold Monetization Scheme         :   To reduce India’s dependence on gold imports
    4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme         :   Funding voluntary organizations involved in skill development

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing loans. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme are designed to bring idle gold lying with Indian households into the economy and reduce India's dependence on gold imports. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme offers short-term credit support to farmers for various agricultural purposes, not for funding voluntary organizations. Option (c) correctly identifies only the Gold Monetization Scheme's primary objective.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly match the schemes with their aims, reflecting common misconceptions about government financial initiatives.  A thorough understanding of each scheme's design and objectives is crucial for accurate matching.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Instrument                 Description
    1. Commercial Paper                  : A long-term instrument issued by the RBI to a corporation
    2. Certificate of Deposit             : A short-term unsecured promissory note
    3. Call money                         : A short-term finance used for interbank transactions
    4. Zero coupon Bonds                 : Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations, not the RBI. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term debt instruments issued by banks, not necessarily unsecured. Call money is indeed a short-term finance instrument primarily used for interbank transactions.  Zero-coupon bonds are long-term bonds that do not pay periodic interest but are sold at a discount and mature at face value, not short-term instruments issued by banks to corporations.  Therefore, only the description of call money is correct. The other options contain at least one incorrectly matched pair, highlighting the importance of precise definitions in financial instruments.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    RBI Action                                    Economic Situation
    1. Buying government securities              : Inflation is too high
    2. Selling dollars in the market              : Rupee is rapidly appreciating
    3. Buying dollars                            : Interest rates in the USA or European Union rise

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

If inflation is too high, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would typically *sell* government securities to reduce the money supply, not buy them.  A rapidly depreciating rupee would prompt the RBI to *sell* dollars to support the rupee, not the reverse.  If interest rates in the US or EU rise, it would likely *encourage* capital outflow from India, making the RBI less inclined to buy dollars.  Therefore, only the second and third pairs are correctly matched, reflecting the RBI's typical responses to currency depreciation and changes in global interest rates.  Understanding the RBI's monetary policy tools and their application in different economic scenarios is vital for correct analysis.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                     Definition
    1. Legal tender money                     : Bank money in the form of cheques, drafts, bills of exchange
    2. Deflation                              : A sudden fall in the value of a currency against other currencies
    3. Base effect                            : The impact of the price levels of the previous year on the calculation of the inflation rate
    4. Merchant Discount Rate                : The amount paid back by banks to their customers when they use debit cards

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Legal tender money is the money that a creditor is compelled to accept in settlement of debts, not just bank money. Deflation is a persistent fall in the general price level, not a sudden fall in currency value. The base effect accurately describes the impact of previous year's price levels on current inflation calculations. The merchant discount rate is the charge a bank levies on a merchant for accepting payments via its debit cards, not a payment back to customers.  Only the definition of the base effect is entirely correct.  The other options contain inaccuracies in their definitions, demonstrating the need for precise understanding of economic terminology.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Bank                                  Characteristic
    1. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)                 : Primarily focused on supplying credit to large corporations
    2. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)             : Supervised and regulated by RBI only
    3. Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs):  Not subject to additional regulatory measures

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Small Finance Banks (SFBs) are designed to provide credit to small businesses, small and marginal farmers, and to encourage entrepreneurship, particularly in rural areas, not just large corporations. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are regulated by both the RBI and local boards set up by state governments.  Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) are indeed subject to additional regulatory and supervisory measures due to their size and systemic importance.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, illustrating the importance of understanding the specific roles and regulations governing various types of banks in India.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Investment Type                         Characteristic
    1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)     : Investment through capital instruments in a listed company less than 10% of equity
    2. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)   : Investment involving debt-servicing
    3. Masala Bonds                           : Bonds issued outside India denominated in foreign currency

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

FDI is defined as investment through capital instruments of 10% or more of equity in a listed company or in an unlisted company. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) is not inherently debt-creating, and Masala Bonds are issued outside India but denominated in Indian Rupees, not foreign currency. Hence, none of the provided characteristics accurately describe the given investment types.  This question highlights the need for precise definitions and a nuanced understanding of the differences between FDI and FPI, as well as the specific nature of Masala Bonds.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    RBI Function                             Description
    1. Open Market Operations (OMO)          : Primarily used for daily liquidity management
    2. Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS)     : Designed to absorb short-term liquidity fluctuations
    3. Lender of last resort                  : Providing guarantees of solvency to commercial banks during a liquidity crisis

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While OMOs can be used for daily liquidity management, their primary purpose is to manage the overall money supply and influence interest rates.  MSS is specifically designed to absorb *long-term* liquidity arising from large capital inflows, not short-term fluctuations. The description of the lender of last resort function is accurate. Therefore, only the description of the lender of last resort function is correct. The other options contain inaccuracies regarding the primary functions of OMOs and MSS, highlighting the need for a thorough understanding of RBI's monetary policy tools.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Account Type                             Feature
    1. Current Account                         : Earns interest
    2. Savings Account                         : No limit on number of transactions
    3. Fixed Deposit Account                    : Can't be withdrawn prematurely
    4. Recurring Deposit Account               : Suitable for those with lump-sum savings

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Current accounts generally do not earn interest. Savings accounts have restrictions on the number of transactions and value of transactions. Fixed deposit accounts can be withdrawn prematurely, but with a penalty. Recurring deposit accounts are ideal for those who can save small amounts regularly, not those with lump-sum savings. Therefore, none of the pairs accurately reflect the features of the given account types. This question highlights the need for a clear understanding of the characteristics and functionalities of various bank account types available to customers.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Measure of Money Supply                  Components
    1. M1                                     : Time deposits of the public with banks
    2. M2                                     : Savings deposits with Post Office Savings Bank
    3. M3                                     : Currency with the public
    4. M4                                     : Demand deposits of the public with banks

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

M1 includes currency with the public and demand deposits with banks, not time deposits. M2 includes M1 plus savings deposits with Post Office Savings Banks. M3 includes M1 plus time deposits with banks. M4 includes M3 plus total deposits with Post Office Savings Banks.  Therefore, only the components of M2 and M3 are correctly identified.  The incorrect pairings highlight the nuanced distinctions between the different measures of money supply (M1-M4) and their constituent elements.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Cryptocurrency Related Term               Description
    1. Cryptocurrencies                        : Issued by the Government or RBI
    2. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) : Not a legal tender
    3. Blockchain                             : Underlying technology for cryptocurrency transactions
    4. Mining                                  : Process of generating unlimited numbers of cryptocurrencies

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Cryptocurrencies are not issued by governments or central banks; they are decentralized digital assets.  CBDCs are indeed legal tender issued by central banks. Blockchain technology underpins cryptocurrency transactions.  Mining is the process of generating a limited number of cryptocurrencies, not unlimited.  Therefore, only the description of blockchain is correct.  The other options demonstrate common misconceptions about the technical aspects of cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology.  A strong grasp of these technicalities is crucial for analyzing the cryptocurrency landscape accurately.


**1. With reference to economic indicators in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                 Characteristic
1. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)           :   Gives less weight to food articles compared to CPI (IW)
2. Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI (IW)) :   Published monthly only
3. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) : Indicates rupee appreciation when it increases
4. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)    :   Indicates improved trade competitiveness when it increases

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The WPI in India historically gave less weight to food articles than the CPI (IW), making statement 1 correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the WPI is available on a monthly basis, but the CPI (IW) also has a monthly publication.  Statement 3 is correct; an increase in NEER indicates the domestic currency (rupee in this case) is appreciating against a basket of other currencies. Statement 4 is incorrect.  An increase in REER does *not* necessarily indicate improved trade competitiveness. While a lower REER generally boosts competitiveness, the impact of an increase depends on various factors including domestic inflation and productivity changes relative to trading partners. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to financial instruments and institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Instrument/Institution                     Feature
1.  Commercial Paper                       :   Long-term unsecured promissory note
2.  Certificate of Deposit                   :   Issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to corporations
3.  Call Money                               :   Short-term finance for interbank transactions
4.  Zero Coupon Bonds                       :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; Commercial Paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note, not long-term. Statement 2 is incorrect; Certificates of Deposit are short-term borrowing instruments issued by banks, not the RBI, to corporations.  Statement 3 is correct; call money is indeed a short-term interbank borrowing instrument. Statement 4 is incorrect; Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; the return comes from the difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3.  Consider the following pairs related to the Indian banking system:**

   Entity                                      Characteristic
1.  Scheduled Commercial Banks               :   Required to maintain reserve requirements with the RBI as per the RBI Act, 1934
2.  Non-Scheduled Commercial Banks           :   Allowed to deal in Foreign Exchange
3.  Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)             :   Owned solely by the Central Government
4.  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)           :   Supervised and regulated solely by local boards set up by State Governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; Scheduled Commercial Banks are mandated by the RBI Act, 1934, to maintain reserve requirements with the RBI. Statement 2 is incorrect; Non-Scheduled Commercial Banks have limitations on their operations and are typically not allowed to deal in foreign exchange. Statement 3 is incorrect; RRBs have a three-tier ownership structure involving the Central Government, State Government, and a sponsor bank. Statement 4 is incorrect; UCBs are under dual control of the RBI and the Registrar of Cooperative Societies. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to government schemes and initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                  Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana                     :   Providing loans to poor farmers for cultivating particular crops
2.  Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme                      :   To promote FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
3.  Kisan Credit Card Scheme                        :   Providing short-term credit support to farmers for post-harvest expenses only
4.  e-RUPI                                          :  A digital virtual currency for welfare payments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; MUDRA Yojana aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system, not specifically for farming. Statement 2 is incorrect; Sovereign Gold Bonds aim to bring idle gold into the economy and reduce imports, not to promote FDI. Statement 3 is partially correct; Kisan Credit Cards provide short-term credit for various agricultural purposes, including post-harvest expenses, but not exclusively. Statement 4 is incorrect; e-RUPI is a digital voucher, not a virtual currency.  Therefore, only pair 3 is partially correct, making (b) the closest option.  It's important to note the nuanced inaccuracy in statement 3.


**5. With reference to inflation and monetary policy in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Action                                    Effect
1. Increase in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)           :   Commercial banks have more money to lend
2.  Expansionary monetary policies                   :   Decrease demand-pull inflation
3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) buying government securities :   Likely response to very high inflation
4.  Inflation-indexing wages                         :   Increase demand-pull inflation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; an increase in CRR reduces the money commercial banks have available to lend. Statement 2 is incorrect; expansionary monetary policies tend to *increase*, not decrease, demand-pull inflation. Statement 3 is correct; buying government securities injects liquidity into the market, a measure often taken to counter high inflation. Statement 4 is correct; inflation-indexing wages increases disposable income, fueling demand-pull inflation.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6.  Consider the following pairs related to India's balance of payments:**

  Account                                     Feature
1. Current Account                             : Records only exports and imports of goods
2. Capital Account                              : Records all international purchases and sales of assets
3. Balance of Payments Surplus                : Necessarily implies a current account surplus
4.  Autonomous Transactions                    :  Transactions made independently of the state of the BoP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the current account encompasses goods, services, and transfer payments. Statement 2 is correct; the capital account indeed tracks international asset transactions. Statement 3 is incorrect; a current account deficit can be financed by a capital account surplus, resulting in a BoP surplus or equilibrium.  Statement 4 is correct; autonomous transactions are independent of the BoP status. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to  the Indian economy's openness, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                  Measurement/Indicator
1. Degree of openness of an economy        :   Total foreign trade (exports + imports) as a proportion of GDP
2. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)           :    Ratio of foreign to domestic prices measured in the same currency
3. Bilateral Nominal Exchange Rate         :   Real exchange rate
4. Real Exchange Rate                       :   Amount of domestic currency required to buy one unit of foreign currency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the degree of openness is commonly measured by the ratio of total foreign trade to GDP. Statement 2 is correct; PPP is the ratio of price levels in two countries, expressed in a common currency. Statement 3 is incorrect; the bilateral nominal exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another, not the real exchange rate. Statement 4 is incorrect; the real exchange rate is the ratio of foreign to domestic prices, while the bilateral nominal exchange rate is the price of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.



**8. Consider the following pairs regarding human capital formation in India:**

   Source of Human Capital                    Description
1. Investment in Education                   :  Primarily aimed at increasing future profits for individuals
2. Investment in Health                      : Includes preventive, curative, and social medicine
3. On-the-job Training                       : Always involves sending workers for off-campus training
4. Migration                                 : Driven solely by higher salaries in the destination country


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; while investment in education aims to increase future income, it's not solely focused on profit maximization in the same way as business investment. Statement 2 is correct; investment in health encompasses various approaches. Statement 3 is incorrect; on-the-job training can occur within the firm or through external programs. Statement 4 is incorrect; migration decisions are complex, influenced by factors beyond salary.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are partially correct, making option (c) the most appropriate.


**9. With reference to the impact of economic reforms in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Measure                                     Consequence
1.  Removal of fertiliser subsidy                       : Increased cost of production for small and marginal farmers
2. Reduction in import duties on agricultural products : Enhanced international competitiveness for Indian farmers
3.  Disinvestment of Public Sector Units (PSUs)        :  Always resulted in a substantial loss to the government
4.  Opening up of the economy                          : Rapid increase in foreign direct investment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; removing fertilizer subsidies directly increased costs for farmers. Statement 2 is incorrect; while reduced import duties can increase competitiveness, the impact is complex and depends on other factors, including domestic productivity and global market dynamics.  Statement 3 is incorrect; disinvestment outcomes varied; some sales may have resulted in losses, while others may have yielded profits or fair market value. Statement 4 is correct; the economic reforms led to a significant increase in FDI. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are clearly and directly matched.


**1. With reference to Domestically Systemically Important Institutions (DSIIs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution Category                     Institution Name
    1. Domestically Systemically Important Bank (DSIB) :  Bank of Baroda
    2. Domestically Systemically Important NBFC (DSINBFC) : Bajaj Finance
    3. Domestically Systemically Important Insurer (DSII) :  New India Assurance Company Limited
    4. Domestically Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructure (DSIFMI) :  National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) designates Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) based on asset size exceeding 2% of the GDP. While SBI, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank are currently classified as DSIBs, Bank of Baroda (option 1) may or may not be included depending on the annual review.  Therefore, pair 1 is not necessarily correct.

The RBI also identifies Domestically Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial Companies (DSINBFCs) based on asset size exceeding ₹500 crore. Bajaj Finance (option 2) is a large NBFC, but its inclusion as a DSINBFC would depend on meeting the RBI's criteria. Thus, pair 2 is not definitively correct.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) declares Domestically Systemically Important Insurers (DSIIs) based on assets under management and premiums underwritten. New India Assurance Company Limited (option 3) is correctly paired as it was among the DSIIs declared by IRDAI for 2020-21, along with LIC and GIC.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) designates Domestically Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructures (DSIFMIs). The National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX) (option 4) is accurately paired as an example of a DSIFMI.

Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are definitively correctly matched based on the provided information.  The other pairs represent institutions that *could* be DSIIs, but their inclusion is not guaranteed and depends on various factors.


**2. With reference to Foreign Investment in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Investment Type                      Description
    1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)   : Investment less than 10% of equity capital in a listed company
    2. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) : Investment through capital instruments in an unlisted company
    3. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) : Investment in Central Government securities
    4. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)   :  Investment exceeding 10% of equity capital in a listed Indian company


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is defined as investment in capital instruments by a non-resident, either in an unlisted Indian company or representing 10% or more equity in a listed company. Option 4 accurately reflects this definition.  Option 1 is incorrect because an investment of less than 10% in a listed company is classified as Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI).

Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) includes investments in capital instruments where the investment is less than 10% of the equity capital of a listed Indian company. Option 3 correctly states that FPIs can invest in Central and State Government securities.  Option 2 is incorrect because investment in an unlisted company is considered FDI, not FPI.

Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The other pairs incorrectly classify the type of foreign investment.  Understanding the distinction between FDI and FPI, particularly concerning the 10% equity threshold in listed companies, is crucial for correct matching.


**3. With reference to the regulation of financial institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution Type                       Regulatory Body
    1. Commercial Banks (except PSBs)  : Ministry of Finance
    2. Public Sector Banks (PSBs)        :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Ministry of Finance
    3. Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) only
    4. Cooperative Banks                   : Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and respective State Governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Commercial banks (excluding Public Sector Banks or PSBs) are primarily regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The Ministry of Finance has a role in policy matters but the day-to-day regulation rests with the RBI. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

Public Sector Banks (PSBs) are under dual regulation: the RBI for banking operations and the Ministry of Finance for broader policy and governance.  Pair 2 is correctly matched.

Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are regulated by the RBI, but the statement that they are *only* regulated by the RBI is a simplification. While the RBI is the primary regulator, other bodies like SEBI and IRDAI also have regulatory oversight depending on the specific activities of the NBFC.  Thus, pair 3 is not entirely accurate.

Cooperative banks are under dual regulation, with the RBI overseeing banking functions and the respective State Governments regulating management and administrative aspects. Pair 4 is correctly matched.

Hence, only pairs 2 and 4 are accurately matched. The other pairs either oversimplify or misrepresent the regulatory framework of the respective institutions.


**4. With reference to the functions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

    Function                                  Source of Power
    1.  Managing Government Securities       :  RBI Act, 1934
    2.  Regulating Foreign Exchange Market   :  Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999
    3.  Supervising Payment Banks            :  Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007
    4.  Overseeing the management of foreign exchange reserves: RBI Act, 1934


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RBI's role in managing government securities is explicitly derived from the RBI Act, 1934. Pair 1 is correctly matched.

The RBI's supervision of the foreign exchange market stems from the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999. Pair 2 is correctly matched.

While the RBI licenses and regulates Payment Banks, the specific legal basis isn't solely the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  The RBI's broader powers under the RBI Act, 1934, also underpin this function. Therefore, pair 3 is not entirely accurate.

The RBI's authority to manage foreign exchange reserves is directly granted by the RBI Act, 1934. Pair 4 is correctly matched.

Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 3 is incorrect because it oversimplifies the legal basis for the RBI's regulation of Payment Banks.


**5. With reference to  the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of PM-KISAN                     Details
    1. Beneficiary Eligibility               :  All landholding farmers
    2. Financial Assistance Provided       :  ₹6,000 per year in three installments
    3.  Implementation Agency              :  Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare
    4. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Mechanism:  Through bank accounts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While PM-KISAN aims to provide financial assistance to farmers, the eligibility criteria are more nuanced than simply "all landholding farmers". Small and marginal farmers are prioritized, and specific exclusion criteria exist.  Therefore, pair 1 is not fully accurate.

The scheme provides ₹6,000 per year, disbursed in three equal installments, making pair 2 correct.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is the primary implementing agency for PM-KISAN, making pair 3 correct.

The scheme utilizes Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) through the beneficiaries' bank accounts, making pair 4 correct.

Thus, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is misleading due to the complexities of beneficiary eligibility under the scheme.  The other pairs accurately reflect the scheme's core features.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on polity and governance aspects related to the Indian economy.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator                     Description
1.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :  Reflects the value of the rupee against a basket of currencies, adjusted for inflation.
2.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)    : Indicates the relative price competitiveness of Indian goods and services in international markets.
3. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates: Calculated by comparing prices of a basket of goods and services in different countries, accounting for inflation.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. NEER measures the value of the rupee against other currencies without accounting for inflation. REER adjusts NEER for inflation, providing a more accurate picture of a country's trade competitiveness.  PPP exchange rates compare the cost of a standard basket of goods across countries, offering an alternative way to assess relative economic sizes and standards of living beyond nominal exchange rates.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept                       Impact on Market Demand
1. Increase in price of a substitute good  : Decrease in demand for the original good
2. Increase in price of a complement good : Increase in demand for the original good
3. Increase in income (inferior good)     : Decrease in demand for the original good

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  An increase in the price of a substitute good makes the original good relatively cheaper, thus increasing its demand. Conversely, an increase in the price of a complement good reduces the demand for the original good because they are typically consumed together.  For inferior goods, an increase in income leads to a decrease in demand as consumers switch to superior alternatives.  Pair 2 is incorrectly matched as it describes an inverse relationship.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Inflation Measure                      Characteristic
1. Consumer Price Index (CPI)           : Higher weight for food items compared to Wholesale Price Index (WPI).
2. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)         : Captures changes in the prices of services.
3. GDP Deflator                        : Measures the change in the price level of all goods and services produced domestically.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The CPI gives a higher weight to food items than the WPI, reflecting consumer spending patterns. The GDP deflator is a broad measure of price changes for all domestically produced goods and services.  The WPI, however, does not capture changes in service prices.  Therefore, option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 2.



**4. With reference to India's Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following pairs:**

BoP Component                         Type of Transaction
1.  Remittances from NRIs              : Current Account
2.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)     : Capital and Financial Account
3.  Interest payments on external debt  : Current Account
4.  Dividend payments on foreign equities: Capital and Financial Account


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Remittances are considered private transfers and fall under the current account. FDI is a capital inflow and is recorded in the capital and financial account.  Interest payments on external debt are a current account outflow. Dividend payments, while related to investments, are considered income flows and are part of the current account, not the capital account.  Pair 4 is therefore incorrectly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Financial Instrument                     Feature
1. Commercial Paper                     : Short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations
2. Certificate of Deposit                : Short-term instrument issued by banks
3. Call money                            : Short-term interbank lending

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured debt instrument issued by corporations to raise short-term funds. Certificates of deposit are short-term debt instruments issued by banks. Call money is a short-term borrowing instrument used in the interbank market for overnight or short-term funds.


**6. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

RBI Function                           Authority/Act
1. Appointment of the Governor          : Central Government
2. Issuance of directions to the RBI      : Central Government (in public interest)
3. RBI's regulatory powers               : RBI Act

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Central Government appoints the RBI Governor. The Constitution grants the Central Government the power to issue directions to the RBI in the public interest. The RBI's regulatory powers are derived from the RBI Act.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Type of Foreign Investment         Characteristic
1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)   : Investment less than 10% of equity capital in a listed company.
2. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) :  Investment involving active management and control.
3. Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) : Represent shares of an Indian company traded on foreign exchanges.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. GDRs are instruments that allow foreign investors to trade shares of Indian companies on foreign stock exchanges.  FDI is defined as investment of 10% or more of equity capital in a listed company;  FPI is characterized by minority stakes and less direct involvement in management.  Pairs 1 and 2 are therefore incorrectly matched.


**8. With reference to measures to control the slide of the Indian rupee, consider the following pairs:**

Measure                                    Effect
1. Curbing imports of non-essential goods: Increases the demand for the rupee.
2. Encouraging Masala Bonds              : Increases foreign currency inflows.
3. Following an expansionary monetary policy : Increases the money supply, potentially weakening the rupee.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Reducing imports lowers the demand for foreign currency, strengthening the rupee. Masala bonds attract foreign investment, increasing the supply of rupees and supporting its value. An expansionary monetary policy, however, increases the money supply, potentially leading to inflation and weakening the rupee's value, making pair 3 incorrectly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

Financial Institution                     Regulatory Body
1. Commercial Banks                      : Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
2. Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) : Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)
3.  Insurance Companies                    :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The RBI regulates commercial banks.  NBFCs are regulated by multiple bodies depending on their activities (SEBI for securities, IRDAI for insurance products).  Insurance companies are regulated primarily by IRDAI, not RBI.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched.


**10. With reference to the Indian financial sector, consider the following pairs:**

Committee                                  Focus
1. Narasimhan Committee I                  :  Banking sector reforms
2. Narasimhan Committee II                 :  Financial sector reforms (broader scope)
3.  P.J. Nayak Committee                   :  Governance of PSB boards

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Narasimhan Committee I focused specifically on banking sector reforms.  The Narasimhan Committee II had a broader mandate encompassing the entire financial sector.  The P.J. Nayak Committee addressed governance issues within the boards of public sector banks.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                     Description
1.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :  Improvement in trade competitiveness
2.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     :  Appreciation of Rupee
3.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)         :  Calculated by comparing prices of same basket of goods in different countries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 correctly matches the economic indicator with its description. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of the same basket of goods and services across different countries. This method helps to adjust for differences in price levels between countries and provides a more accurate comparison of economic output and living standards.

Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in NEER indicates an appreciation of the Rupee, not an improvement in trade competitiveness. NEER reflects the value of a country's currency relative to a basket of other currencies, while trade competitiveness depends on factors such as price levels, productivity, and government policies.  A stronger currency (higher NEER) can actually hurt export competitiveness.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. An increase in REER reflects an improvement in trade competitiveness, not an appreciation of the Rupee. REER takes into account both nominal exchange rates and relative inflation rates to measure a country's real exchange rate. A higher REER suggests that a country's goods are becoming relatively more expensive compared to its trading partners, potentially harming its trade balance.  Therefore, an increase in REER does not directly translate to Rupee appreciation.  The relationship is complex and depends on other macroeconomic factors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Concept                      Definition/Characteristic
1.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)        :   Interest and capital gains are non-taxable
2.  Convertible Bonds                      :   Pay a higher rate of interest compared to other bonds
3.  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)          :    Decided by each individual bank


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 correctly describes Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs).  IIBs are designed to protect investors from inflation risk by adjusting their principal and interest payments based on changes in a price index.  While tax treatment can vary by jurisdiction, a key feature often associated with IIBs is that they aim to provide a return that keeps pace with inflation, thereby mitigating the impact of inflation on the investor’s real return.  The tax benefits are often structured to make them attractive investment vehicles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Convertible bonds typically pay a lower rate of interest than comparable non-convertible bonds because of the added option to convert into equity. This option provides investors with potential upside gains if the company's stock price rises, offsetting the lower interest rate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is not decided by individual banks. It is a regulatory requirement set by the central bank (like the Reserve Bank of India) to ensure that banks maintain sufficient capital to absorb potential losses.  Each bank must meet the minimum CAR specified by the regulator, but the individual bank does not set the overall ratio.


**3. With reference to monetary policy tools, consider the following pairs:**

   Monetary Policy Tool                Effect on Money Supply
1. Increase in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) : Increase in money supply
2.  Open Market Operations (OMO) – Sale of Securities : Increase in money supply
3.  Bank Rate Increase                  : Decrease in money supply

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correctly matched.  An increase in the bank rate (the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks) makes borrowing more expensive for commercial banks, reducing their lending capacity and thus decreasing the money supply in the economy.

Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in CRR reduces the money supply.  Commercial banks are required to hold a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves with the central bank. When the CRR increases, banks have less money available to lend, leading to a contraction in the money supply.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Open market operations (OMO) involving the sale of securities by the central bank reduces the money supply. When the central bank sells government securities, it withdraws money from the banking system, reducing the amount available for lending and thus decreasing the overall money supply.


**4.  With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Instrument                    Characteristic
1.  Commercial Paper                     :  Long-term unsecured promissory note
2.  Certificate of Deposit (CD)            :  Issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks
3.  Call Money                             : Used for interbank transactions
4.  Zero Coupon Bonds                     : Interest-bearing short-term bonds


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term debt instruments issued by banks and other financial institutions, and call money is indeed a short-term borrowing instrument frequently used for interbank transactions.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note, not long-term.  It's a vital instrument for short-term corporate financing.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; their return comes from the difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity.  They are not necessarily short-term.


**5. With reference to India's balance of payments, consider the following pairs:**

   Account                                  Transaction Type
1. Current Account                         :  Records international purchases and sales of assets
2. Capital Account                          :  Includes exports and imports of goods and services
3.  Trade Balance                           :  Balance of exports and imports of goods


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correctly matched. The trade balance is specifically the difference between the value of a country's exports and imports of goods.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The current account records transactions in goods, services, and income, including net transfers (like remittances). The capital account deals with the flow of capital, including investments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The capital account records international flows of financial assets (investments, loans, etc.), not trade in goods and services.  The current account focuses on the trade in goods and services.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Office                         Function/Output
1.  Ministry of Commerce and Industry    :    Publication of Consumer Price Index (CPI) data
2.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)           :   Publication of Wholesale Price Index (WPI) data
3.  National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :   Launched RuPay, a card payment scheme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correctly matched. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is indeed responsible for launching RuPay, a domestic card payment network.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Ministry of Commerce and Industry is not responsible for the publication of CPI data.  That falls under the purview of other government statistical agencies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI does not publish the WPI data.  That is typically the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry or a related statistical office within the government.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                          Explanation
1.  Money Multiplier                       : Decreases with an increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
2.  Seigniorage                             : Profit from money creation
3.  Legal Tender Money                    :  Money which a creditor is under compulsion to accept


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correctly matched. The money multiplier is inversely related to the CRR. A higher CRR means less money is available for lending, reducing the money multiplier effect. Seigniorage is the profit a government or central bank makes from issuing currency. Legal tender money refers to currency that creditors must accept for payment of debts.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Measure (Post-1991)          Objective
1. Deregulation of Interest Rates       : To reduce competition in the banking sector
2.  Reduction of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) : To increase banks’ lending capacity
3.  Establishment of SEBI              :   To improve transparency and supervision in capital markets


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Lowering the SLR frees up more funds for banks to lend, stimulating economic activity.  The establishment of SEBI aimed to improve transparency and investor protection in India's capital markets.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Deregulation of interest rates was intended to *increase* competition, not reduce it, by allowing banks to set their own interest rates based on market forces.  This fosters a more efficient allocation of capital.


**9.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Initiative        Primary Goal
1.  Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana       :   Providing pensions to old and destitute persons
2.  Kisan Credit Card Scheme           :   Providing short-term credit support to farmers for various purposes including consumption requirements
3.  Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme         :    To promote FDI in the gold and jewellery sector


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correctly matched. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme provides credit to farmers for various agricultural and allied activities, including meeting their consumption needs during lean periods.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana aims to provide funding to small businesses and entrepreneurs, not to provide pensions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme primarily aims to bring idle gold held by households into the financial system and reduce India's reliance on gold imports, not to promote FDI.


**10.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Concept                       Impact on Aggregate Demand
1.  Increase in Exports                    : Decrease in aggregate demand
2.  Expansionary Fiscal Policy            : Increase in aggregate demand
3.  Increase in Imports                   : Decrease in aggregate demand


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Expansionary fiscal policies (increased government spending or tax cuts) boost aggregate demand. Increased imports represent a leakage from the circular flow of income, reducing domestic aggregate demand.

Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in exports is an injection into the circular flow of income, increasing aggregate demand, not decreasing it.  Exports represent an inflow of money into the domestic economy.


**1. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Indicator                     Description
1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :  Indicates the appreciation of the rupee.
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     : Indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness.
3. Consumer Price Index (CPI)             :  Has a lower weightage of food compared to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

An increase in NEER signifies that the rupee has appreciated relative to a basket of other currencies. An increase in REER indicates an improvement in a country's trade competitiveness as its goods and services become relatively cheaper compared to other countries.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the weightage of food is higher in the CPI than in the WPI. The CPI measures the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of goods and services, including food, which generally holds a significant weight.  The WPI, on the other hand, focuses on wholesale prices and gives less emphasis to services and food items. Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.


**2. With reference to monetary policy in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Monetary Policy Instrument          Effect on Money Supply
1. Repo Rate Increase                  : Increases money supply
2. Reverse Repo Rate Decrease           : Increases money supply
3. Increase in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) : Increases money supply

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A repo rate increase makes borrowing more expensive for commercial banks, thereby reducing their lending capacity and decreasing the money supply. A decrease in the reverse repo rate makes it less attractive for banks to park funds with the central bank, encouraging them to lend more, thus increasing the money supply. An increase in the CRR mandates banks to hold a larger proportion of their deposits as reserves, reducing their lending capacity and hence decreasing the money supply. Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to inflation in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Inflation                     Cause
1. Demand-pull Inflation                 : Expansionary fiscal policies
2. Cost-push Inflation                  : Increase in input prices
3. Inflation-indexing of wages          :  Reduces demand-pull inflation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation arises when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, often fueled by expansionary fiscal policies.  Cost-push inflation occurs when the cost of production increases, such as due to higher input prices (raw materials, wages, etc.), leading to higher prices for goods and services. Inflation-indexing of wages, while potentially impacting the overall price level, does not directly reduce demand-pull inflation; in fact, it can exacerbate cost-push inflation.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                    Description
1.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates : Calculated by comparing prices of a basket of goods in different countries.
2.  Headline inflation                           : Includes food and fuel inflation.
3.  Core inflation                              : Excludes both food and fuel inflation.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries, providing a measure of relative purchasing power. Headline inflation typically includes food and fuel prices, while core inflation excludes these volatile components to provide a more stable measure of underlying inflationary pressures. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Indian banking system, consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                     Definition
1.  Seigniorage                              : Profit from money creation by the central bank.
2.  Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) : Total demand and time deposits of the public with banks.
3.  Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)           :  Amount of reserves banks must maintain with RBI.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Seigniorage accurately describes the profit earned by the central bank from issuing currency. NDTL correctly represents the sum of demand and time deposits held by the public in banks. SLR correctly defines the mandatory reserves banks must maintain, expressed as a percentage of their NDTL, in the form of liquid assets.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to instruments of monetary policy, consider the following pairs:**

    Instrument                                 Function
1.  Repo Rate                                : Rate at which RBI lends to banks overnight.
2.  Reverse Repo Rate                         : Rate at which RBI borrows from banks overnight.
3.  Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)        :  A facility for banks to borrow additional funds at a penal rate.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The repo rate is the rate at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lends money to commercial banks against the security of government securities. The reverse repo rate is the rate at which the RBI borrows money from commercial banks. The MSF is a facility that allows scheduled commercial banks to borrow additional funds from the RBI overnight against the security of government securities.  Thus, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the Indian economy's growth, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                  Description
1.  Real GDP Growth                          : Measures growth in quantity of output.
2.  Nominal GDP Growth                       : Measures growth in value of output (including prices).
3.  Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) : Measures additional capital needed per unit increase in output.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Real GDP growth accurately reflects the change in the physical quantity of goods and services produced, holding prices constant. Nominal GDP growth includes the effect of both changes in quantity and changes in the price level. ICOR precisely measures the efficiency of capital investment by indicating the amount of additional capital needed to generate an additional unit of output.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**8.  With reference to India's balance of payments, consider the following pairs:**

    Account                                   Component
1. Current Account                           : Balance of trade
2. Capital Account                           : Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
3.  Official Reserve Transactions (ORT)      : Changes in foreign exchange reserves

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The current account encompasses the balance of trade (exports and imports of goods and services), net income from investments, and net transfers. The capital account includes FDI, portfolio investment, and other capital flows. ORT records changes in a country's foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank, representing official interventions in the foreign exchange market.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to human capital formation, consider the following pairs:**

    Source of Human Capital                 Example
1.  Investment in Education                : On-the-job training
2.  Investment in Health                  :  Preventive medicine (vaccination)
3.  Investment in Information              :  Research and development expenditure

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While investment in education is a crucial source of human capital, on-the-job training is more accurately categorized as a form of human capital development rather than a primary source. Investment in health, through preventive and curative measures, directly contributes to a healthier and more productive workforce. Investment in information, especially through research and development, enhances knowledge and innovation, boosting overall human capital.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to macroeconomic concepts, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                   Description
1.  Multiplier Effect                         :  Amplification of initial changes in spending.
2.  Paradox of Thrift                         : Increased saving leading to reduced aggregate demand.
3.  Phillips Curve                            :  Inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment (in the short run).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The multiplier effect describes how an initial change in autonomous spending (e.g., government spending, investment) can lead to a larger overall change in aggregate output and income. The paradox of thrift highlights the counterintuitive idea that increased saving by individuals can paradoxically reduce aggregate demand and overall saving in the economy. The short-run Phillips curve illustrates the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment, although this relationship may not hold in the long run.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regulatory Body                     Institution Regulated
1. RBI                                   :   Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SII)
2. SEBI                                  :   Domestic Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI)
3. IRDAI                                 :   Domestic Systemically Important Banks (DSIB)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs).  SEBI regulates Domestically Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) such as commodity exchanges.  The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) regulates Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SII). Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect because the RBI does not directly regulate D-SIIs; that is the purview of IRDAI. Pair 3 is incorrect because the RBI, not IRDAI, designates Domestic Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs).  The question tests factual recall about the regulatory landscape of the Indian financial system, highlighting the distinct roles of RBI, SEBI, and IRDAI in overseeing systemically important institutions.  Understanding these regulatory distinctions is crucial for comprehending the stability and oversight of the Indian financial sector.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Investment Type                      Characteristic
1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)       :   Investment less than 10 percent of the equity capital of a listed Indian company
2. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)    :   Investment through ‘capital instruments’ by a person resident outside India in an unlisted Indian company
3. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)    :   Can invest in Central and State Government securities/bonds

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is defined as investment through capital instruments by a person resident outside India in an unlisted Indian company or in 10 percent or more of the equity capital of a listed Indian company. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) is any investment made by a person resident outside India in capital instruments where such investment is less than 10 percent of the equity capital of a listed Indian company. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. FPIs can invest in Central and State Government securities/bonds, which are treated as debt. Hence, statement 3 is correct. The question assesses the understanding of FDI and FPI definitions and their distinctions, emphasizing the threshold percentage of equity ownership and the types of assets involved.  This is crucial for grasping the nuances of foreign capital flows and their impact on the Indian economy.


**3. With reference to Foreign Investment in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Investment Route                     Description
1. Automatic Route                     :   Requires government approval and scrutiny by respective departments and ministries
2. Government Approval Route           :   Accounts for more than 95% of FDI inflow
3. Automatic Route                     :   Subject only to sectoral laws and regulations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Automatic Route for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India requires no government approval and is subject only to sectoral laws and regulations. More than 95% of FDI comes through this route. The Government Approval Route, on the other hand, involves scrutiny and clearance by the relevant ministries and departments.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly interchange the characteristics of the Automatic and Government Approval routes. This question tests the understanding of FDI inflow mechanisms in India, emphasizing the distinction between the Automatic and Government Approval routes.  Grasping these differences is crucial for analyzing the ease of doing business in India and the government's role in regulating foreign investment.


**4. With reference to Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                   Characteristic
1.  Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs)    :   Incorporated in India
2.  FPIs                                     :   Can invest a maximum of 10% in a single Indian company
3.  FPIs                                     :   Require SEBI approval/license

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) are institutions incorporated *outside* India.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. A single FPI can invest a maximum of 10% in an Indian company, and all FPIs together can invest up to the sectoral cap. Thus, statement 2 is correct. FPIs require SEBI approval/license to operate in India. Therefore, statement 3 is correct. The question assesses knowledge of FPI regulations and characteristics in India, focusing on their incorporation status, investment limits, and regulatory requirements.  Understanding these aspects is important for analyzing the role of FPIs in the Indian capital market and their impact on the economy.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                     Description
1. Global Depository Receipt (GDR)      :   Issued by the Indian company to US investors
2. American Depository Receipt (ADR)    :   Represents shares of a US company held by an Overseas Depository Bank
3. Share Warrant                           :   Gives the holder an obligation to subscribe to equity shares

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A Global Depository Receipt (GDR) is a certificate issued by a depository bank representing shares of a foreign company.  An American Depository Receipt (ADR) is a similar instrument but specifically for US investors and represents shares of a non-US company. A Share Warrant gives the holder the *right*, but not the *obligation*, to subscribe to equity shares.  Therefore, all three pairs are incorrectly matched. The question tests the understanding of various financial instruments used in international capital markets, particularly GDRs, ADRs, and share warrants.  Knowing the characteristics of these instruments is essential for evaluating investment opportunities and international financial transactions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                     Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                      :   Long-term unsecured promissory note
2. Certificate of Deposit                  :   Short-term instrument issued by scheduled commercial banks
3. Call Money                               :   Used for interbank transactions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term debt instruments issued by banks.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Call money is indeed used for short-term interbank transactions.  Therefore, statement 3 is correct.  The question tests the understanding of different short-term financial instruments used in the money market, focusing on their characteristics and applications.  This knowledge is crucial for comprehending the functioning of financial markets and the sources of short-term finance for businesses and banks.


**7. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                      Meaning
1.  Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)          :   Incentive given by a bank to a merchant for accepting debit card payments
2.  Legal Tender Money                     :   Money a creditor is compelled to accept for settling claims
3.  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)         :   Decided by each individual bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is the fee charged to a merchant by a bank for accepting payments through debit cards.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Legal tender money refers to the currency that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in payment of debts.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a regulatory requirement set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not by individual banks.  Therefore, statement 3 is incorrect.  The question assesses understanding of key financial terms used in the Indian context, focusing on their precise meanings.  This knowledge is essential for comprehending banking regulations, payment systems, and monetary policy.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                      Characteristic
1.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)       :   Compares prices of different baskets of goods in different countries
2.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   Indicates improvement in trade competitiveness
3.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) :   Affected by domestic inflation relative to other countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of the *same* basket of goods and services in different countries.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. NEER reflects the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies, but it doesn't directly indicate trade competitiveness; that is better reflected by REER. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  REER considers both nominal exchange rates and relative price levels, making it sensitive to differences in domestic and foreign inflation.  Therefore, statement 3 is correct. The question tests the understanding of different economic indicators and their uses in analyzing exchange rates and price levels.  This knowledge is critical for evaluating macroeconomic performance and policy effectiveness.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                  Purpose
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana            :   Providing loans to poor farmers
2. Kisan Credit Card Scheme               :   Post-harvest expenses support
3. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme             :   Promoting FDI in the gold sector


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme provides short-term credit support to farmers for various purposes, including post-harvest expenses. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. The Sovereign Gold Bond scheme primarily aims to bring idle gold into the economy and reduce reliance on imports, not to promote FDI in the gold sector. Therefore, statement 3 is incorrect.  The question tests the understanding of various government schemes aimed at financial inclusion and rural development.  Knowing the objectives of these schemes is essential for analyzing their impact on the Indian economy and the welfare of different sections of society.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution                             Function
1. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)  :  Issues Treasury Bills
2. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :  Manages Government of India Securities
3. IFSCA                                    :  Regulates business in IFSCs prior to its establishment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) facilitates retail payments and operates the RuPay card scheme, not Treasury Bills issuance.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) manages and services Government of India Securities. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Prior to the establishment of IFSCA, the domestic financial regulators (RBI, SEBI, PFRDA, and IRDAI) regulated business in IFSCs. Therefore, statement 3 is incorrect. This question tests knowledge of the roles of different institutions in the Indian financial system, focusing on their specific functions and responsibilities.  Understanding these roles is crucial for analyzing the structure and functioning of the Indian financial sector.


**11. With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                      Description
1.  Masala Bonds                            :   Issued outside India, denominated in the local currency
2.  External Commercial Borrowing (ECB)   :   Includes bank loans, bonds, and debentures
3.  Currency Swap Agreement (between countries) :  Involves pre-agreed exchange rates


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Masala bonds are issued outside India but are denominated in Indian Rupees, not the local currency of the issuing country. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) encompass various debt instruments, including bank loans, bonds, and debentures. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Currency swap agreements between countries often involve pre-agreed exchange rates to minimize exchange rate risk.  Therefore, statement 3 is correct. This question tests the understanding of international financial instruments and transactions, focusing on their characteristics and applications.  This knowledge is crucial for analyzing capital flows and risk management strategies in the global financial market.


**12.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution                                 Role in Strategic Disinvestment
1. Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) :  Final pricing of transactions
2. NITI Aayog                               :   Identifies PSUs for strategic disinvestment
3.  Alternative Mechanism                   :  Selects strategic partners/buyers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

DIPAM is the nodal department for strategic disinvestment, but the Alternative Mechanism, not DIPAM, makes the final decision on pricing.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. NITI Aayog jointly identifies PSUs for strategic disinvestment with DIPAM. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. The Alternative Mechanism decides on the selection of strategic partners and the terms and conditions of sale. Therefore, statement 3 is correct. This question tests knowledge of the institutional framework for strategic disinvestment in India, focusing on the roles and responsibilities of different organizations.  Understanding this framework is crucial for analyzing the privatization process and its impact on the economy.


**13. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following pairs:**

   Account                                   Type of Transaction
1. Current Account                          :   Transactions that alter assets or liabilities outside India
2. Capital Account                           :   Includes export and import of goods and services
3. Capital Account                           :   Records foreign investments like FDI and FPI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Current Account records transactions that do *not* alter assets or liabilities outside India; it deals with the flow of goods, services, and income. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Current Account, not the Capital Account, includes exports and imports of goods and services.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. The Capital Account does record foreign investments like FDI and FPI, reflecting changes in assets and liabilities. Therefore, statement 3 is correct.  This question tests the understanding of the Balance of Payments (BoP) accounting framework, distinguishing between the Current and Capital accounts and the types of transactions recorded in each.  Knowing this is essential for analyzing a country's international economic transactions and its external financial position.



**1. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s functions, consider the following pairs:**

   Function                                    Specific Aspect
1.  Lender of Last Resort                   :   Extends loans to ensure bank solvency during a bank run
2.  Currency Management                     :   Authorizes selected bank branches to establish currency chests
3.  Oversight of Payment Systems           :   Regulates payment systems under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007
4.  Developmental Role                      :   Allocates funds for contribution to the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The RBI acts as a lender of last resort, providing emergency liquidity to solvent banks facing temporary difficulties to prevent systemic risk and protect depositors. This is crucial for maintaining financial stability. The RBI's currency management function includes overseeing the design, production, and distribution of currency, which involves authorizing banks to hold currency chests on its behalf.  The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, clearly places the RBI in charge of regulating and authorizing payment systems in India. Finally, the RBI's developmental role actively supports priority sectors through schemes and initiatives like the RIDF, aiming to promote inclusive growth and financial inclusion. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to the RBI's Economic Capital Framework (ECF), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Detail
1.  Primary Objective of ECF                 :   Transferring net income to the government
2.  Contingency Risk Buffer Recommendation :   Bimal Jalan Committee's recommendation of 5.5% to 6.5% of the balance sheet
3.  Section Defining ECF Objectives         :    Section 47 of the RBI Act 1934

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While transferring net income to the government is a component of the ECF, it's not the *primary* objective. The primary objective is to ensure the RBI has adequate funds to handle financial system crises.  The Bimal Jalan Committee did indeed recommend a 5.5% to 6.5% contingency risk buffer, and Section 47 of the RBI Act 1934 clearly outlines the two objectives of the ECF. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes the partially correct first pair. Option (b) is incorrect as it only includes the correct second pair. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the partially correct first pair and the correct third pair.


**3. With reference to  cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                      Description
1.  Cryptocurrency                             :   Legal tender issued by a central bank in digital form
2.  e-Rupee (CBDC)                           :   Not legal tender; value derived from limited number of units
3.  Taxation on Cryptocurrency Transactions  :   30% tax on income from transfer, 1% TDS on payments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender and their value is not determined by a central bank but by market forces and their limited supply.  The e-Rupee (CBDC), on the other hand, *is* legal tender issued by the RBI.  The description of cryptocurrencies in pair 2 correctly reflects their characteristics. The taxation details in pair 3 are accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the nature of cryptocurrencies and CBDCs and their tax implications.


**4.  With reference to the Indian Financial System, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution Category                         Specific Example
1.  Scheduled Commercial Banks              :   Coastal Local Area Bank
2.  Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs) :   National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)
3.  All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs)    :    Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Coastal Local Area Bank is a Non-Scheduled bank, not a Scheduled Commercial Bank.  The RBI is the central bank, not an AIFI.  The NPCI, as a non-bank entity operating payment systems, is correctly categorized as an NBFI. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  This question tests the examinee's understanding of the different categories of financial institutions within the Indian financial system.


**5. With reference to RBI's regulatory and supervisory functions, consider the following pairs:**

   Function                                   Specific Power or Action
1.  Bank Regulation                          :   Determining interest rates on all types of deposits
2.  Supervision of Cooperative Banks        :   Supersedes the board of directors of Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) if necessary
3.  Prevention of Money Laundering          :   Requires banks to carry out Know Your Customer (KYC) exercises


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the RBI influences interest rates, it does not determine them for all deposit types; many are market-determined. The RBI does possess the power to supersede the boards of UCBs in the public interest, and KYC norms are indeed a vital part of the RBI's anti-money laundering efforts.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it includes the partially correct first pair. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the partially correct first pair and the correct third pair. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the partially correct first pair.


**6. With reference to  instruments used by the RBI for monetary management, consider the following pairs:**

   Instrument                                  Primary Purpose
1.  Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)                 :   Permanent injection/absorption of liquidity
2.  Open Market Operations (OMO)            :   Regulates the amount of money banks can create
3.  Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS)       :   Absorbs surplus liquidity from large capital inflows

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CRR primarily regulates the amount of money banks can create by controlling their lending capacity. OMOs are used for both permanent (outright OMOs) and temporary (LAF OMOs) liquidity management, not solely permanent. MSS is specifically designed to counteract inflationary pressures from large capital inflows. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, while pair 1 is partially correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs.


**7. With reference to the priority sector lending (PSL) guidelines of the RBI, consider the following pairs:**

   Sector                                     Specific PSL Feature
1.  Agriculture                               :   Includes loans for setting up Compressed Biogas plants
2.  MSME                                      :   Loans up to Rs. 50 crores are included
3.  Revised On-Lending Model                  :   Banks can classify only fresh loans sanctioned by NBFCs as PSL

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect aspects of the RBI's PSL guidelines.  Loans for renewable energy initiatives, such as Compressed Biogas plants, fall under agriculture.  The limit for start-up loans under MSME is indeed up to Rs. 50 crores. The revised on-lending model specifically focuses on fresh loans sanctioned by NBFCs to qualify for PSL.  Therefore, all options except (d) are incorrect, as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**8. With reference to the  types of accounts and deposits in the Indian banking system, consider the following pairs:**

   Account Type                                 Characteristic
1.  Current Account                           :   Earns interest
2.  Recurring Deposit Account                 :   Suitable for regular small savings
3.  Non-Resident External (NRE) Account     :   Interest and principal are taxable

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Current accounts generally do not earn interest. NRE accounts offer tax benefits on interest and principal; they are freely repatriable. Recurring deposit accounts are specifically designed for regular small savings.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they contain at least one incorrectly matched pair. This question assesses the understanding of different account types and their features.


**9. With reference to the  banking sector reforms in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Recommendation                  Specific Focus
1.  Narasimhan Committee I                   :   Phased reduction of SLR to 25%
2.  Narasimhan Committee II                  :   Government equity in nationalized banks reduced to 33%
3.  P.J. Nayak Committee                     :   Establishment of Banks Board Bureau (BBB)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Narasimhan Committee I recommended significant deregulation of the banking sector, including a phased reduction of the SLR.  Narasimhan Committee II focused on enhancing the autonomy and strength of Indian banks, including reducing government equity. The P.J. Nayak Committee proposed the establishment of the BBB to improve governance in PSBs. Therefore, all options except (d) are incorrect, as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  This question tests knowledge of significant committees and their contributions to banking reforms.


**10. With reference to the government securities market in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Security Type                                 Feature
1.  Treasury Bills                               :   Issued by State Governments
2.  Dated Securities                           :   Traded in capital markets like BSE/NSE
3.  Retail Direct Gilt (RDG) Account           :   Allows competitive bidding in primary market


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Treasury bills are issued by the Central Government, not State Governments. The RDG account simplifies access to the government securities market but doesn't allow for participation in competitive bidding.  Dated securities are indeed traded on exchanges like BSE and NSE.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  The question tests the examinee's understanding of different types of government securities and their market characteristics.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the concepts, not just superficial knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Yojana                                    Primary Aim
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana                  :   Providing pension to old and destitute persons
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme                     :   Promoting FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
3. Gold Monetization Scheme                       :   Reducing India’s dependence on gold imports
4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme                      :   Construction of family houses and cold storage facilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana's primary aim is to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system, providing them with access to credit.  Option 1 incorrectly links it to pension schemes. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme aim to bring idle gold into the economy and reduce reliance on imports, respectively. Option 2 incorrectly links the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme to FDI promotion, while Option 3 correctly identifies the Gold Monetization Scheme's goal but incorrectly includes it with the Kisan Credit Card scheme. Option 4 incorrectly attributes house construction and cold storage facility development to the Kisan Credit Card Scheme; its focus is on short-term credit support for working capital, purchasing inputs, and post-harvest expenses.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  Understanding the specific objectives of each scheme is crucial for accurate matching.


**2. With reference to financial instruments in the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Instrument                                          Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                               :   Long-term instrument issued by the RBI
2. Certificate of Deposit                           :   Short-term instrument issued by commercial banks
3. Call Money                                     :   Long-term finance used for interbank transactions
4. Zero-coupon Bonds                              :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks to corporations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note, not a long-term instrument issued by the RBI (Option 1 is incorrect).  Certificates of Deposit are indeed short-term instruments issued by scheduled commercial banks (Option 2 is correct). Call money is used for short-term interbank transactions, not long-term (Option 3 is incorrect). Zero-coupon bonds are not interest-bearing; their return comes from the difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity (Option 4 is incorrect).  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  A clear understanding of the features of each financial instrument is essential to correctly match them with their characteristics.


**3. With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Entity                                  Function/Role
1. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :   Manages and services State Government Securities
2. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                     :   Launched RuPay, a card payment scheme
3. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)                     :   Primarily focused on providing credit to large corporations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The NPCI's primary role is promoting financial inclusion and facilitating interbank payments, not managing state government securities (Option 1 is incorrect).  The RBI did indeed launch RuPay (Option 2 is correct).  SFBs are designed to provide credit to small businesses, small and marginal farmers, and to encourage entrepreneurship, not large corporations (Option 3 is incorrect). Thus, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of the roles of key institutions within the Indian financial system and requires the candidate to differentiate between their functions.


**4. With reference to  measures related to currency crises and the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Measure                                         Effect on Currency Crisis Risk
1. Increasing government expenditure             :   Reduces risk of currency crisis
2. Remittances from Indians abroad              :   Reduces risk of currency crisis
3. Following an expansionary monetary policy    :   Reduces risk of currency crisis


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Increasing government expenditure can actually exacerbate a currency crisis by increasing demand for foreign currency and widening the current account deficit (Option 1 is incorrect). Remittances from Indians abroad do increase foreign currency inflows, thus reducing the risk of a currency crisis (Option 2 is correct). An expansionary monetary policy can also weaken a currency, making it more vulnerable to a crisis (Option 3 is incorrect). Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of macroeconomic policies and their impact on exchange rate stability.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Concept                                    Description
1. Legal tender money                             :   Metallic money in circulation
2. Merchant Discount Rate                         :   Incentive given by a bank to a merchant for accepting payments
3. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)                   :   Decided by each individual bank


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Legal tender money is money that a creditor is compelled to accept in settlement of debts, not just metallic money (Option 1 is incorrect). The Merchant Discount Rate is a charge to a merchant for accepting card payments, not an incentive (Option 2 is incorrect).  CAR is set by regulatory authorities, not individual banks (Option 3 is incorrect). Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of fundamental economic terms and concepts.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Inflation                               Cause/Contributing Factor
1. Demand-pull inflation                          :   Rising interest rates
2. Demand-pull inflation                          :   Higher purchasing power
3. Cost-push inflation                            :   Inflation-indexing wages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Rising interest rates are a contractionary measure used to curb inflation, not a cause of demand-pull inflation (Option 1 is incorrect). Higher purchasing power increases aggregate demand, leading to demand-pull inflation (Option 2 is correct).  Inflation-indexing wages leads to increased production costs, causing cost-push inflation (Option 3 is correct).  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question evaluates the understanding of different types of inflation and their causative factors.



**7. With reference to  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and its actions, consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Action                                     Economic Situation
1. Buying government securities                 :   Inflation is too high
2. Selling dollars in the market                 :   Rupee is rapidly depreciating
3. Buying dollars                                :   Interest rates in the USA fall


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Buying government securities increases money supply, which is counterproductive when inflation is already high (Option 1 is incorrect). Selling dollars in the market increases the supply of rupees, helping to support the rupee's value during depreciation (Option 2 is correct).  When US interest rates fall, capital may flow out of India, putting downward pressure on the rupee; buying dollars helps manage this outflow (Option 3 is correct).  Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question tests the understanding of RBI's monetary policy tools and their application in different economic scenarios.


**8.  With reference to Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) in the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic of IIBs                           Correct Description
1. Coupon rates                                  :   Increased to compensate for inflation
2. Investor protection                             :   Provides protection from inflation uncertainty
3. Tax treatment                                 :   Interest and capital gains are tax-exempt


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Coupon rates on IIBs are adjusted to reflect inflation, reducing the real return to the government, not increased (Option 1 is incorrect).  IIBs do offer protection against inflation uncertainty, a key advantage for investors (Option 2 is correct).  The tax treatment of IIBs varies and isn't universally tax-exempt (Option 3 is incorrect).  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of the features and benefits of inflation-indexed bonds.



**9. With reference to the effects of a tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, consider the following pairs:**

   Effect                                          Correct Description
1. Capital flight from India                        :   Likely consequence
2. Increased interest cost for Indian firms with ECBs:   Likely consequence
3. Decreased currency risk for Indian firms with ECBs:   Likely consequence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

A tight US monetary policy generally leads to capital flight from emerging markets like India, as investors seek higher returns in the US (Option 1 is correct).  This also increases borrowing costs for Indian firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) denominated in foreign currencies (Option 2 is correct).  A tight monetary policy does not decrease currency risk; in fact, it may increase it due to exchange rate fluctuations (Option 3 is incorrect). Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. This question assesses the understanding of international finance and the interconnectedness of global economies.


**10. With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following pairs:**

    Characteristic                                  Correct Description
1. Interest rate                                 :   Higher than comparable non-convertible bonds
2. Indexation to rising consumer prices           :   Offered through the option to convert to equity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Convertible bonds typically offer a lower interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds because of the added option to convert to equity (Option 1 is incorrect). The option to convert to equity does provide a degree of protection against inflation as the value of the equity may rise with inflation (Option 2 is correct).  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question tests the specific characteristics of convertible bonds and their appeal to investors.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy                     Impact
1. Expansionary policies                :   Increased demand-pull inflation
2. Fiscal stimulus                       :   Increased demand-pull inflation
3. Inflation-indexing wages             :   Increased demand-pull inflation
4. Higher purchasing power              :   Increased demand-pull inflation
5. Rising interest rates                 :   Decreased demand-pull inflation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies inject more money into the economy, increasing aggregate demand and leading to demand-pull inflation.  Inflation-indexing wages means that wages automatically rise with inflation, further fueling demand and inflation. Higher purchasing power, resulting from increased income or reduced prices of essential goods, also boosts demand, contributing to inflationary pressures. Rising interest rates, conversely, act as a contractionary measure, reducing borrowing and investment, thereby curbing aggregate demand and potentially mitigating demand-pull inflation.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the relationship between the economic policy and its impact on demand-pull inflation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Action                          Economic Condition
1. Buying government securities       :   High inflation
2. Selling dollars in the market      :   Rapid Rupee depreciation
3. Buying dollars                      :   Falling interest rates in the US/EU

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

When inflation is high, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) typically employs contractionary monetary policies to reduce the money supply.  Buying government securities injects money into the system, counteracting this goal.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI might intervene to support the currency by selling dollars from its foreign exchange reserves. This increases the supply of dollars, potentially pushing the rupee's value upwards. Pair 2 is correctly matched. If interest rates in major economies like the US or EU fall, capital might flow out of India seeking higher returns elsewhere.  To prevent excessive rupee depreciation, RBI might buy dollars, increasing demand for the dollar and potentially stabilizing the exchange rate.  Pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) Feature     Advantage
1. Reduced coupon rates on borrowing          :   Investor protection from inflation uncertainty
2. Protection from inflation uncertainty     :   Reduced coupon rates on government borrowing
3. Taxability of interest and capital gains     :   Investor protection from inflation uncertainty

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) offer protection to investors from inflation uncertainty because the principal and interest payments are adjusted according to inflation. This makes them attractive to risk-averse investors. The government benefits because it can reduce coupon rates (the interest rate paid on the bond) since the principal is protected against inflation.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. The lower coupon rate on borrowing is an advantage for the government, not a feature of the bond itself, so pair 1 is also correctly matched. The taxability of interest and capital gains on IIBs is a separate issue and not directly related to their primary advantage of inflation protection.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   US Federal Reserve Action               Consequence
1. Tight monetary policy                  :   Increased capital flight
2. Capital flight                          :   Increased interest cost for firms with ECBs
3. Devaluation of domestic currency       :   Decreased currency risk associated with ECBs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

A tight monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve typically leads to higher interest rates in the US. This can attract capital from other countries, including India, leading to capital flight from India. Thus, pair 1 is correctly matched. Capital flight reduces the supply of funds in the domestic market, increasing borrowing costs for firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).  Hence, pair 2 is correctly matched. Devaluation of the domestic currency, on the other hand, increases the rupee cost of repaying ECBs, which are denominated in foreign currency. It does not decrease the currency risk; instead it increases it. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Convertible Bond Feature                Characteristic
1. Option to exchange bond for equity     :   Lower interest rate
2. Option to convert to equity            :   Degree of indexation to rising consumer prices

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (c) Both 1 and 2

**Explanation:**

Convertible bonds offer the holder the option to convert the bond into a specified number of shares of the issuing company's stock. Because of this added benefit, convertible bonds usually pay a lower rate of interest compared to traditional bonds.  This is because the potential for equity appreciation compensates for the lower interest payment. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The option to convert to equity provides a degree of protection against inflation because the value of the equity may rise with inflation, offering a hedge against rising consumer prices. This makes pair 2 also correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Indicator                    Consequence of Increase
1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   Rupee appreciation
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)      :   Improved trade competitiveness
3. Domestic inflation relative to other countries: Increased divergence between NEER and REER

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

An increase in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indicates that the domestic currency (the rupee, in this case) has appreciated against a basket of other currencies.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), which adjusts for inflation differences between countries, does not necessarily indicate improved trade competitiveness.  A higher REER means that domestic goods are relatively more expensive compared to foreign goods, potentially harming exports and the trade balance.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrectly matched. If domestic inflation increases relative to inflation in other countries, the NEER (which is a nominal rate) and the REER (which accounts for inflation) will diverge. The NEER might show appreciation, while the REER might show depreciation or vice-versa, leading to an increasing gap between them. Pair 3 is correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Cause of Increased Market Demand for a Good      Condition
1. Price of its substitute increases                  :   Good's price falls
2. Price of its complement increases                 :   Good's price falls
3. Good is inferior and consumer income increases   :   Good's price falls
4. Good's price falls                               :   Price of its substitute increases

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

If the price of a substitute good increases, consumers may switch to the relatively cheaper good, increasing its demand.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. If the price of a complement good increases, the demand for the good in question will likely decrease, as consumers buy less of both goods. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrectly matched. If a good is inferior (meaning its demand decreases as income increases), and consumer income rises, the demand for that inferior good will decrease. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched. A fall in the price of a good itself typically increases its demand, due to the law of demand. Therefore, pair 4 is correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                  Measurement Method
1. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates :   Comparing prices of same basket of goods across countries
2. India's ranking among largest economies     :   Based on PPP dollars
3. Consumer Price Index (CPI) food weightage    :   Higher than Wholesale Price Index (WPI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of an identical basket of goods and services in different countries. This helps in comparing the relative purchasing power of different currencies.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  In terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjusted dollars, India's economy is significantly larger than its nominal GDP ranking suggests, placing it among the world's largest economies. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) gives more weight to food items than the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) because food constitutes a larger share of household expenditure than it does of the overall economy.  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Condition                                     RBI Response
1. High inflation                               :   Sell government securities
2.  Adverse balance of payments situation       :   Devalue the rupee (before 1993)
3.  High volatility and depreciating rupee (post-1993):   Sell dollars from reserves


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

To control high inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) often uses contractionary monetary policy tools. Selling government securities reduces the money supply, thus curbing inflationary pressures. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. Before 1993, India operated under a fixed exchange rate regime. To correct an adverse balance of payments situation (where imports exceeded exports), the RBI would devalue the rupee, making exports cheaper and imports more expensive. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. Post-1993, India adopted a managed floating exchange rate system. If the rupee depreciates excessively, the RBI may intervene by selling dollars from its foreign exchange reserves to increase the supply of dollars and support the rupee. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Macroeconomic Variable                     Definition/Characteristic
1.  Narrow Money                              :   Currency + Demand Deposits
2.  Broad Money                               :   Narrow Money + Time Deposits
3.  Aggregate Monetary Resources (M3)        :   Broad Money - Time Deposits of Post Office Savings Organisations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Narrow money (M1) is a measure of the most liquid components of the money supply. It typically includes currency in circulation and demand deposits held by commercial banks. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. Broad money (M3) includes narrow money plus less liquid components like time deposits held by commercial banks and other financial institutions. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. Aggregate monetary resources (M3) encompass all components of broad money, including time deposits of Post Office Savings Organisations.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched.  The definition in pair 3 subtracts these deposits, making it incorrect.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

    RBI Policy Instrument                     Purpose
1. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)                  :   Control money creation by banks
2. Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)            :   Ensure bank solvency and liquidity
3. Open Market Operations (OMO)              :   Adjust liquidity in the economy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) mandates that banks maintain a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This restricts the amount of money banks can lend and create, thus influencing the money supply.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requires banks to hold a certain portion of their deposits in liquid assets like government securities. This ensures the banks' solvency and ability to meet sudden withdrawal demands. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. Open Market Operations (OMO) involve the RBI buying or selling government securities in the open market to inject or absorb liquidity in the economy.  This is a key tool for managing short-term interest rates and overall money supply. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Open Market Operation           Characteristic
1. Outright OMOs                           :   Permanent in nature
2. LAF OMOs                               :   Repurchase agreements (repos)
3. Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS)       :   Absorbs enduring surplus liquidity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Outright Open Market Operations (OMOs) are permanent transactions where the central bank buys or sells securities without an agreement to reverse the transaction.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) OMOs involve repurchase agreements (repos) or reverse repos, where securities are bought or sold with an agreement to repurchase or resell them at a future date.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. The Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS) was introduced to absorb large and persistent liquidity surpluses arising from significant capital inflows. This helps in managing inflation and exchange rate stability. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.  All three pairs accurately describe the characteristics of the respective OMO types.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Reform Measure                     Aim
1. SEBI establishment                         :   Transparency and supervision in capital markets
2. Opening capital market to portfolio investments:   Access to international capital markets for Indian companies
3. Repeal of Capital Issues Control Act       :   Abolish government control over equity pricing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was established to regulate and supervise the securities market, promoting transparency and investor protection. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. Opening up the capital market to portfolio investments allowed foreign investors to invest in Indian securities, providing access to international capital markets for Indian companies to raise capital. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. The repeal of the Capital Issues Control Act removed government control over the pricing of new equity issues by private companies, promoting a more market-driven approach. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.  All three measures aimed at liberalizing and deepening the Indian capital market.


**1. With reference to the Indian economy and monetary policy, consider the following pairs:**

   Instrument/Tool                         Function/Effect
1. Repo Rate                              :   Absorbs liquidity from banks overnight
2. Reverse Repo Rate                     :   Provides overnight liquidity to banks
3. Standing Deposit Facility (SDF)        :   Available only at the discretion of RBI
4. Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)       :   Allows banks to borrow above repo limit using SLR portfolio
5. Bank Rate                              :   Dormant instrument; aligned with MSF rate


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Repo Rate is the interest rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks, injecting liquidity into the system.  The Reverse Repo Rate is the rate at which the RBI borrows money from commercial banks, absorbing liquidity.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect, and pair 2 is correct. The SDF allows banks to deposit funds with the RBI at the repo rate, offering flexibility and acting as a floor for interest rates.  This makes pair 3 incorrect. The MSF allows banks to borrow additional funds beyond the repo limit by using their SLR portfolio, making pair 4 correct. The Bank Rate is currently aligned with the MSF rate and is used for penalty calculations, making pair 5 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Indian economy and inflation, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                   Characteristic
1. Demand-pull inflation                    :   Caused by sluggish growth of aggregate demand
2. Headline inflation in India               :   Based on Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
3. Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)         :   Interest and capital gains are tax-exempt
4. Combating Inflation                      :   Increasing non-planned expenditure on defence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand outpaces aggregate supply, leading to rising prices.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Headline inflation in India is based on the Consumer Price Index – Combined (CPI-C), not the WPI. Pair 2 is incorrect. Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) offer protection against inflation by adjusting returns based on inflation rates; however, tax implications vary and are not universally tax-exempt.  Pair 3 is partially correct; the tax treatment depends on the specific IIB.  Increasing interest rates on savings and fixed deposits is a measure to combat inflation by reducing spending and increasing savings. Increasing government expenditure generally fuels inflation. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect. Only pair 3 has a partially correct element, making (c) the most appropriate answer.


**3. With reference to Indian banking and financial institutions, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                     Characteristic
1. Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) :   Can accept demand deposits
2. e-RUPI prepaid digital vouchers          :   Requires a bank account for receipt
3. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)              :   Primarily responsible for determining SLR
4.  State Provident Funds money             :   Credited to the Contingency Fund


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

NBFCs cannot accept demand deposits; this is a key distinction between them and banks.  Pair 1 is incorrect. e-RUPI vouchers can be received without a bank account, making pair 2 incorrect. The RBI regulates and supervises the banking system, including setting reserve requirements like the SLR; however, the precise mechanisms for setting the SLR involve the government and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Pair 3 is partially correct as the RBI plays a key role. Money received by the government under State Provident Funds is credited to the Consolidated Fund, not the Contingency Fund. Pair 4 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 3 has a partially correct element, making (c) the most appropriate answer considering the other options.


**4. With reference to Indian fiscal policy and government accounts, consider the following pairs:**

   Account/Fund                           Description
1. Consolidated Fund of India (CFI)      :   Receives only tax revenues
2. Contingency Fund of India              :   Requires parliamentary authorization for all withdrawals
3. Public Account of India                 :   Includes receipts from sale of savings certificates
4. Revenue Deficit                        :   Difference between total expenditure and total receipts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CFI receives various revenues, including tax revenues and other receipts, making pair 1 incorrect. The Contingency Fund allows for unforeseen expenses without immediate parliamentary approval, but the expenditure needs subsequent parliamentary ratification.  Pair 2 is incorrect. The Public Account includes various receipts, including those from the sale of savings certificates, making pair 3 correct. Revenue deficit is the difference between revenue expenditure and revenue receipts, not total expenditure and receipts. Pair 4 is incorrect. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**5. With reference to India's economic development and policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Measure                          Objective/Effect
1. Devaluation of the Rupee               :   Reduces exports
2. Fiscal Stimulus                         :   Reduces inflation
3. New Economic Policy (NEP) of 1991     :   Increased the role of the government
4.  Reduction in export subsidy           :   Improves current account deficit


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Devaluation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, thus improving the trade balance. Pair 1 is incorrect. Fiscal stimulus increases aggregate demand, which can increase inflation. Pair 2 is incorrect. The NEP aimed at reducing government intervention and promoting liberalization, privatization, and globalization. Pair 3 is incorrect. Reducing export subsidies can help improve the current account balance by reducing outflows. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.



**6. With reference to the Indian economy and economic indicators, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                             Interpretation
1. Increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER):   Indicates depreciation of the Rupee
2. Increase in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER):      Indicates worsening trade competitiveness
3. High saving economy and high capital-output ratio:     Results in significant increase in output


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

An increase in NEER indicates appreciation of the Rupee, not depreciation.  Pair 1 is incorrect. An increase in REER indicates improved trade competitiveness, not worsening. Pair 2 is incorrect. A high capital-output ratio means that a large amount of capital investment is required to generate a unit of output, which can hinder economic growth.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.  None of the pairs are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the Indian economy and government finances, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                 Description/Effect
1. Revenue Expenditure                      :   Creates assets or reduces liabilities
2. Capital Expenditure                      :   Does not create assets or reduce liabilities
3. Fiscal Deficit                             :   Always signifies a more expansionary fiscal policy
4.  Revenue Deficit                           :   Indicates current expenses exceed current revenues


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Revenue expenditure relates to the day-to-day functioning of the government and does not create assets. Pair 1 is incorrect. Capital expenditure is investment that creates assets or reduces liabilities. Pair 2 is incorrect. Fiscal deficits don't always indicate an expansionary fiscal policy; they can also occur due to economic downturns. Pair 3 is incorrect. Revenue deficit occurs when current revenue expenditures exceed current revenue receipts. Pair 4 is correct. Only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**8. With reference to government borrowing and deficit financing, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Borrowing                       Source/Method
1. Market Borrowing                       :   Borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
2. Borrowing from banks                   :   A form of deficit financing
3. Borrowing from abroad                  :   Part of fiscal deficit
4. Monetization of deficit                 :    Selling government securities in the open market


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Market borrowing involves raising funds from the public by issuing government securities, not from the RBI. Pair 1 is incorrect. Borrowing from banks is a method of deficit financing. Pair 2 is correct. Borrowing from abroad is a component of fiscal deficit, representing external borrowing. Pair 3 is correct. Monetization of deficit involves the RBI printing money to finance the deficit, not selling securities. Pair 4 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to the functions of money, consider the following pairs:**

   Function of Money                       Description
1. Medium of Exchange                    :   Storing wealth for future use
2. Unit of Account                         :   Expressing the value of goods and services in monetary units
3. Store of Value                          :   Facilitating transactions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The medium of exchange function facilitates transactions, not storing wealth. Pair 1 is incorrect. The unit of account function expresses the value of goods and services in monetary terms. Pair 2 is correct. The store of value function involves holding money to preserve purchasing power over time. Pair 3 is incorrect.  Only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**10. With reference to the Indian banking system and RBI regulations, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation/Ratio                        Purpose/Effect
1. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)              :   Increases the amount of money banks can create
2. Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)        :   Makes public deposits less safe
3. Open Market Operations (OMO)           :   Always involves outright purchases or sales of securities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

CRR reduces the amount of money banks can create by mandating a certain percentage of deposits to be held as reserves. Pair 1 is incorrect. SLR enhances the safety of public deposits by requiring banks to maintain a certain level of liquid assets. Pair 2 is incorrect. OMOs can involve outright transactions or repurchase agreements (repos), depending on the RBI's objectives. Pair 3 is incorrect. None of the pairs are correctly matched.



**1. With reference to the Indian Financial System, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution Category                                     Defining Characteristic
1.  Scheduled Commercial Bank                     :   Included in the Second Schedule of the RBI Act, 1934
2.  Non-Scheduled Commercial Bank                 :   Can deal in Foreign Exchange
3.  Urban Cooperative Bank (UCB)                   :   Registered under the State Government Cooperative Societies Act only
4.  Multi-State Urban Cooperative Bank (UCB)       :   Regulated by the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies (CRCS)
5. Regional Rural Bank (RRB)                      :   Owned by Central, State Governments and a sponsor bank in 50:15:35 ratio

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Scheduled Commercial Banks are indeed defined by their inclusion in the Second Schedule of the RBI Act, 1934.  This is a fundamental characteristic differentiating them from non-scheduled banks.  Multi-State UCBs are correctly paired with their regulatory body, the CRCS, as per the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002.  Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) are also correctly matched with their unique ownership structure, a tripartite arrangement between the Central government, the concerned State government, and a sponsor bank.

Option (a) is incorrect because statement 3 is false; UCBs can be registered under either the State Government Cooperative Societies Act or the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002, depending on their scope. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 2 is false; Non-Scheduled commercial banks are *not* allowed to deal in foreign exchange.  Option (d) is incorrect because statement 3 is false, as explained above.  The question tests factual recall of the regulatory framework governing different financial institutions in India, a key area in UPSC examinations related to Indian Polity and Governance and Economics.


**2. Consider the following pairs related to the Indian Financial System:**

   Type of Bank                                      Operational Characteristic
1. Commercial Banks                               :   Operate on cooperative principles
2. Cooperative Banks                              :   Provide higher interest rates on deposits compared to commercial banks
3. Scheduled Banks                                :   Maintain reserve requirements with RBI as per the RBI Act, 1934
4. Non-Scheduled Banks                           :   Allowed to deal in Foreign Exchange transactions
5. Public Sector Banks                            :   Owned by private individuals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Cooperative banks are correctly paired with their characteristic of offering higher interest rates on deposits than commercial banks. This reflects their cooperative, member-centric operational model. Scheduled banks are accurately linked to their obligation to maintain reserve requirements with the RBI, as mandated by the RBI Act, 1934. This is a crucial aspect of their regulatory compliance.

Option (b) is incorrect because statements 1 and 5 are false; Commercial banks operate on commercial principles, not cooperative ones, and public sector banks are owned by the government, not private individuals. Option (c) is incorrect because it only includes one correct pair. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 4 is false; Non-scheduled banks have limited operational scope and are not permitted to conduct foreign exchange transactions.  The question assesses conceptual understanding of the differences between various types of banks in India, a crucial aspect for understanding the Indian financial system.


**3. With reference to e-RUPI, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of e-RUPI                                  Description
1.  Digital Voucher                               :   A digital/virtual currency
2.  Powered by                                     :   IMPS platform
3.  Redemption                                    :   Only at specific designated centres
4.  Transferability                                :   Transferable to other persons
5.  Accessibility                                  :   Requires internet access for redemption


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The correct matching is only for pair 3.  e-RUPI is a digital voucher, and it can only be redeemed at specific designated centers. This is a key feature of its design to ensure targeted delivery of benefits.

Option (b) is incorrect; e-RUPI is *not* a digital/virtual currency, and it runs on the UPI platform, not IMPS. Option (c) is incorrect; e-RUPI is not transferable to other persons, and it is not powered by the IMPS platform. Option (d) is incorrect; e-RUPI does not require internet access for redemption. This question tests the understanding of the specific features of e-RUPI, a government initiative aimed at improving the delivery of welfare benefits.


**4. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following pairs:**

   BoP Component                                   Type of Transaction
1.  Current Account                               :   Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
2.  Capital Account                               :   Remittances from NRIs
3.  Capital and Financial Account                 :   Loans from international agencies
4.  Current Account                               :   Interest payments on foreign loans
5.  Financial Account                             :   Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Explanation:**

Loans from international agencies are correctly classified under the Capital and Financial Account of the BoP.  Interest payments on foreign loans are accurately categorized under the Current Account.  Foreign Portfolio Investments (FPIs) are correctly placed within the Financial Account.

Option (a) is incorrect because statement 1 is false; FDI falls under the Capital and Financial Account. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 and 2 are both false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is false; Remittances from NRIs fall under the Current Account. This question assesses the understanding of the components of the Balance of Payments and the classification of different types of international transactions.


**5. Consider the following pairs relating to the functions and characteristics of money:**

   Concept                                          Description
1.  Fiat Money                                     :   Has intrinsic value like gold or silver
2.  Legal Tender                                  :   Can be refused for payment settlement
3.  Demand Deposits                               :   Are legal tender
4.  M1 (Money Supply Measure)                     :   Includes net time deposits of commercial banks
5.  M3 (Money Supply Measure)                     :   Is the most commonly used measure of money supply


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 5 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 5 is correctly matched.  M3 is indeed the most commonly used measure of money supply in India.

Option (a) is incorrect; Fiat money does *not* have intrinsic value, and legal tender *cannot* be refused for payment settlements. Option (b) is incorrect; Demand deposits are *not* legal tender, and M1 does *not* include net time deposits. Option (d) is incorrect; legal tender cannot be refused for payment, and M1 does not include net time deposits. This question tests the understanding of the different types of money and the components of money supply measures.


**6. With reference to RBI's functions and operations, consider the following pairs:**

   Source of RBI Income                                     Description
1.  Investment in US Government Bonds                  :   Earns interest on holdings
2.  Open Market Operations (OMO) – Purchase of Govt. Bonds :   Involves lending at the repo rate
3.  Acting as Debt Manager for Central/State Govts.     :   Receives commission/income
4.  Seigniorage                                          :   Profit from money creation
5.  Repo Rate                                             :  A measure of risk in terms of capital


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The RBI does earn interest on its investments in US government bonds.  Its role as debt manager for governments generates commission income. Seigniorage is correctly defined as profit from money creation.

Option (b) is incorrect; OMOs do not involve lending at the repo rate; the repo rate is a policy tool used by the RBI to influence liquidity in the banking system, and it is not a measure of risk. Option (c) is incorrect for the same reason as option (b). Option (d) is incorrect because it only contains two of the correctly matched pairs. This question tests knowledge of the sources of RBI's revenue and its various functions.


**7. With reference to Foreign Investment in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Investment Type                                    Characteristic
1.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)                 :   Investment less than 10% of equity capital in a listed company
2.  Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)              :   Investment through capital instruments in an unlisted company
3.  Global Depository Receipt (GDR)                :   Share issued by an Overseas Depository Bank representing shares of an Indian company
4.  External Commercial Borrowing (ECB)          :   Always denominated in Indian Rupees
5.  Masala Bonds                                    :   A type of ECB where the investor bears the currency risk


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

A GDR is accurately described as a share issued by an Overseas Depository Bank, representing shares of an Indian company. Masala Bonds are correctly paired with the characteristic that the investor bears the currency risk.

Option (a) is incorrect; FDI is defined as investment of 10% or more in a listed company or investment in an unlisted company, and FPI is investment less than 10% of equity capital in a listed company. Option (c) is incorrect because statements 2 and 4 are false; FPI can also happen through primary market, and ECB can be in foreign currency or Indian Rupee. Option (d) is incorrect because statements 1 and 4 are false, as explained above. This question assesses the understanding of different types of foreign investments in India and their characteristics.


**8.  Consider the following pairs regarding Systemically Important Institutions (SIIs) in India:**

   Institution Type                                    Determining Factor for Designation
1. Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) :   Asset size of more than 1% of GDP
2. Domestically Systemically Important NBFCs          :   Asset size of more than Rs. 500 crores
3. Domestically Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs):  Value of assets under management and premium underwritten
4. Domestically Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) :  Market capitalization exceeding Rs. 10,000 crores
5.  "Too Big to Fail" Institutions                     :  Always owned by the Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The asset size threshold of Rs. 500 crores for designating Domestically Systematically Important NBFCs is correct.  The consideration of assets under management and premium underwritten for D-SIIs is also accurate.

Option (b) is incorrect because statement 1 is false;  The asset size threshold for DSIBs is more than 2% of GDP. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 and 4 are false, as explained above. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 5 is false; "Too big to fail" institutions are not always owned by the government.  This question tests the understanding of the criteria for designating systemically important institutions in the Indian financial sector.  This is a complex topic requiring detailed knowledge of financial regulations.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of Indian economic policy and governance.

3. Falling Interest Rates in the EU/USA :   Purchase of Rupees in the Market

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because only the second pair accurately reflects RBI's typical response to economic situations.  When the rupee depreciates rapidly, the RBI intervenes to support the domestic currency by selling dollars from its foreign exchange reserves. This increases the supply of dollars in the market, pushing the value of the rupee upwards.

Option (a) is incorrect because when inflation is high, the RBI typically *sells* government securities (not buys them) to reduce the money supply and curb inflationary pressures.  Buying securities injects liquidity into the market, which is counterproductive to controlling inflation.

Option (c) is incorrect for the reason stated above, regarding inflation.  Furthermore, if interest rates in the US or EU fall, it might lead to capital outflows from India (as investors seek higher returns elsewhere), potentially causing rupee depreciation.  In such a scenario, the RBI might sell dollars (not buy them) to manage the exchange rate. This differs from the given option.

Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in pairs 1 and 3.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs) Feature     Correct Description
1. Coupon Rates                               :   Increased to compensate for inflation
2. Investor Protection                        :   Shields against inflation uncertainty
3. Taxability of Returns                      :   Interest and capital gains are tax-exempt

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because only the second pair is accurate. Inflation-indexed bonds are designed to protect investors from the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation. The principal and interest payments are adjusted based on the inflation rate.

Option (a) is incorrect.  Coupon rates on IIBs are typically *lower* than those on conventional bonds because the principal is adjusted for inflation, reducing the investor's risk.

Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is wrong.

Option (d) is incorrect because statements 1 and 3 are wrong.  The tax treatment of IIBs varies depending on jurisdiction and specific bond terms; they are not universally tax-exempt.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Outcome                     Cause
1. Capital Flight                             :   Loose Monetary Policy by US Federal Reserve
2. Increased Interest Costs on ECBs        :   Capital Flight
3. Reduced Currency Risk on ECBs           :   Domestic Currency Appreciation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct.  A tight (contractionary, not loose) monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve often leads to capital flight as investors seek higher returns elsewhere. This capital flight, in turn, increases the interest cost for firms with existing External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) as the demand for funds increases and the domestic currency depreciates.

Option (b) is incorrect because while capital flight does increase interest costs on ECBs (pair 2 is correct), a domestic currency appreciation would *reduce*, not increase, currency risk associated with ECBs.

Option (c) is incorrect because while a tight US monetary policy can cause capital flight (pair 1 is correct), the statement on currency risk is incorrect.

Option (d) is incorrect due to the error in pair 3.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Convertible Bond Feature              Correct Description
1. Interest Rate Paid                       :   Higher than comparable non-convertible bonds
2. Indexation to Inflation                  :   Provided through the option to convert to equity
3. Conversion to Equity                     :   Occurs at a predetermined price


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Convertible bonds offer a degree of indexation to rising consumer prices because the option to convert to equity provides a hedge against inflation.  If inflation rises significantly, the value of the underlying equity may increase, offering protection to the bondholder.

Option (a) is incorrect. Convertible bonds typically pay a *lower* interest rate than comparable non-convertible bonds because of the added benefit of the conversion option.

Option (c) is partially correct; however, the conversion is not always at a predetermined price, it may also depend on market conditions.

Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 is wrong.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Demand-Pull Inflation Cause           Correct Description
1. Expansionary Monetary Policy           :   Increases money supply, boosting demand
2. Fiscal Stimulus                         :   Increases government spending, raising demand
3. Inflation-Indexing Wages               :   Reduces real wages, dampening demand
4. Higher Purchasing Power                :   Increases consumer spending, raising demand
5. Rising Interest Rates                   :   Reduces borrowing and investment, dampening demand


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. Expansionary monetary policies, fiscal stimulus, and higher purchasing power all contribute to increased aggregate demand, which can lead to demand-pull inflation.

Option (b) is incorrect. While rising interest rates can curb demand (and therefore inflation), inflation-indexed wages do not necessarily dampen demand, as they adjust for inflation's impact on purchasing power.

Option (c) and (d) are incorrect because rising interest rates counteract, rather than contribute to, demand-pull inflation.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept                     Description
1. Recessionary Gap                  :   The amount by which the equilibrium level of real GDP falls short of the full employment level of GDP
2. Inflationary Gap                   :   The amount by which the equilibrium level of real GDP exceeds the full employment level of GDP
3. Income Multiplier                  : A measure of the change in aggregate income resulting from a change in autonomous expenditure
4. Automatic Stabilizer               :  A feature of the economy that automatically reduces the impact of economic shocks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

A recessionary gap occurs when aggregate demand is insufficient to achieve full employment output, leading to underutilized resources and a lower equilibrium GDP than potential GDP.  Conversely, an inflationary gap emerges when aggregate demand exceeds the economy's full-employment output, causing upward pressure on prices and potentially unsustainable economic growth. The income multiplier demonstrates the amplified effect of a change in autonomous spending (like government spending or investment) on overall national income.  Each additional unit of autonomous spending leads to multiple rounds of increased spending and income, resulting in a total increase in income greater than the initial injection. An automatic stabilizer is a policy or mechanism that automatically cushions the economy against economic fluctuations.  Progressive tax systems, unemployment benefits, and other social safety nets serve as examples of automatic stabilizers, mitigating the severity of recessions and booms. Option (d) accurately captures these definitions. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes the definition of a recessionary gap. Option (b) omits the accurate definition of an automatic stabilizer. Option (c) incorrectly pairs inflationary gap with automatic stabilizer.

**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Goods                                    Inclusion in Food Inflation Index (India)
1. Wheat                                :   Included
2. Paddy                               :   Included
3. Tobacco                             :   Not Included
4. Sugar                               :   Included

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Indian food inflation index comprises essential food items that significantly impact household budgets and overall price levels.  Wheat, paddy (rice), and sugar are staple foods and major components of the diet for a significant portion of the population. Their price fluctuations directly affect food inflation. Tobacco, while an agricultural product, is not typically included in measures of food inflation as it's not a primary food item for most consumers.  The inclusion of wheat, paddy, and sugar reflects their substantial contribution to the overall consumption basket and their sensitivity to factors influencing food prices, such as weather patterns, agricultural policies, and supply chain dynamics. The omission of tobacco aligns with the focus on measuring food price changes, distinguishing it from other agricultural commodities.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly include tobacco or incorrectly exclude one or more of the staple food items.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept                                  Description
1. Paradox of Thrift                             :  Increased saving leads to decreased aggregate demand and lower overall savings
2. Output Multiplier                              : The ratio of the total increment in equilibrium value of final goods output to the initial increment in autonomous expenditure
3. Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)        : The fraction of additional income that is spent on consumption

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The Paradox of Thrift highlights a counterintuitive macroeconomic phenomenon: when individuals attempt to save more during economic uncertainty, the resulting decrease in aggregate demand can lead to lower overall savings. This occurs because reduced consumption decreases business revenues and investment, leading to job losses and further decreases in income and savings. The output multiplier quantifies the extent to which a change in autonomous spending (e.g., investment, government spending) affects the overall output of an economy.  A higher multiplier indicates that a small change in autonomous spending will cause a larger change in output, while a smaller multiplier suggests a less pronounced effect. The Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is a key concept in Keynesian economics, representing the proportion of additional income that individuals or households spend on consumption.  It's a crucial determinant of the output multiplier; a higher MPC leads to a larger multiplier effect. All three concepts are accurately described in option (d), making it the correct choice. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting one or more of the accurate descriptions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator                          Description
1. Nominal GDP                               : The total value of goods and services produced in an economy at current market prices.
2. Real GDP                                  :  The total value of goods and services produced in an economy adjusted for inflation.
3. Per Capita GDP                             : GDP divided by the total population of a country.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Nominal GDP measures the total output of an economy at current market prices, without adjusting for inflation.  It reflects both changes in the quantity of goods and services produced and changes in their prices. Real GDP, on the other hand, adjusts the nominal GDP for inflation, providing a more accurate representation of the actual change in the quantity of goods and services produced. It uses a base year’s prices to calculate the value of output in subsequent years, isolating the effect of quantity changes.  Per capita GDP is a crucial indicator of a nation's average standard of living. It's derived by dividing the total GDP by the population size, giving a measure of GDP per person.  Option (d) accurately defines all three indicators.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they either miss one or more of the correct definitions or include inaccurate descriptions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept                             Description
1. Capital-Output Ratio                       : The amount of capital required to produce one unit of output.
2. Incremental Capital-Output Ratio (ICOR) : The additional capital needed to produce one additional unit of output.
3. Productivity                               : Output per unit of input.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The capital-output ratio is a fundamental economic concept that measures the efficiency of capital investment in generating output.  A lower ratio indicates greater efficiency, meaning that less capital is needed to produce a given amount of output. The incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR) is closely related but focuses on the additional capital investment needed to increase output by one more unit.  It's a useful metric for assessing the efficiency of new investments and their impact on economic growth.  Productivity, in its broadest sense, measures the output generated per unit of input.  This can refer to labor productivity (output per worker), capital productivity (output per unit of capital), or total factor productivity (output per unit of combined inputs). Option (d) accurately captures the meaning of all three terms. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, missing one or more accurate descriptions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept                                  Description
1. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Exchange Rate:  Exchange rate calculated by comparing prices of a basket of goods and services in different countries.
2. Nominal Exchange Rate                         : The market price of one currency in terms of another.
3. Real Exchange Rate                             : The relative price of foreign goods in terms of domestic goods, considering nominal exchange rates and price levels.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate is a theoretical exchange rate that equalizes the purchasing power of different currencies.  It's calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries.  A PPP exchange rate reflects the relative purchasing power of currencies, adjusting for differences in price levels. The nominal exchange rate is simply the market-determined exchange rate between two currencies. It's the price of one currency expressed in terms of another.  Fluctuations in nominal exchange rates reflect changes in the supply and demand for currencies in the foreign exchange market. The real exchange rate adjusts the nominal exchange rate for differences in price levels between countries.  It provides a more accurate picture of a country's international competitiveness, considering both the nominal exchange rate and the relative prices of goods and services. Option (d) provides accurate definitions for all three exchange rate concepts. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, missing one or more accurate descriptions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Macroeconomic Aggregate                      Description
1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)              : The total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given period.
2. Net National Product (NNP)                : GDP minus depreciation.
3. Gross National Product (GNP)              : The total market value of all final goods and services produced by a country's residents, regardless of location.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a fundamental macroeconomic indicator measuring the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country's geographical boundaries during a specific period.  It's a key indicator of a nation's economic output and growth. Net National Product (NNP) adjusts GDP to account for capital depreciation, which is the reduction in the value of capital goods over time due to wear and tear or obsolescence.  NNP represents a more accurate measure of an economy's net output after accounting for the consumption of capital. Gross National Product (GNP) differs from GDP by focusing on the output produced by a country's residents, regardless of their geographical location.  This means it includes the output generated by citizens working abroad but excludes the output generated by foreign nationals working within the country. Option (d) accurately defines all three macroeconomic aggregates. The other options are incomplete, failing to accurately describe all three terms.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

Type of Exchange Rate System                  Description
1. Fixed Exchange Rate System                 :  The exchange rate is fixed by the government or central bank.
2. Floating Exchange Rate System               : The exchange rate is determined by market forces of supply and demand.
3. Managed Float Exchange Rate System         : The exchange rate is primarily market-determined, but the central bank intervenes to manage volatility.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

A fixed exchange rate system involves a government or central bank setting a specific exchange rate for its currency relative to another currency or a basket of currencies.  The authorities intervene in the foreign exchange market to maintain the fixed rate. A floating exchange rate system allows the exchange rate to fluctuate freely based on the market forces of supply and demand for the currency.  No government intervention is involved in determining the rate. A managed float, also known as a dirty float, is a hybrid system where the exchange rate is primarily determined by market forces but the central bank intervenes to manage excessive volatility or to influence the exchange rate within a certain range.  This intervention can involve buying or selling the currency in the foreign exchange market. Option (d) accurately describes all three exchange rate systems.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to provide accurate descriptions of all three systems.



**1. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                          Description
1.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)   :  Reflects the value of the rupee against a basket of currencies, adjusted for inflation.
2.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)      :  Measures the competitiveness of a country's exports, considering both nominal exchange rates and price levels.
3.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)                :  Tracks changes in the price of a basket of goods and services purchased by consumers.
4.  Wholesale Price Index (WPI)              :  Measures changes in the prices of goods traded in bulk at the wholesale level.
5.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)            :  Compares the prices of the same basket of goods and services in different countries to determine relative exchange rates.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  NEER reflects the value of the rupee against a basket of currencies at current prices. REER adjusts the NEER for inflation, reflecting the real purchasing power of the rupee and indicating competitiveness. CPI tracks retail prices for a basket of consumer goods.  WPI focuses on wholesale prices, providing a different perspective on inflation. PPP is a method of comparing economic productivity and standards of living between countries using a common currency. These indicators are crucial for understanding various aspects of the Indian economy, including inflation, exchange rate dynamics, and international competitiveness.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude some of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to Indian fiscal policy, consider the following pairs:**

   Fiscal Concept                          Definition/Characteristic
1.  Fiscal Stimulus                        :   Government's intensive action on financial institutions to ensure disbursement of loans to agriculture.
2.  Revenue Deficit                        :   Excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts.
3.  Capital Expenditure                    :   Investment in acquiring new technology.
4.  Fiscal Deficit                          :    The borrowing requirement of the government.
5.  Value Added Tax (VAT)                 :   A tax levied on the final consumption of goods and services.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  A fiscal stimulus is a broader policy aimed at boosting economic activity, not solely focused on agricultural loans. Revenue deficit is the difference between revenue expenditure and revenue receipts, showing the extent to which the government needs to borrow to meet its operational expenses.  Capital expenditure involves investment in assets, including new technology. A fiscal deficit represents the government's total borrowing needs, encompassing both revenue and capital expenditures. VAT is a multi-stage tax on value addition, not solely on final consumption.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include mismatched pairs.


**3. With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                     Characteristic
1.  Commercial Paper                       :   A long-term instrument issued by the RBI to a corporation.
2.  Certificate of Deposit                  :   A short-term unsecured promissory note.
3.  Call Money                              :   Short-term finance used for interbank transactions.
4.  Zero-Coupon Bonds                     :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks.
5.  Masala Bonds                           :   Bonds issued outside India, denominated in Indian Rupees.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations, not the RBI. Certificates of deposit are short-term debt instruments issued by banks. Call money is indeed used for short-term interbank transactions. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; they are sold at a discount and mature at face value. Masala bonds are rupee-denominated bonds issued outside India. The other options incorrectly include mismatched pairs, reflecting a lack of understanding of these financial instruments.


**4. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Function                           Description
1.  Banker to Banks                       :   Lends funds to commercial banks in times of need.
2.  Issue of Currency                      :   Backed by assets, not necessarily gold.
3.  Management of Government Securities :   Manages and services both Central and State Government Securities.
4.  Monetary Policy                       :  Influenced by actions of the US Federal Reserve.
5.  Financial Inclusion                   :   Promoted through initiatives like the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched. The RBI acts as a banker to banks, providing liquidity support.  The RBI issues currency backed by assets. The RBI promotes financial inclusion through various initiatives, including NPCI.  However, the RBI primarily manages Central Government Securities; the management of State Government Securities is not a primary function.  While the US Federal Reserve's actions can indirectly influence RBI monetary policy, it's not a direct description of the RBI's monetary policy function. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include mismatched pairs.


**5.  With reference to government borrowing and debt, consider the following pairs:**

   Debt Instrument/Scheme                  Characteristic
1.  Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme        :   Provides long-term credit support for purchasing combine harvesters.
2.  Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme            :   Aimed at bringing idle gold lying with households into the economy.
3.  Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana           :   Provides loans to poor farmers for cultivating particular crops.
4.  External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs):  Can be in foreign currency or Indian rupee denominated.
5.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)          :   Provide protection to investors from uncertainty regarding inflation.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme aims to mobilize idle gold. ECBs can be raised in either foreign currency or Indian rupees. IIBs protect investors from inflation. KCC provides short-term credit, not long-term credit for major equipment. MUDRA Yojana focuses on small entrepreneurs, not specifically poor farmers for particular crops. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits correctly matched pairs. Options (c) and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of the schemes and instruments.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Scheme                     Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana       :   Providing loans to poor farmers for cultivating particular crops
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme        :   Promoting FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
3. Gold Monetization Scheme           :   To reduce India’s dependence on gold imports
4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme           :   Construction of family house and setting up of village cold storage facility

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) aims at bringing small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system, providing them with access to credit.  Option 1 incorrectly links MUDRA to agricultural loans; its focus is on micro and small enterprises. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme are designed to mobilize idle gold held by households, thereby reducing reliance on gold imports and boosting domestic resources. Option 2 incorrectly assigns FDI promotion as the primary objective of the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme; while it might indirectly contribute, its core goal is to bring gold into the economy. Option 3 correctly states that a key aim of the Gold Monetization Scheme is to reduce India's dependence on gold imports. Option 4 incorrectly links the Kisan Credit Card Scheme to housing and cold storage construction; this scheme primarily provides short-term credit support to farmers for working capital, purchase of inputs, and post-harvest expenses.  Therefore, only option (d) accurately reflects the primary objective of one of the schemes.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Banking Term                         Description
1. Merchant Discount Rate             :   The amount paid back by banks to their customers when they use debit cards for financial transactions
2. Legal Tender Money                  :   The bank money in the form of cheques, drafts, bills of exchange, etc.
3. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)       :   The amount that banks have to maintain in the form of their own funds to offset any loss that banks incur if the account-holders fail to repay dues
4. Money Multiplier                    :   Increases with an increase in the cash reserve ratio

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is the charge levied on a merchant by a bank for accepting payments through debit cards. Option 1 incorrectly describes MDR as a payback to customers; it is a fee paid by merchants. Legal tender money is the currency that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of debts. Option 2 incorrectly defines legal tender as bank money; it refers to government-issued currency. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is the minimum amount of capital that banks must hold to cover potential losses. Option 3 correctly defines CAR as a measure of a bank's ability to absorb losses. The money multiplier represents the potential expansion of money supply through fractional reserve banking. Option 4 incorrectly links the money multiplier to an increase in the cash reserve ratio; a higher CRR actually reduces the money multiplier. Thus, only option (c) presents a correct pairing.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                    Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                     :   A long-term instrument issued by the RBI to a corporation
2. Certificate of Deposit                  :   A short-term unsecured promissory note
3. Call Money                             :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks to corporations
4. Zero Coupon Bonds                    :   Short-term finance used for interbank transactions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds. Option 1 incorrectly describes it as a long-term RBI instrument. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term debt instruments issued by banks. Option 2 incorrectly labels it as a short-term unsecured promissory note; it's issued by banks, not corporations. Call money is short-term interbank lending. Option 3 incorrectly links call money to bonds issued by commercial banks to corporations. Zero-coupon bonds are debt instruments that do not pay periodic interest; instead, they are sold at a discount and mature at face value. Option 4 correctly describes the nature of zero-coupon bonds. Therefore, only option (d) contains a correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    RBI Action                                 Economic Situation
1. Buying government securities             :   Inflation is too high
2. Selling dollars in the market            :   Rupee is rapidly appreciating
3. Buying dollars                           :    Interest rates in the USA or European Union have risen

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

If inflation is too high, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to *sell* government securities to reduce the money supply, thereby curbing inflation. Option 1 incorrectly states that the RBI would buy securities in a high-inflation scenario. If the rupee is rapidly depreciating, the RBI is likely to sell dollars in the market to increase the supply of rupees and support the rupee's value. Option 2 correctly describes the RBI's response to a depreciating rupee. If interest rates in the USA or European Union rise, it would likely induce capital outflow from India, putting downward pressure on the rupee. In such a situation, the RBI might *sell*, not buy, dollars to manage the exchange rate. Option 3 incorrectly states that the RBI would buy dollars when international interest rates rise.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects one correctly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Government Expenditure        Description
1. Revenue Expenditure                  :  Acquiring new technology
2. Capital Expenditure                   :  Debt financing
3. Revenue Expenditure                  :   Equity financing

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Revenue expenditure is spending that does not create assets; it covers day-to-day operational expenses. Acquiring new technology is a capital expenditure as it creates an asset with a useful life exceeding one year. Option 1 incorrectly categorizes it as revenue expenditure. Debt financing and equity financing are methods of financing, not types of expenditure. Option 2 incorrectly pairs debt financing with capital expenditure; while debt can finance capital expenditure, the nature of the expenditure itself determines its classification. Similarly, equity financing can fund either revenue or capital expenditure. Option 3 incorrectly categorizes equity financing as revenue expenditure.  Therefore, only option (a) correctly identifies one matched pair.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                   Description
1.  Automatic Stabilizer                     :   Intense affirmative action by the Government to boost economic activity
2. Discretionary Fiscal Policy              :   Government policies that automatically adjust to changes in the economy
3. Ricardian Equivalence                    :   Government deficits do not affect aggregate demand

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

An automatic stabilizer is a feature of the government budget that automatically reduces fluctuations in the economy.  Option 1 incorrectly defines it as an intense government action; automatic stabilizers operate passively. Discretionary fiscal policy involves deliberate government actions to influence the economy.  Option 2 incorrectly describes it as policies adjusting automatically; it involves conscious policy decisions. Ricardian equivalence is a theory suggesting that government deficits do not stimulate aggregate demand because people anticipate future tax increases to pay off the debt. Option 3 correctly describes Ricardian equivalence. Therefore, only option (c) correctly matches a concept with its description.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fiscal Policy Measure                     Impact on Economy
1. Reduction in Fiscal Deficit             :  Increased private investment due to crowding out
2. Increase in Government Expenditure    :   Increased private investment during a recession (crowding in)
3. Counter-cyclical Fiscal Policy         :   Lower economic growth, higher output volatility, and higher inflation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A reduction in the fiscal deficit might lead to decreased government borrowing, potentially freeing up funds for the private sector and increasing private investment. However, this is not always guaranteed and depends on various factors. Option 1 incorrectly states that a fiscal deficit reduction leads to crowding out. Increased government expenditure can stimulate aggregate demand, potentially leading to increased private investment (crowding in) during a recession when there are idle resources. Option 2 correctly describes the crowding-in effect.  A counter-cyclical fiscal policy aims to stabilize the economy by offsetting economic cycles; it does not lead to lower growth, higher volatility, and higher inflation. Option 3 incorrectly attributes these negative impacts to counter-cyclical policy. Therefore, only option (b) contains one correctly matched pair.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Reform Measure                 Impact
1. Rupee devaluation (1991)               :   Decreased inflow of foreign exchange
2. Deregulation of Industrial Sector       :   Continued industrial licensing for all sectors
3. Financial Sector Reforms               :    Reduced the role of RBI from regulator to facilitator

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 1991 rupee devaluation aimed to increase the inflow of foreign exchange by making Indian exports more competitive. Option 1 incorrectly states that devaluation decreased foreign exchange inflow. The deregulation of the industrial sector involved abolishing industrial licensing for most sectors except a few specified ones. Option 2 is incorrect because it states that industrial licensing continued for all sectors. Financial sector reforms aimed at reducing the RBI's direct control, shifting its role from primarily a regulator to a facilitator. Option 3 correctly describes the impact of financial sector reforms.  Therefore, only option (c) correctly identifies one matched pair.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

  Reform Measure                            Objective
1. Removal of quantitative restrictions on imports: Protecting domestic industries
2. Reduction of tariff rates                 :  Reducing international competitiveness
3. Removal of licensing procedures for imports: Increasing efficiency and competitiveness

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The removal of quantitative restrictions (QRs) on imports was aimed at increasing competition and efficiency, not protecting domestic industries. Option 1 incorrectly pairs the removal of QRs with the objective of protecting domestic industries. Reducing tariff rates aims to increase international competitiveness by lowering the cost of imports and exports. Option 2 incorrectly links tariff reduction with reduced international competitiveness. The removal of licensing procedures for imports aimed to streamline trade and improve efficiency and competitiveness. Option 3 correctly matches the measure with its objective. Therefore, only option (c) contains one correctly matched pair.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

     Concept                                      Description
1.  Global Depository Receipts (GDRs)          :  Shares issued by an Indian company in the US representing ownership in an overseas depository bank
2. American Depository Receipts (ADRs)        :   Debt instruments raised by resident entities from non-resident entities
3. External Commercial Borrowing (ECBs)     :   Commercial loans raised by Indian companies listed and traded in the US

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) are instruments issued by a company in an international market, representing ownership of shares in that company. Option 1 correctly describes GDRs. American Depository Receipts (ADRs) are similar to GDRs but specifically represent shares traded in the US market. Option 2 incorrectly defines ADRs as debt instruments; they represent equity. External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) are loans raised by domestic entities from foreign sources. Option 3 correctly describes ECBs but is inaccurate in its additional detail about trading in the US.  Therefore, only options 1 and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. With reference to India's economic development, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                  Description
    1. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)       :   Calculated by comparing prices of a basket of goods across countries.
    2. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   An increase indicates rupee appreciation.
    3. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)  :    An increase indicates improved trade competitiveness.
    4. Consumer Price Index (CPI)           :   Weights food items higher than Wholesale Price Index (WPI).
    5. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)          :   Captures changes in service prices.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries to adjust for differences in purchasing power between currencies. This makes statement 1 correct.  An increase in NEER signifies that the rupee has appreciated against a basket of other currencies, hence statement 2 is also correct.  Statement 4 is correct as the CPI gives a higher weightage to food items compared to the WPI.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. An increase in REER indicates a *decline* in trade competitiveness because the domestic currency has become more expensive relative to other currencies, making exports more costly and imports cheaper. Statement 5 is also false; the WPI does *not* capture changes in service prices, which is a key feature of the CPI. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to macroeconomic indicators in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                   Characteristic
    1.  Tax revenue as % of GDP               :   Steadily increased in the last decade.
    2.  Fiscal deficit as % of GDP              :   Steadily increased in the last decade.
    3.  Capital budget of the Government of India: Includes loans received from foreign governments.
    4.  Capital budget of the Government of India: Includes loans and advances granted to States.
    5.  Goods and Services Tax (GST)           :   Drastically reduces India's current account deficit.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Neither tax revenue nor fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP steadily increased over the last decade; this makes statements 1 and 2 incorrect.  The capital budget of the Government of India does include both loans received from foreign governments and loans and advances granted to States and Union Territories; this makes statements 3 and 4 correct. The implementation of GST does not drastically reduce India's current account deficit; this makes statement 5 incorrect.  Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to fiscal policy and its impact, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Action                                    Effect
    1. Reducing revenue expenditure                  :   Reduces fiscal deficit.
    2. Introducing new welfare schemes                :   Increases fiscal deficit.
    3. Rationalizing subsidies                        :   Reduces fiscal deficit.
    4. Expanding industries                          :   May increase or decrease fiscal deficit depending on tax revenue generation.
    5.  Increase in real output growth by 3% points  :  Reduces fiscal deficit.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Reducing revenue expenditure directly decreases the government's spending, thus reducing the fiscal deficit. Rationalizing subsidies, by making them more efficient, also reduces government expenditure and the fiscal deficit.  A significant increase in real output growth (3% or more)  leads to higher tax revenues, enabling the government to reduce the fiscal deficit.  Introducing new welfare schemes typically increases government spending, leading to a higher fiscal deficit.  Expanding industries can have a mixed effect on the fiscal deficit, depending on whether the increased tax revenue from the expanded industries outweighs the increased government spending needed to support them. Therefore, only 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Indian banking system, consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                        Definition
    1.  Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)             :   Incentive given by a bank to a merchant for accepting debit card payments.
    2.  Legal tender money                        :   Money a creditor is compelled to accept for debt settlement.
    3.  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)             :   Amount banks maintain to offset losses from unpaid dues. Decided by each bank.
    4.  Money Multiplier                          :   Increases with an increase in the statutory liquidity ratio.
    5.  Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC)           :   Provides credit for consumption requirements of farm households and construction of family houses.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

MDR is a charge levied on merchants, not an incentive.  Legal tender money is correctly defined as the money that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in payment of a debt. CAR is the amount banks must maintain as capital to absorb potential losses, but it's set by regulatory bodies, not individual banks. The money multiplier increases with an increase in the banking habit of the population, not the statutory liquidity ratio. KCC does not provide credit for family house construction; hence only statement 2 is correct.


**5. With reference to financial instruments and policies, consider the following pairs:**

    Instrument/Policy                           Characteristic
    1.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)            :  Interest and capital gains are non-taxable.
    2.  Convertible Bonds                         :   Pay a higher rate of interest than non-convertible bonds.
    3.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)           :  Investment through capital instruments in listed companies.
    4.  Fiscal Stimulus                           :   Intense government action to boost economic activity.
    5.  Demand-pull inflation                     :  Caused by rising interest rates.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

IIBs do not have non-taxable interest and capital gains; hence statement 1 is incorrect. Convertible bonds pay a lower interest rate, not higher, because of the equity option.  FDI is not exclusively limited to listed companies. Fiscal stimulus is correctly defined. Demand-pull inflation is not caused by rising interest rates. Therefore only statement 4 is correctly matched.


**6. With reference to government budgeting and fiscal management in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                    Provision
    1.  Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM): Mandates elimination of revenue deficit by a specific date.
    2.  FRBM Act                                   :   Allows deviation from fiscal deficit targets exceeding 0.5% of GDP only for national security or natural calamity.
    3.  FRBM Act                                   :   Prohibits the Central Government from borrowing from the RBI except for temporary cash flow mismatches.
    4.  FRBM Act                                   :   Requires the RBI to subscribe to primary issues of central government securities annually.
    5.  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) :  Core of the core schemes for social protection.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The FRBM Act mandates the elimination of the revenue deficit, allows deviations from fiscal deficit targets under specific conditions, and prohibits borrowing from the RBI except for temporary purposes.  The RBI does not subscribe to primary issues of central government securities annually. PMGSY is not a core scheme for social protection.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Government Expenditure          Description
1. Revenue Expenditure                     :  Expenditure that does not create assets.
2. Capital Expenditure                      : Expenditure incurred for the normal functioning of government departments.
3. Plan Expenditure                         : Relates to central Plans (Five-Year Plans) and central assistance for State and Union Territory Plans.
4. Non-Plan Expenditure                    : Covers interest payments, defence, subsidies, salaries, and pensions.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Revenue expenditure is correctly defined as expenditure that does not create any physical or financial assets.  Plan expenditure accurately describes the budgetary allocation for central and state/UT development plans under the Five-Year Plan framework. Non-plan expenditure correctly encompasses a wide range of government services, including interest payments, defense, subsidies, salaries, and pensions.  Option 2 is incorrect because capital expenditure is defined as investment in assets like land, buildings, and machinery, not the running costs of government departments.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Understanding the distinction between revenue and capital expenditure is crucial for analyzing government budgets and fiscal policy.  The classification into plan and non-plan expenditure reflects India's planning process and the allocation of resources for development goals.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Government Deficit               Definition
1. Revenue Deficit                          : Excess of government’s revenue expenditure over revenue receipts.
2. Fiscal Deficit                            : Difference between government’s total expenditure and total receipts excluding borrowing.
3. Primary Deficit                           : Fiscal deficit minus net interest liabilities.
4. Effective Revenue Deficit                : Revenue deficit minus grants for capital asset creation by states.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  A revenue deficit arises when revenue expenditure exceeds revenue receipts, indicating the government is consuming more than it earns through revenue.  The fiscal deficit represents the total borrowing requirement of the government, highlighting the gap between total expenditure and total receipts (excluding borrowing). The primary deficit isolates the deficit excluding interest payments on accumulated debt, focusing on current fiscal imbalances.  Finally, the effective revenue deficit adjusts the revenue deficit by excluding grants used for capital asset creation by states, providing a more accurate picture of the government's revenue position.  Understanding these different deficit measures is essential for evaluating the government's fiscal health and policy choices.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Fiscal Policy Term             Meaning
1. Fiscal Stimulus                           : Intense affirmative action to boost economic activity.
2. Expansionary Fiscal Policy                : Increases government spending and reduces taxes to increase aggregate demand.
3. Contractionary Fiscal Policy               : Reduces government spending and increases taxes to reduce aggregate demand.
4. Counter-cyclical Fiscal Policy             : Fiscal measures to counter boom or recession, stabilizing the economy.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects the meaning of the given fiscal policy term. A fiscal stimulus is correctly defined as a government's intensive effort to stimulate economic activity. Expansionary fiscal policy accurately describes the strategy of increasing government spending and decreasing taxes to boost aggregate demand. Similarly, contractionary fiscal policy correctly refers to the opposite approach: reducing spending and raising taxes to curb aggregate demand. Lastly, counter-cyclical fiscal policy precisely describes the government's use of fiscal tools to counteract economic fluctuations (booms and recessions), aiming for stability.  These terms are fundamental to understanding macroeconomic management and government interventions in the economy.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                 Key Provision
1. Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 : Mandates reduction of fiscal and revenue deficits to achieve revenue surplus.
2. Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 : Prohibits borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) except for temporary cash flow issues.
3. Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 : Requires the submission of Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement, Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, and Macroeconomic Framework Statement to Parliament.
4. Goods and Services Tax (GST)                   : Replaced multiple taxes with a single market-based tax system.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect key provisions of the respective Acts. The FRBM Act, 2003, aimed at fiscal prudence and macroeconomic stability through deficit reduction and transparent fiscal management.  The Act's key provisions include the mandate for deficit reduction, restrictions on borrowing from the RBI, and the requirement for the submission of various fiscal policy statements to Parliament. The GST, a significant tax reform, consolidated multiple indirect taxes into a single, unified system, fostering a more efficient and integrated national market.  Understanding these legislative frameworks is critical for analyzing India's fiscal policies and economic reforms.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Subsidy                                    Characteristic
1. Price Subsidy                                   :  Direct payment to producers.
2. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)                     : Transfers money directly to beneficiaries' accounts.
3. Income Support                                  : Does not distort market prices.
4. Consumer Subsidy                                : Provided to consumers for specified goods and services.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is characterized by direct cash transfers to beneficiaries' accounts, eliminating leakages and inefficiencies associated with traditional price subsidies. Income support, unlike price subsidies or DBT, doesn't affect market prices because it provides unconditional cash transfers without requiring specific purchases. Consumer subsidies are targeted at providing benefits to consumers for specific goods and services (e.g., LPG).  Pair 1 is incorrect; while price subsidies *can* involve payments to producers (like Minimum Support Price for farmers), it's not the defining characteristic.  Price subsidies are often implemented through below-market pricing of goods and services.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Understanding the different types of subsidies and their characteristics is crucial for analyzing their impact on the economy and welfare.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fiscal Term                     Definition
1. Revenue Deficit                 Excess of total expenditure over total receipts
2. Fiscal Deficit                   Excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts
3. Primary Deficit                  Fiscal deficit minus interest payments
4. Budget Deficit                   Excess of total expenditure over total receipts excluding borrowings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the definition of Primary Deficit is correctly matched.  A revenue deficit is the excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts.  A fiscal deficit represents the difference between the government's total expenditure and its total receipts excluding borrowings.  A budget deficit is the excess of total expenditure over total receipts. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the definitions of at least one of the fiscal terms.  The correct understanding of these deficits is crucial for analyzing a government's fiscal health and policy choices.  Revenue deficit indicates unsustainable consumption expenditure, while fiscal deficit shows the total borrowing requirement. The primary deficit isolates the impact of current spending decisions, excluding interest payments on past debts.


**2. With reference to the Indian Fiscal System, consider the following pairs:**

   Fund                                   Description
1. Consolidated Fund of India             Receipts from the sale of Savings Certificates
2. Contingency Fund of India             Used to meet unforeseen expenses pending parliamentary authorization
3. Public Account of India                 All revenues received by the government from taxes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Contingency Fund of India is indeed used to meet unforeseen expenses before parliamentary approval.  Pair 1 is incorrect; receipts from the sale of Savings Certificates are credited to the Public Account of India, not the Consolidated Fund. Pair 3 is also incorrect; all revenues received by the government from taxes are credited to the Consolidated Fund, not the Public Account. The distinction between these funds is critical to understanding India's budgetary system. The Consolidated Fund holds the government's primary revenue, the Contingency Fund handles emergencies, and the Public Account manages other public monies.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Government Expenditure       Description
1. Revenue Expenditure                 Expenditure on acquisition of land
2. Capital Expenditure                   Interest payments on government debt
3. Revenue Expenditure                 Grants given to state governments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Revenue expenditure includes expenses that do not create assets or reduce liabilities, such as grants to states and interest payments. Capital expenditure involves investments that create assets or reduce liabilities, such as the acquisition of land.  Therefore, option (a) is partially correct, but option (c) is the most appropriate as it includes both correctly matched pairs.  Understanding this classification is vital for analyzing government spending priorities and its impact on the economy. Revenue expenditure reflects the government's operational costs, while capital expenditure represents investments in future productivity.


**4. With reference to the Indian Budgetary Process, consider the following pairs:**

   Budget Type                          Characteristic
1. Full Budget                          Covers only a part of the financial year
2. Interim Budget                       Complete set of accounts for a part of the year
3. Vote-on-Account                     Deals only with expenditure

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. An interim budget provides a complete financial statement for a portion of the year, typically during election years. A vote-on-account addresses only the expenditure side of the budget, providing temporary funding until the full budget is approved.  Pair 1 is incorrect because a full budget covers the entire financial year.  This understanding of different budget types is crucial for comprehending the flexibility and constraints within the Indian budgetary framework.  The different budget types reflect the government's need to balance immediate financial needs with long-term planning and political considerations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Fiscal Deficit Measure              Description
1. Revenue Deficit                     Total borrowing requirements of the government
2. Fiscal Deficit                        Excess of government revenue expenditure over revenue receipts
3. Primary Deficit                       Fiscal deficit minus net interest payments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The primary deficit accurately reflects the fiscal deficit after removing net interest liabilities.  Pair 1 is incorrect; a revenue deficit refers to the excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts, not total borrowing. Pair 2 is incorrect; the fiscal deficit signifies the difference between total expenditure and total receipts (excluding borrowings), not just the excess of revenue expenditure over receipts.  Understanding these deficits is essential for evaluating government fiscal policies and their impact on the economy's stability and growth trajectory.  The distinction helps assess whether borrowing is for investment or consumption, impacting long-term sustainability.


**6. With reference to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                   Objective
1.  Reduction in fiscal deficit                 Inter-generational equity
2.  Elimination of revenue deficit            Long-term macroeconomic stability
3.  Restriction on borrowing from RBI       Effective debt management

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The FRBM Act aims to achieve inter-generational equity, long-term macroeconomic stability, and effective debt management through specific measures.  Reducing the fiscal deficit and eliminating the revenue deficit contribute to long-term fiscal sustainability and inter-generational equity by ensuring that future generations are not burdened by excessive debt.  Restricting borrowing from the RBI helps in controlling money supply and inflation, directly related to macroeconomic stability and responsible debt management.  The FRBM Act's provisions are designed to ensure fiscal prudence and long-term economic health.  The Act's success depends on consistent implementation and adherence to its principles.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax Type                                 Characteristic
1. Progressive Tax                          Tax percentage decreases with income increase
2. Proportional Tax                        Tax percentage remains constant regardless of income
3. Regressive Tax                           Tax percentage increases with income increase

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. A proportional tax system levies a constant percentage of income regardless of the income level. Pair 1 is incorrect because a progressive tax system increases the tax percentage as income increases. Pair 3 is incorrect because a regressive tax system decreases the tax percentage as income increases. Understanding the different tax systems is crucial for analyzing their distributional impact and their role in achieving social and economic objectives.  Progressive taxes aim for equity, while regressive taxes disproportionately affect lower-income groups.


**8. With reference to the distribution of tax proceeds between the Centre and States in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                  Description
1. Vertical Devolution                     Allocation of shared proceeds among states
2. Horizontal Devolution                  Distribution of net tax proceeds between Centre and states
3. Grants-in-aid                           Financial assistance from the Consolidated Fund of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Vertical devolution refers to the sharing of tax proceeds between the Centre and the States, while horizontal devolution involves the allocation of those shared proceeds among the States. Grants-in-aid represent financial assistance from the Consolidated Fund of India to the States.  Pair 1 is incorrect because it misrepresents the definition of vertical devolution.  The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in determining these distributions, aiming to balance the fiscal needs of both the Centre and the States and to address inter-state disparities.  The principles guiding these allocations are crucial for maintaining federal fiscal balance.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Deficit Measure            Calculation
1. Revenue Deficit                       Revenue Expenditure - Revenue Receipts
2. Fiscal Deficit                          Total Expenditure - (Revenue Receipts + Non-debt creating capital receipts)
3. Primary Deficit                        Gross Fiscal Deficit - Net Interest Liabilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The calculations for revenue deficit, fiscal deficit, and primary deficit are accurately represented. The revenue deficit shows the difference between revenue expenditure and revenue receipts. The fiscal deficit indicates the total borrowing requirement of the government, calculated by subtracting revenue and non-debt creating capital receipts from total expenditure.  The primary deficit isolates the impact of current spending decisions, excluding interest payments on past debts.  These measures are fundamental for assessing the government's fiscal health and its impact on the economy.  Their accurate calculation is essential for sound economic policy-making.


**10. With reference to  the components of India's Union Budget, consider the following pairs:**

   Document                                 Purpose
1. Annual Financial Statement             Details of taxation proposals
2. Demand for Grants                       Authorizes government expenditure
3. Appropriation Bill                       Government's estimate of expenditure and receipts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Demand for Grants outlines the government's proposed expenditure for various ministries and departments, which is then voted upon by the Parliament to authorize the spending.  Pair 1 is incorrect because the Annual Financial Statement presents the government's overall financial position, while the Finance Bill details the taxation proposals. Pair 3 is incorrect because the Appropriation Bill is what authorizes the government expenditure, not the Annual Financial Statement.  These documents are integral to the budgetary process, detailing the government's revenue projections, expenditure plans, and taxation policies.  Understanding their roles is essential to grasping the structure and functioning of the Indian budget.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fund                                         Source of Funding
1.  State Disaster Risk Management Fund      :   Entirely from State Government Budgetary Resources
2.  State Disaster Response Fund              :   75% from Centre, 25% from States (90:10 for NE States)
3.  State Disaster Mitigation Fund            :   25% from Centre, 75% from States (10:90 for NE States)
4.  Rashtriya Suraksha Naivedyam Kosh      :   Disinvestment proceeds of DPSEs only
5.  GST Compensation Fund                   :   Proceeds from GST Compensation Cess

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The State Disaster Risk Management Fund (SDRMF) is subdivided into the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and the State Disaster Mitigation Fund (SDMF).  The XV Finance Commission recommended a 75:25 ratio of funding for SDRMF between the Centre and States (with a 90:10 ratio for Northeast states).  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.  Pair 3 is incorrect because it reverses the contribution ratio.  The Rashtriya Suraksha Naivedyam Kosh receives funding from multiple sources, including transfers from the Consolidated Fund of India, disinvestment proceeds, monetization of defence land, and future receipts from land transfers. Pair 4 is incorrect as it only mentions one of the several sources. The GST Compensation Fund is indeed funded by the GST Compensation Cess, making pair 5 correct.  Pair 1 is entirely incorrect as SDRMF receives funding from both the Centre and the States.


**2. With reference to the distribution of tax revenue, consider the following pairs:**

   Parameter                                   Weightage in Horizontal Devolution
1.  Income Distance                           :   20%
2.  Population (2011 Census)                 :   45%
3.  Demographic Performance                   :   12.5%
4.  State Area                                 :   15%
5.  Tax and fiscal effort                      :   10%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The XV Finance Commission's horizontal devolution parameters and their weightages are as follows: Income Distance (45%), Population (2011 Census) (15%), Demographic Performance (12.5%), State Area (15%), Forest and Ecology (10%), and Tax and fiscal effort (2.5%).  Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because the weightage for Income Distance is 45%, not 20%.  Pair 2 is incorrect because the weightage for Population is 15%, not 45%. Pair 5 is also incorrect as the weightage for Tax and fiscal effort is 2.5%, not 10%.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Grant-in-Aid                       Characteristic
1. Revenue Deficit Grants                     :   Tied grants charged on the Consolidated Fund of India
2. Local Body Grants                         :   60% earmarked for national priorities, 40% untied
3. Disaster Management Grants                :   100% funding from Union Government for all states.
4. Sector Specific Grants                     :   Always untied grants.
5. State Specific Grants                      :   Formula-based devolution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Revenue Deficit Grants are tied grants charged on the Consolidated Fund of India, making pair 1 correct. Local Body Grants indeed have a 60:40 split between earmarked and untied funds, correctly matching pair 2.  Pair 3 is incorrect because Disaster Management Grants have a 75:25 Centre-State funding ratio (90:10 for Northeast states), not 100% from the Centre.  Sector Specific Grants can be performance-based incentives or tied grants, contradicting pair 4.  State Specific Grants are tied, not formula-based, thus making pair 5 incorrect.


**4. With reference to the Consolidated Fund of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Item                                         Inclusion/Exclusion from Divisible Pool
1.  Cost of collection of taxes                 :   Included
2.  Cess and Surcharge                         :   Included
3.  Tax Revenue of the Union Territories       :   Excluded
4.  National Calamity Contingency Duty         :   Excluded
5. Grants-in-Aid                               : Included


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The divisible pool of Central taxes excludes the cost of tax collection, cess and surcharge, tax revenue of Union Territories, and National Calamity Contingency Duty.  Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Pairs 1, 2, and 5 are incorrect because these items are excluded from the divisible pool.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme Category                             Example Scheme
1. Core Schemes                               :   MGNREGA
2. Core of the Core Schemes                   :   Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
3. Optional Schemes                           :   Namami Gange

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The categorization of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) by the NITI Aayog sub-group includes Core Schemes (focus on National Development Agenda, Centre and States collaborate), Core of the Core Schemes (social protection and inclusion, first charge on funds), and Optional Schemes (States choose, lump-sum allocation).  MGNREGA falls under the 'Core of the Core' category, making pair 1 incorrect. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana is a Core Scheme, making pair 2 incorrect.  Namami Gange is a Central Sector Scheme (CSS), not a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to the Indian Budget, consider the following pairs:**

   Budget Component                          Description
1. Revenue Budget                             :   Includes loans received from foreign governments
2. Capital Budget                             :   Includes expenditure on acquisition of assets
3. Revenue Expenditure                        :   Includes interest payments on government debt
4. Capital Expenditure                         :   Includes loans and advances granted to States
5. Revenue Deficit                             :   Excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Capital Budget includes expenditure on acquiring assets (pair 2), and Revenue Expenditure includes interest payments on government debt (pair 3). The Revenue Deficit is indeed the excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts (pair 5). Loans received from foreign governments are considered capital receipts, making pair 1 incorrect.  Loans and advances granted to states are considered capital expenditure, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax                                         Nature of Tax
1. Corporation Tax                            :   Indirect Tax
2. Customs Duty                               :   Indirect Tax
3. Wealth Tax                                 :   Direct Tax
4. Excise Duty                                :   Indirect Tax
5.  Goods and Services Tax (GST)              :   Direct Tax


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Customs Duty, Excise Duty, and GST are indirect taxes. Wealth Tax is a direct tax. Corporation Tax is a direct tax levied on the profits of companies.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA), 2003, consider the following pairs:**

   Mandate                                    Detail
1. Eliminate revenue deficit                   :   By March 31, 2009
2. Reduce fiscal deficit                       :   By 0.5% of GDP each year
3.  Borrowing from RBI                         :   Allowed only for temporary cash flow mismatches
4.  Transparency in fiscal operations          :   Mandated through quarterly review of receipts and expenditure
5.  Statements to Parliament                   :   Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The FRBMA, 2003, mandated the elimination of the revenue deficit by March 31, 2009 (pair 1). It also restricted borrowing from the RBI to temporary cash flow mismatches (pair 3) and emphasized transparency through quarterly reviews (pair 4).  The fiscal deficit reduction target was 0.3% of GDP annually, not 0.5% (pair 2). The FRBMA mandates the submission of three statements to Parliament: Medium-term Fiscal Policy Statement, Fiscal Policy Strategy Statement, and Macroeconomic Framework Statement (pair 5).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax/Receipt Source                      Government Level
1. Customs Duties                          :   State Government
2. Corporation Tax                         :   Union Government
3. Sales Tax                               :   Union Government
4. Gift Tax                                 :   State Government
5. Land Revenue                            :   Union Government

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only Corporation Tax is exclusively a Union Government tax.  Customs duties are levied by the Union Government. Sales tax, now subsumed under GST, was previously levied by both the Union and State Governments. Gift tax and Land Revenue are primarily State Government tax sources, though the Union Government might also levy some related taxes. Option (b) correctly identifies the only exclusively Union Government tax source from the list. The other options incorrectly include tax sources that are either shared between the Union and State governments or primarily levied at the State level, showcasing a common misconception regarding the division of tax powers in the Indian federal system.  Understanding the division of tax powers between the Union and State governments is crucial for analyzing India's fiscal federalism and the distribution of resources.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Concept                     Description
1. Revenue Deficit                       :   Always lower than Fiscal Deficit
2. Fiscal Deficit                         :   Includes Revenue Deficit and Capital Expenditure
3. Capital Gains                          :   Increase in sales of a product
4. Consolidated Fund of India             :   Receipts credited after authorization from the President
5. Public Account                         :   All revenues of the Union Government are credited here

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A revenue deficit occurs when government revenue falls short of its expenditure on revenue accounts.  A fiscal deficit is the difference between the government's total expenditure and its total receipts (excluding borrowings). Revenue deficit is always a component of fiscal deficit. Capital gains arise from an increase in the value of an asset, not necessarily from sales. The Consolidated Fund of India requires parliamentary authorization for withdrawals, not presidential. All revenues received by the Union Government are credited to the Consolidated Fund of India, not the Public Account. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 accurately describe the given financial concepts. This question tests the understanding of fundamental fiscal concepts and their interrelationships, which is vital for comprehending government budgeting and financial management in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Grant-in-Aid                  Source & Nature
1. Revenue Deficit Grants                :   Charged on Consolidated Fund of India, Untied
2. Local Body Grants                    :   Allocated based on 90% population and 10% area
3. Disaster Management Grants           :   75% Centre, 25% States (90:10 for NE)
4. Sector Specific Grants                :   Always performance-based incentives
5. State Specific Grants                  :   Formula-based devolution, covering cost disabilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Revenue deficit grants are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and are provided to states to address revenue shortfalls post-devolution. Local body grants are allocated considering population (90%) and area (10%). Disaster management grants are shared between the Centre and States in a specified ratio. However, not all sector-specific grants are performance-based; some are simply grants. State-specific grants address unique state needs not covered by formula-based devolution.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly exclude or include pairs that misrepresent the nature or source of these grants. This question evaluates the knowledge of the intricacies of the Indian fiscal federal system, including the different types of grants-in-aid and their allocation mechanisms.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tax Type                                 Characteristic
1. Progressive Tax                          :   Tax rate increases with income level
2. Proportional Tax                         :   Tax rate is constant irrespective of income
3. Regressive Tax                           :   Higher tax burden on lower-income groups
4. Direct Tax                               :   Collected by State Governments
5. Indirect Tax                             :   Does not directly increase commodity price

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A progressive tax system features higher tax rates for higher income levels.  A proportional tax system imposes a constant tax rate regardless of income. A regressive tax system disproportionately burdens lower-income groups. Direct taxes are levied directly on income or wealth, and are collected by the central government. Indirect taxes are levied on goods and services, increasing their prices.  Option (a) correctly matches the characteristics of progressive, proportional, and regressive taxes. Option (d) incorrectly includes only the correct matching of progressive and regressive taxes. Options (b) and (c) are incorrect as they exclude the correct matching of regressive taxes. This question tests the understanding of different types of tax systems and their impact on various income groups, a crucial aspect of public finance.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Statement                                  Truth Value regarding Income Tax in India
1. It is a progressive tax                   :   True
2. It is a direct tax                         :   True
3. It is collected by State Governments     :   False
4. It is a proportional tax                  :   False
5. It is collected by the Union Government :   True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian income tax system is progressive, meaning higher earners pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes. It's a direct tax, levied directly on the income of individuals and corporations. It is collected by the Union Government, not State Governments. It is not a proportional tax; the tax rate varies with income levels.  Option (a) correctly identifies the true and false statements.  Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the nature of income tax in India. This question tests the understanding of the characteristics of the Indian income tax system and its place within the broader tax structure.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Component of Divisible Pool of Central Taxes     Inclusion/Exclusion
1. Cost of collection of taxes                       :   Included
2. Cess and Surcharge                             :   Excluded
3. Tax Revenue of the Union Territories                :   Excluded
4. National Calamity Contingency Duty                 :   Excluded
5.  41% of central taxes                             :   Included

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The divisible pool of central taxes excludes the cost of tax collection, cess and surcharge, and tax revenue of Union Territories.  The National Calamity Contingency Duty is also excluded.  The 41% share of central taxes is indeed part of the divisible pool.  Option (b) correctly identifies all the inclusions and exclusions. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include or exclude elements of the divisible pool. This question tests understanding of the composition of the divisible pool of central taxes, a key aspect of India's fiscal federalism.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parameter for Horizontal Distribution of Taxes      Weight Assigned by XV Finance Commission
1. Income Distance                                   :    45%
2. Population (2011 Census)                         :    15%
3. Demographic Performance                           :    12.5%
4. State Area                                        :    10%
5. Forest and Ecology                               :    15%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The XV Finance Commission assigned weights to various parameters for horizontal devolution. Income distance received a 45% weight, population (2011 Census) 15%, demographic performance 12.5%, state area 15%, and forest and ecology 10%. Option (c) correctly matches three of the parameters with their assigned weights. Options (a), (b), and (d) either include incorrect weight assignments or incorrectly include or exclude parameters.  This question tests the knowledge of the specific parameters and their weights used in the horizontal distribution of taxes among states, demonstrating an understanding of the intricacies of India's fiscal federalism.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Source of Funding for Rashtriya Suraksha Naivedyam Kosh   Nature of Source
1. Transfers from the Consolidated Fund of India              :   Incremental Funding
2. Disinvestment proceeds of DPSEs                         :   Non-Incremental Funding
3. Proceeds from monetisation of surplus defence land        :   One-time Funding
4. Proceeds of receipts from defence land transferred to States :   Recurring Funding


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Rashtriya Suraksha Naivedyam Kosh (or similar fund) is proposed to receive funds from various sources.  Transfers from the Consolidated Fund of India represent incremental funding, added to the fund regularly.  Disinvestment proceeds and proceeds from monetization of land are more likely to be one-time or non-recurring sources.  Proceeds from land transferred to states are also likely to be non-recurring.  Therefore, only pair 1 correctly matches the source with the nature of funding.  The other options incorrectly classify the nature of the funding sources.  This question tests an understanding of the financial mechanisms proposed for strengthening national security, demonstrating knowledge of government budgeting and resource allocation.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Category of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)     Example Scheme
1. Core Schemes                                      :   MGNREGA
2. Core of the Core Schemes                           :   Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
3. Optional Schemes                                  :   National Food Security Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The categorization of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) involves core schemes focusing on national development, core-of-core schemes prioritizing social protection, and optional schemes allowing state choice.  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a core scheme, while MGNREGA is often considered a core-of-core scheme.  The National Food Security Act is not typically classified as a CSS. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly assign schemes to categories. This question tests the understanding of the rationalization of centrally sponsored schemes, reflecting knowledge of government policy and planning.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM)         Description
1. Revenue Deficit Elimination Target                     :   March 31, 2009
2. Fiscal Deficit Reduction Target per year                 :   0.3% of GDP
3. Borrowing from RBI                                      :   Allowed only for temporary cash flow issues
4.  RBI Subscription to Primary Issues of Government Securities:   Allowed without any restrictions
5. Quarterly Review of Receipts and Expenditure          :   Presented to Parliament


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The FRBM Act mandates specific targets and rules for fiscal management. The Act aimed to eliminate the revenue deficit by March 31, 2009, and reduce the fiscal deficit by 0.3% of GDP annually. Borrowing from the RBI is permitted only to address temporary cash flow mismatches. The RBI's subscription to primary issues of government securities is restricted under the act. Quarterly reviews of receipts and expenditure are presented to Parliament.  Option (d) correctly matches these features with their descriptions. Other options incorrectly include or exclude aspects of the FRBM Act.  This question assesses knowledge of the key provisions of the FRBM Act and its impact on fiscal management in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax/Levy                                 Characteristic
1.  Central Sales Tax (CST)                 :   Levied by the Centre on interstate sales, proceeds kept by origin state
2.  Value Added Tax (VAT)                 :   Multi-point, destination-based tax levied on value addition at each stage
3.  Entry Tax                               :   Imposed by recipient states on interstate movement of goods
4.  Stamp Duty                             :   Tax on legal property transactions, rate varies by state

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Central Sales Tax (CST) was a tax levied by the central government on the sale of goods between states, but the revenue was collected and retained by the state where the goods originated.  Value Added Tax (VAT) is a multi-point, destination-based tax system where the tax is levied on the value added at each stage of the production and distribution chain.  Entry tax was a tax levied by receiving states on goods entering their territory from other states, aiming to protect their own tax base. Finally, Stamp Duty is a tax imposed on legal documents related to property transactions, and its rate is determined at the state level, resulting in variations across different states.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Subsidy Type                          Example
1.  Consumer Benefit, Direct Subsidy      :  LPG price subsidy before DBT
2.  Producer Benefit, Indirect Subsidy    :  Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers
3.  Explicit Subsidy, Fuel                 :  Kerosene subsidy (before its phase-out)
4.  Implicit Subsidy, Social Service       :  Subsidized healthcare in government hospitals

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the types and examples of subsidies.  LPG price subsidies before the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system directly benefited consumers.  MSP for farmers is an indirect subsidy benefiting producers.  Kerosene subsidies were explicit and focused on fuel. Subsidized healthcare in government hospitals represents an implicit subsidy for a social service. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and exclude correctly matched pairs.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Land Reform Measure                     Description
1. Abolition of Intermediaries             :  Eliminated the role of zamindars and other intermediaries in land revenue collection
2. Tenancy Reforms                         :  Aimed at regulating the relationship between landlords and tenants, often including rent control and security of tenure for tenants.
3.  Land Ceiling Acts                      :  Set limits on the maximum amount of land an individual or family could own
4.  Consolidation of Holdings            :  Combined fragmented landholdings into larger, more efficient units.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately represent major land reform measures implemented post-independence in India.  Abolition of intermediaries aimed to remove the layer of revenue collectors between the cultivator and the state. Tenancy reforms focused on improving the rights and security of tenants. Land ceiling acts aimed to redistribute land ownership by limiting the maximum landholding size. Consolidation of holdings aimed at improving agricultural efficiency by combining fragmented plots.  Therefore, option (d) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.


**4. With reference to the Indian Fiscal System, consider the following pairs:**

   Budget Component                       Item Included
1. Revenue Budget                          :  Expenditure on salaries of government employees
2. Capital Budget                           :  Loans received from foreign governments
3.  Divisible Pool of Central Taxes        :  Includes cess and surcharge
4.  Consolidated Fund of India              :  All revenues received by the Union Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Revenue budget includes routine government spending like salaries. Capital budget includes borrowing and loan repayments.  The Consolidated Fund of India houses all government revenues. However, pair 3 is incorrect. The divisible pool of central taxes *excludes* cess and surcharge. These are specifically excluded from the shareable tax revenue between the Centre and States. Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.


**5. With reference to the Finance Commission's recommendations, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Transfer                           Characteristic
1.  Vertical Devolution                      :  Percentage share of central taxes distributed among states
2.  Grants-in-Aid (Article 275)             :  Includes revenue deficit grants and local body grants
3.  Post-Devolution Revenue Deficit Grants :  Aimed at correcting deficiencies in fiscal capacity of states
4.  Local Body Grants                       :   Distribution among states weighted by population and area


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Vertical devolution refers to the share of central taxes devolved to states. Grants-in-aid under Article 275 include various types, such as revenue deficit grants and local body grants. Post-devolution revenue deficit grants aim to address revenue shortfalls in states after the devolution of central taxes. Local body grants are distributed among states considering factors like population and area. Therefore, option (d) is correct. Other options are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**6. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                    Description
1.  CGST                                      :  Central Goods and Services Tax, levied by the Centre
2.  SGST                                      :  State Goods and Services Tax, levied by the states
3.  IGST                                      :  Integrated Goods and Services Tax, levied on interstate transactions
4.  Composition Levy                          :  Alternative tax method for small businesses with turnover below a certain limit


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately describe GST concepts. CGST is the tax levied by the central government, SGST is levied by state governments, IGST is levied on interstate supplies, and a composition levy is an optional simplified tax system for small businesses.  Therefore, option (d) is correct.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, excluding correctly matched pairs.  Understanding these components is crucial for comprehending the structure and functioning of the GST system in India.


**7. With reference to government expenditure, consider the following pairs:**

   Expenditure Type                         Example
1. Revenue Expenditure                      :  Payment of salaries to government employees
2. Capital Expenditure                      :  Acquisition of new technology for a government department
3.  Plan Expenditure                        :  Expenditure on infrastructure projects as outlined in a five-year plan
4.  Non-Plan Expenditure                   :  Routine administrative expenses of government departments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Revenue expenditure is the recurring expenditure of the government, such as salaries.  Capital expenditure involves spending on assets that have a long-term value, such as acquiring new technology.  Plan expenditure refers to spending on projects outlined in the government's five-year plans. Non-plan expenditure covers routine administrative expenses.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as all the pairs are correctly matched.


**8.  With reference to government debt, consider the following pairs:**

   Debt Characteristic                      Description
1. Internal Debt                             :  Government borrowing from domestic sources like banks and individuals
2. External Debt                            :  Government borrowing from foreign sources like international financial institutions
3.  Domestic Liabilities                     :  Includes dated securities issued at market-related rates in auctions
4.  Fiscal Deficit                           :  Difference between government's total expenditure and total receipts excluding borrowings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Internal debt represents borrowing within the country, external debt from foreign sources, and domestic liabilities include various instruments like dated securities. However, pair 4 is incorrect. A fiscal deficit is the difference between total expenditure and total receipts, *including* borrowings.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.  Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrectly matched pair.



**9. With reference to macroeconomic indicators, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                 Description
1. Nominal GDP                              :  Value of GDP at current market prices
2. Real GDP                                 :  Value of GDP adjusted for inflation, using constant prices
3.  GDP Deflator                            :  Ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP, reflecting price changes
4.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)              :  Index of prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by a representative consumer


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Nominal GDP is calculated at current prices, real GDP adjusts for inflation, the GDP deflator measures price changes using the ratio of nominal to real GDP, and CPI tracks the price changes of a consumer basket. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. All other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  These indicators are essential tools for economic analysis and policymaking.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fiscal Policy Instrument                  Effect
1. Increase in Government Expenditure     :  Increases aggregate demand
2. Decrease in Taxes                       :  Increases disposable income
3.  Increase in Transfer Payments          :  Increases disposable income, but less than an equal increase in government expenditure
4. Balanced Budget Multiplier              :  A one-to-one increase in output for equal increases in government spending and taxes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly describe the effects of fiscal policy instruments. Increasing government expenditure directly boosts aggregate demand.  Tax cuts increase disposable income, leading to higher consumption.  Increasing transfers also raises disposable income but less so than an equivalent rise in government spending due to saving. The balanced budget multiplier shows that a simultaneous equal increase in government spending and taxes leads to a one-to-one increase in output. Therefore, option (d) is correct.  All other options are incomplete.  Understanding these relationships is fundamental to analyzing the impact of fiscal policy on the economy.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fiscal Policy Term                     Definition/Description
1. Revenue Deficit                       : Excess of government's revenue expenditure over revenue receipts.
2. Fiscal Deficit                         : Difference between government's total expenditure and total receipts excluding borrowing.
3. Primary Deficit                       : Fiscal deficit minus net interest liabilities.
4.  Effective Revenue Deficit            : Revenue deficit minus grants for creation of capital assets.
5.  Effective Capital Expenditure       : Capital expenditure plus grants for creation of capital assets.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The definitions provided accurately reflect the standard macroeconomic concepts related to government budgeting and fiscal policy.

* **Revenue Deficit:** This accurately captures the shortfall between a government's income from taxes and other revenue sources and its spending on day-to-day operations.  A persistent revenue deficit indicates unsustainable fiscal practices.

* **Fiscal Deficit:**  This correctly describes the overall borrowing requirement of the government, reflecting the difference between total spending (including capital investments) and total revenue (excluding borrowings).  A high fiscal deficit can raise concerns about debt sustainability.

* **Primary Deficit:** This correctly identifies the deficit excluding interest payments on existing debt.  Analyzing the primary deficit helps assess the government's ability to manage its current spending without relying heavily on borrowing to cover interest payments.

* **Effective Revenue Deficit:** This nuanced measure adjusts the revenue deficit by excluding grants used for capital asset creation. This provides a more accurate picture of the government's consumption-related fiscal imbalance.

* **Effective Capital Expenditure:** This measure similarly adjusts capital expenditure by including grants used for capital asset creation, offering a comprehensive view of government investment.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs.  Understanding these fiscal deficit measures is crucial for analyzing a government's fiscal health and its impact on the economy.  The inclusion of "effective" revenue deficit and capital expenditure demonstrates a deeper understanding of fiscal accounting and policy.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Budget Component           Description
1. Revenue Budget                          :  Statement of government's current financial needs.
2. Capital Budget                          : Account of government's assets and liabilities, considering changes in capital.
3. Plan Expenditure                        : Expenditure related to Five-Year Plans and central assistance for state plans.
4. Non-Plan Expenditure                    : Expenditure covering general, economic, and social services.
5. Capital Receipts                         : Loans raised by the government, borrowing from banks, and proceeds from PSU share sales.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately describe the components of a government budget. The distinctions between revenue and capital accounts, plan and non-plan expenditures, and the sources of capital receipts are fundamental to understanding government fiscal management.

* **Revenue Budget:** This focuses on the government's recurrent income and expenditure, reflecting its day-to-day operations and short-term financial needs.

* **Capital Budget:** This deals with long-term investments and financing, including government borrowing and asset acquisition.  It reflects the government's investment in the country's capital stock.

* **Plan Expenditure:** This component is directly linked to the government's development plans and reflects its strategic investments in various sectors.

* **Non-Plan Expenditure:** This encompasses a broader range of government spending, including essential services and administrative functions.

* **Capital Receipts:**  This correctly outlines the various ways the government raises capital for investment, including market borrowings, loans from financial institutions, and disinvestment proceeds.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect, as they fail to include all the correctly matched pairs.  A comprehensive understanding of these budget components is essential for evaluating government fiscal policies and their impact on economic growth and development.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) Feature     Description
1. Revenue Deficit Target                  : Elimination by March 31, 2009.
2. Fiscal Deficit Reduction Target         : 0.3% of GDP reduction annually.
3. Borrowing from RBI                      : Prohibited except for temporary cash flow mismatches.
4. Transparency Measures                  : Greater transparency in fiscal operations.
5. Quarterly Review of Receipts and Expenditure  : Review to be presented to Parliament.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FRBM Act of 2003 aimed to improve India's fiscal management through various measures.  All five pairs correctly represent key features of the Act.

* **Revenue Deficit Target:** The Act initially aimed to eliminate the revenue deficit, a significant indicator of fiscal sustainability, by a specific deadline.

* **Fiscal Deficit Reduction Target:**  The Act mandated a phased reduction in the fiscal deficit, indicating a commitment to fiscal consolidation.

* **Borrowing from RBI:** The Act restricted the government's reliance on borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India, aiming to reduce monetary policy distortions.

* **Transparency Measures:** The Act emphasized transparency in government fiscal operations, promoting accountability and better public understanding of government finances.

* **Quarterly Review of Receipts and Expenditure:** The Act required regular parliamentary review of fiscal performance, enhancing oversight and ensuring adherence to targets.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs. The FRBM Act represents a significant reform in Indian fiscal policy, and understanding its key features is crucial for evaluating the government's fiscal performance and its impact on the economy.  The Act's provisions on transparency and parliamentary oversight are particularly important for ensuring good governance.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Macroeconomic Identity/Concept          Equation/Description
1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Expenditure Method)   : C + I + G + X – M
2. Gross National Product (GNP)             : GDP + Net Factor Income from Abroad
3. Net National Product (NNP)               : GNP – Depreciation
4. National Income (NI)                     : NNP at market prices – Net Indirect Taxes
5. Personal Disposable Income (PDI)         : PI – Personal Tax Payments – Non-tax Payments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

These pairs correctly define fundamental macroeconomic identities.  These identities are crucial for understanding the relationships between different measures of national income and output.

* **GDP (Expenditure Method):** This accurately represents GDP as the sum of consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), exports (X), and net imports (M).

* **GNP:** This correctly defines GNP as GDP adjusted for net factor income earned abroad, reflecting the income accruing to residents of a country, regardless of where it is earned.

* **NNP:** This correctly states that NNP is GNP less depreciation, accounting for capital consumption.

* **National Income (NI):** This accurately defines NI as NNP at market prices less net indirect taxes, reflecting income accruing to factors of production.

* **Personal Disposable Income (PDI):** This correctly shows PDI as personal income less taxes and non-tax payments, representing the income available for household consumption and saving.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.  A sound understanding of these macroeconomic identities is essential for analyzing economic performance, formulating economic policies, and understanding the circular flow of income within an economy.  The accurate representation of these identities highlights a strong grasp of fundamental macroeconomic concepts.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Tax                                  Characteristic
1. Proportional Tax                             : Tax rate remains constant across income levels.
2. Progressive Tax                             : Tax rate increases with income level.
3. Regressive Tax                              : Tax rate decreases with income level.
4. Direct Tax                                  : Tax levied directly on income or wealth.
5. Indirect Tax                                 : Tax levied on goods and services.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

These pairs correctly define different types of taxes based on their incidence and structure.  Understanding these tax types is crucial for evaluating the equity and efficiency of a tax system.

* **Proportional Tax:**  This accurately describes a tax where the rate remains constant regardless of the taxpayer's income.  Sales taxes are often cited as examples, although they can be regressive in practice.

* **Progressive Tax:** This correctly defines a tax where the rate increases as income rises, aiming for a more equitable distribution of the tax burden.  Income tax systems often exhibit progressive features.

* **Regressive Tax:** This accurately defines a tax where the rate decreases as income increases, disproportionately affecting lower-income individuals.  Sales taxes are often cited as examples of regressive taxes.

* **Direct Tax:** This correctly describes taxes levied directly on income or wealth, such as income tax, property tax, and corporate tax.

* **Indirect Tax:** This accurately describes taxes levied on goods and services, such as sales tax, excise duty, and VAT.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs.  The correct matching of all five pairs demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of different tax types and their implications for tax policy and economic equity.  The distinction between direct and indirect taxes is particularly relevant for understanding the impact of taxation on different income groups and the economy as a whole.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Macroeconomic Variable                     Definition/Description
1. Net investment                              :  Gross investment minus depreciation
2. Net National Product (NNP) at market price :  GNP minus indirect taxes
3. Nominal GDP                                :  GDP evaluated at constant prices
4. Personal Disposable Income (PDI)          :  Personal Income plus Personal Tax Payments
5. Real exchange rate                         :  The number of units of domestic currency needed to buy one unit of foreign currency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Net investment accurately reflects the addition to the capital stock after accounting for depreciation.  Option (a) is partially correct, but the inclusion of other options makes it incomplete. Option (b) is incorrect because NNP at market price is GNP minus depreciation. Nominal GDP is calculated at current market prices, not constant prices; real GDP uses constant prices.  Personal Disposable Income is Personal Income minus Personal Tax Payments and Non-tax payments, not plus. The real exchange rate represents the relative price of foreign goods in terms of domestic goods; the nominal exchange rate is the price of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency. Therefore, only pair 1 and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator                       Calculation Method
1. GDP Deflator                           :   Nominal GDP divided by Real GDP
2. Consumer Price Index (CPI)             :   Cost of a basket of goods in the current year divided by the cost of the same basket in the base year, multiplied by 100
3. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)            :   Percentage change in the weighted average price of all goods produced in a country
4.  National Disposable Income             : Net National Product at market prices + Other current transfers from the rest of the world
5. Private Income                          : Factor income from net domestic product accruing to the private sector + National debt interest + Net factor income from abroad + Current transfers from government + Other net transfers from the rest of the world


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GDP deflator accurately reflects the ratio of nominal to real GDP, providing a measure of price changes. The CPI correctly describes the calculation based on a consumer basket of goods. The WPI, however, is not calculated as the percentage change in the weighted average price of *all* goods produced; it focuses on a basket of wholesale goods.  National Disposable Income and Private Income are correctly defined in options 4 and 5 respectively.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Fiscal Policy Measure                   Effect on Equilibrium Income
1. Increase in Government Expenditure  :  Increases equilibrium income through the multiplier effect
2. Decrease in Lump-Sum Taxes         :  Increases equilibrium income through increased disposable income
3. Increase in Proportional Taxes       :  Decreases equilibrium income and reduces the multiplier effect
4. Increase in Transfer Payments       : Increases equilibrium income, but less than an equal increase in government expenditure
5. Balanced Budget Increase in G and T : Equilibrium income remains unchanged


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs correctly reflect the effects of the respective fiscal policy measures on equilibrium income. An increase in government spending directly boosts aggregate demand, leading to a multiplied increase in income.  A decrease in lump-sum taxes raises disposable income, stimulating consumption and income.  An increase in proportional taxes reduces disposable income and dampens the multiplier, leading to a smaller increase in income than an equivalent increase in government spending.  An increase in transfer payments boosts disposable income, but the effect on equilibrium income is less than that of an equal increase in government spending because some of the transfer payments are saved. A balanced budget increase in government spending and taxes leads to a one-to-one increase in equilibrium income. Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Macroeconomic Identity                  Equation
1.  GDP (Expenditure Method)             : C + I + G + X – M
2.  GDP (Income Method)                  : W + P + I + R
3.  Personal Income (PI)                  : NI – UP – Net interest payments by households – Corporate tax + Transfer payments to households
4. Personal Disposable Income (PDI)      : PI + Personal tax payments + Non-tax payments
5. Relationship between Savings and Investment (closed economy, no government): S = I


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The expenditure method of calculating GDP accurately sums consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), exports (X), and subtracts imports (M). The income method correctly states that GDP equals the sum of wages (W), profits (P), interest (I), and rent (R).  Personal Income (PI) is correctly defined as National Income (NI) adjusted for undistributed profits (UP), net interest payments by households, corporate taxes, and transfer payments.  Personal Disposable Income (PDI) is incorrectly defined; it should be PI minus personal tax payments and non-tax payments. The relationship between savings and investment holds true in a closed economy with no government intervention. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Term                                     Description
1. Revenue Deficit                         : Excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts
2.  Automatic Stabilizer                  : A policy that automatically counteracts economic fluctuations (e.g., proportional income tax)
3.  Ricardian Equivalence                 : The theory that consumers anticipate future tax increases to repay government debt and adjust consumption accordingly
4.  Discretionary Fiscal Policy             : Deliberate government actions to stabilize the economy (e.g., changing government spending or taxes)
5.  Balanced Budget Multiplier            : The change in aggregate output resulting from an equal change in government spending and taxes (approximately 1)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. A revenue deficit accurately represents the difference between revenue expenditure and revenue receipts. Proportional income taxes act as automatic stabilizers, smoothing economic fluctuations. Ricardian equivalence describes the theory of consumer behavior in response to government debt. Discretionary fiscal policy involves deliberate government intervention to manage the economy.  The balanced budget multiplier illustrates the effect of equal changes in government spending and taxation on aggregate output, which is approximately 1. Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                         Definition/Description
1.  Divisible Pool                :   Includes Cess and Surcharge levied by the Union Government
2.  Vertical Devolution           :   Allocation of central tax proceeds among states
3.  Horizontal Devolution        :   Distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Centre and the states
4.  Grants-in-Aid (Article 275) :   Untied grants with no restrictions on how states can spend them
5.  Consolidated Fund of India   :   Receives the 41% share of central taxes devolved to states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because vertical devolution refers to the distribution of central tax proceeds among states, and horizontal devolution refers to the distribution of net proceeds of taxes between the Centre and states.  These definitions align precisely with the text's descriptions.

Option (b) is incorrect because the Divisible Pool explicitly excludes Cess and Surcharge.  The definition provided in pair 1 is, therefore, false.

Option (c) is incorrect because Grants-in-Aid under Article 275 are *tied* grants, not untied as stated in pair 4.  Furthermore, the 41% share of central taxes devolved to states never becomes part of the Consolidated Fund of India (pair 5).

Option (d) is incorrect for the reasons explained above regarding pairs 4 and 5.  The Consolidated Fund of India does not receive the devolved share of central taxes.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Grant                  Characteristic
1. Revenue Deficit Grants        :   Recommended for states with inadequate revenue effort
2. Local Body Grants            :   Inter-se distribution among states weighted 90% on area and 10% on population
3. Disaster Management Grants   :   75:25 contribution ratio (Centre:State) for all states, including NE states
4. Sector-Specific Grants        :   Include grants for Power Sector with additional borrowing window for states
5. State-Specific Grants         :   Formula-based devolution to correct deficiency in fiscal capacity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct as Sector-Specific Grants indeed include performance-based incentives for the Power Sector, opening an additional borrowing window for states.  This directly reflects the information provided in the text.

Option (a) is incorrect. While Revenue Deficit Grants aim to correct fiscal capacity deficiencies, they do *not* reward inadequate revenue effort. The description in pair 1 is therefore false.

Option (b) is incorrect. The description of Local Body Grants' inter-se distribution (pair 2) is inaccurate; it's 90% population and 10% area, not vice versa.  Additionally, State-Specific Grants are *not* formula-based; they address special needs not covered by formula-based devolution (pair 5).

Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies highlighted in pairs 2 and 3.  The Disaster Management Grants have a different contribution ratio for NE states (90:10).


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fund/Source                     Description/Use
1.  Rashtriya Suraksha Naivedyam Kosh :   Primarily for welfare of soldiers and paramilitary personnel
2.  State Disaster Risk Management Fund: Subdivided into SDRF and SDMF with 80:20 allocation respectively.
3.  Consolidated Fund of India       :   Source of incremental funding for Rashtriya Suraksha Naivedyam Kosh
4.  Modernisation Fund for Defence and Internal Security:  Includes proceeds from monetisation of surplus defence land
5.  National Calamity Contingency Duty :  Part of the Divisible Pool of tax resources


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the State Disaster Risk Management Fund is indeed subdivided into SDRF and SDMF, with the specified allocation.  The Consolidated Fund of India is a source of funding for the Rashtriya Suraksha Naivedyam Kosh, and the fund does include proceeds from monetizing surplus defense land.

Option (a) is incorrect because the Rashtriya Suraksha Naivedyam Kosh's primary purpose is not solely for the welfare of soldiers and paramilitary personnel; it also funds capital investment for modernization.

Option (b) is incorrect for the same reason as above, plus the inaccuracy in pair 1.

Option (d) is incorrect because more than one pair is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax/Levy                         Characteristic/Source
1.  Central Sales Tax (CST)         :   Destination-based tax
2.  Value Added Tax (VAT)           :   Levied by the Union and collected by the States
3.  Entry Tax                        :   Imposed on movement of goods between states by the recipient state
4.  Stamp Duty                       :   Rate uniform across all states in India
5.  Goods and Services Tax (GST)     :   Subsumes 17 Central and State indirect taxes



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) Only two
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because Entry Tax is levied by the recipient state to protect its tax base and GST subsumes multiple central and state indirect taxes.

Option (b) is incorrect because CST was an origin-based tax, not destination-based (pair 1).

Option (c) is incorrect, as only two pairs are correctly matched.

Option (d) is incorrect because VAT is a state tax, not levied by the Union (pair 2), and Stamp Duty rates vary across states (pair 4).


**5. With reference to the Indian Fiscal System, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                 Description
1.  Fiscal Stimulus                      :   Government's intensive action on financial institutions to ensure loan disbursement
2.  Value Added Tax (VAT)                :   Tax levied on final consumption of goods/services
3.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)     :   More stable than Foreign Institutional Investment (FII)
4.  Authorization for fund withdrawal from Consolidated Fund of India:   Comes from the President of India
5.  All revenues received by the Union Government: Credited to the Contingency Fund of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct.  VAT is indeed a tax on the value added at each stage of a transaction, ultimately borne by the consumer.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because:

*   Fiscal stimulus is a broader, more encompassing government action to boost economic activity (pair 1).
*   FDI is not necessarily more stable than FII (pair 3).
*   Authorization for fund withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund of India comes from Parliament, not the President (pair 4).
*   Union Government revenues are credited to the Consolidated Fund of India, not the Contingency Fund (pair 5).


These questions test factual recall, analysis (matching definitions), and evaluation (determining the accuracy of the pairs).  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring careful consideration of the nuances within each definition.


**1. With reference to the Indian Economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                     Description
1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :  A measure of the value of a currency relative to a basket of other currencies, adjusted for inflation.
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     :   Indicates the improvement in trade competitiveness.
3. Consumer Price Index (CPI)             :   Captures changes in the prices of services.
4. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)            :   Higher weightage of food compared to CPI.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

NEER is a weighted average of a country's currency relative to other currencies, reflecting its value in international trade.  A higher NEER suggests appreciation, while a lower NEER indicates depreciation.  The statement correctly describes its function. CPI measures the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.  It accurately reflects changes in the cost of living and includes services in its calculation.  Therefore, pair 1 and pair 3 are correctly matched.

Pair 2 is incorrect because while REER considers exchange rates and inflation, it doesn't directly *indicate* an improvement in trade competitiveness; rather, it reflects the overall competitiveness of a country's exports after adjusting for exchange rate changes and inflation. A lower REER usually suggests improved competitiveness.  Pair 4 is incorrect because the WPI, which tracks wholesale price changes, typically gives a lower weightage to food compared to the CPI, which focuses on consumer prices and thus gives higher weightage to food items.  The significant difference in weightage between food in CPI and WPI arises from the different basket of goods considered. The CPI weighs food more heavily reflecting household consumption patterns, whereas the WPI reflects a broader range of goods traded at the wholesale level.


**2. With reference to Monetary Policy in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Instrument                      Effect
1. Increase in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)   : Increases money multiplier
2. Increase in Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) : Increases money multiplier
3. Reduction in interest rates              :  Combats economic recession
4. Purchase of Government Securities by RBI: Increases money supply

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

An increase in CRR (the percentage of deposits banks must hold with the RBI) reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thereby decreasing the money multiplier. Similarly, an increase in SLR (the percentage of deposits banks must maintain in liquid assets) also reduces lending capacity, thus lowering the money multiplier.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect.

Lowering interest rates makes borrowing cheaper, stimulating investment and consumption, which helps counter an economic recession. This makes pair 3 correct. When the RBI buys government securities, it injects money into the banking system, increasing the money supply. This makes pair 4 correct.


**3. With reference to Inflation in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Inflation                       Cause/Contributing Factor
1. Demand-pull Inflation                 : Rising interest rates
2. Cost-push Inflation                    : Increase in wages
3. Demand-pull Inflation                 : Expansionary monetary policies
4. Cost-push Inflation                    : Increase in raw material prices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, driving up prices. Expansionary monetary policies, which increase the money supply, can fuel demand-pull inflation.  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched. Cost-push inflation arises from increases in production costs, such as wages or raw material prices. Increases in wages directly increase the cost of production, leading to cost-push inflation, hence pair 2 is correct. Similarly, increases in raw material prices directly translate to higher production costs, contributing to cost-push inflation. Thus, pair 4 is correct.

Rising interest rates have a contractionary effect on the economy, reducing aggregate demand and thus combating inflation, they do not cause demand-pull inflation. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.


**4. With reference to the Indian Financial System, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                    Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                     : Long-term unsecured promissory note
2. Certificate of Deposit                  : Short-term instrument issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks
3. Call Money                              : Short-term finance for interbank transactions
4. Zero-coupon Bonds                     :  Interest-bearing, short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect because it's described as long-term and not short-term. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are short-term debt instruments issued by banks to individuals or corporations.  Pair 2 is incorrect because it attributes CDs to the RBI, when they are primarily issued by commercial banks.  Call money is indeed used for short-term interbank transactions, making pair 3 correct. Zero-coupon bonds are bonds sold at a discount and pay no periodic interest; they are not necessarily short-term and are not usually issued by commercial banks to corporations.  Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.


**5. With reference to  Foreign Investment in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Foreign Investment             Description
1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)       : Investment through capital instruments in listed companies
2. Foreign Institutional Investment (FII)  : Largely non-debt creating capital flow
3. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)       : Involves debt servicing
4. Foreign Institutional Investment (FII)  : Investment in government securities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

FDI involves long-term investments in business enterprises, not necessarily limited to listed companies. Thus, pair 1 is incorrect. FII primarily involves investment in financial instruments like stocks and bonds, which are generally non-debt creating capital flows. This makes pair 2 correct. FDI can indirectly involve debt servicing if the invested funds are used to finance debt obligations.  Hence, pair 3 is correct. FII often involves investment in government securities, making pair 4 correct.



**1. With reference to India's economic policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy                                      Characteristic
1.  Import Substitution                      :   Emphasis on export promotion
2.  Fiscal Stimulus                           :   Reduction in government spending
3.  Expansionary Monetary Policy             :   Increase in interest rates
4.  Tight Monetary Policy                    :   Increase in money supply
5.  Inflation-Indexing Wages                 :   Protection against inflation for wage earners

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Import substitution is an inward-looking trade strategy that focuses on replacing imports with domestic production, the opposite of export promotion. Fiscal stimulus involves increased government spending to boost economic activity, not reduction. Expansionary monetary policy aims to lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing and investment. Tight monetary policy involves measures to reduce money supply and control inflation, often by raising interest rates. Inflation-indexing wages adjusts wages to account for inflation, providing protection to workers.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The options are designed to test the understanding of core macroeconomic concepts and their application to Indian economic policy.  Incorrect options present plausible but ultimately flawed linkages between policies and their characteristics, demanding careful analysis.


**2. With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                     Description
1.  Commercial Paper                       :   Long-term secured debt instrument
2.  Certificate of Deposit                  :   Issued by the Reserve Bank of India to corporations
3.  Call Money                               :   Long-term finance used for interbank transactions
4.  Zero-Coupon Bonds                      :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks
5.  Sovereign Gold Bonds                   :   Investment in foreign government securities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by corporations, not a long-term secured instrument. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term debt instruments issued by banks, not the RBI, to corporations. Call money is short-term interbank lending, not long-term finance. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; the return comes from the difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity. Sovereign Gold Bonds are issued by the Indian government, allowing investment in gold without physical possession, not an investment in foreign securities.  None of the pairs accurately reflect the characteristics of these financial instruments. The question tests detailed knowledge of the Indian financial market and its instruments, requiring precise understanding of each instrument's nature and function.  Distractors include plausible but inaccurate descriptions, making simple memorization insufficient for a correct answer.


**3. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Function/Policy                     Description
1.  Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)                :   Minimum amount banks must hold in gold
2.  Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)          :   Minimum amount banks must hold as government securities
3.  Open Market Operations (OMO)            :   Direct lending to commercial banks
4.  Repo Rate                                :   Rate at which RBI borrows from commercial banks
5.  Reverse Repo Rate                        :   Rate at which commercial banks borrow from RBI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (d) Only two

**Explanation:**

CRR mandates the minimum percentage of deposits that commercial banks must maintain with the RBI as liquid cash, not gold.  SLR requires banks to maintain a specified percentage of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) in the form of liquid assets, which includes government securities. OMO involves the RBI buying or selling government securities in the open market to influence money supply, not direct lending.  The repo rate is the rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks, and the reverse repo rate is the rate at which the RBI borrows money from commercial banks. Thus, only statements 2 and 5 are correctly matched. This question tests understanding of crucial RBI monetary policy tools and their mechanisms.  Distractors involve mixing up the functions and rates, demanding a high level of precision in knowledge.


**4. With reference to India's balance of payments, consider the following pairs:**

   Account                                   Component
1.  Current Account                          :   Foreign direct investment
2.  Capital Account                           :   Exports of goods and services
3.  Trade Balance                             :   Net foreign exchange reserves
4.  Invisibles                               :   Tourism receipts
5.  Official Reserve Transactions             :   Changes in foreign exchange reserves


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The current account includes trade in goods and services, as well as net income and transfers. Foreign direct investment is recorded in the capital account. The trade balance is the difference between exports and imports of goods, not foreign exchange reserves. Invisibles refer to trade in services, such as tourism, shipping, and banking, hence tourism receipts are correctly placed.  Official reserve transactions involve changes in a country's foreign exchange reserves to manage its balance of payments.  Only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched. This question assesses understanding of the components of a nation's balance of payments, distinguishing between current and capital accounts and their sub-components. Incorrect options present plausible but incorrect categorizations, requiring a clear understanding of the BoP framework.


**5. With reference to macroeconomic indicators, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                 Description
1.  Nominal GDP                              :   GDP adjusted for inflation
2.  Real GDP                                 :   GDP measured at current market prices
3.  Per Capita Income                         :   Total national income divided by population
4.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)               :   Measures changes in wholesale prices
5.  Wholesale Price Index (WPI)              :   Measures changes in prices of goods and services consumed by households


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (d) Only one

**Explanation:**

Nominal GDP is calculated using current market prices, while real GDP is adjusted for inflation. Per capita income is correctly defined. CPI measures changes in the price level of consumer goods and services, while WPI tracks changes in wholesale prices. Only statement 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of fundamental macroeconomic indicators and their calculation methods. Distractors involve confusing nominal and real GDP and the functions of CPI and WPI, requiring a strong grasp of these concepts.


**6.  With reference to India's economic development, consider the following pairs:**

   Five-Year Plan                               Focus/Objective
1. Second Five-Year Plan                       :  Emphasis on agriculture
2. Fourth Five-Year Plan                        :  Poverty reduction
3. Fifth Five-Year Plan                         :  Financial sector inclusion
4.  Ninth Five-Year Plan                        :   Infrastructure development
5. Twelfth Five-Year Plan                      :   Inclusive growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3,4 and 5 only
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Second Five-Year Plan prioritized industrial development, particularly heavy industries. The Fourth Five-Year Plan aimed at poverty reduction and income distribution, but this wasn't its sole focus. The Fifth Five-Year Plan did include the financial sector as an integral part. The Ninth Five-Year Plan focused on infrastructure development. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan explicitly aimed for inclusive growth. Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of the objectives of India's Five-Year Plans, requiring recall of specific policy focuses. Distractors involve mixing up the emphasis of different plans, demanding accurate recall of plan objectives.


**7. With reference to the Indian banking sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Bank                                  Characteristic
1. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)                 :   Focus on large corporate lending
2. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)                :   Primarily serve urban areas
3. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)            :   Supervised by the Reserve Bank of India
4. Payment Banks                               :   Cannot accept deposits
5. Scheduled Commercial Banks                 :   Subject to RBI regulations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (d) Only three

**Explanation:**

Small Finance Banks (SFBs) focus on lending to small businesses and farmers, not large corporations. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) primarily serve rural areas. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are indeed supervised by the RBI. Payment Banks can accept deposits. Scheduled Commercial Banks are indeed subject to RBI regulations. Therefore, only statements 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. This question assesses understanding of different types of banks in the Indian financial system and their regulatory frameworks. Distractors involve mixing up the functions and regulatory oversight of various banking institutions, requiring a detailed knowledge of the sector.


**8. With reference to economic development concepts, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                   Description
1. Human Capital Formation                   :   Investment in physical infrastructure
2. Inclusive Growth                          :   Focus on equitable distribution of growth benefits
3. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)             :   Compares prices of identical goods and services across countries
4.  Demand-Pull Inflation                     :   Caused by excessive supply of goods
5.  Capital-Output Ratio                      :   Relationship between investment and output


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Human capital formation involves investment in education, health, and skills development, not physical infrastructure. Inclusive growth aims for equitable distribution of economic benefits. PPP is correctly defined as a method for comparing economic productivity and standards of living between countries. Demand-pull inflation is caused by excessive demand, not supply. Capital-output ratio measures the amount of capital required to produce a unit of output. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. This question tests understanding of key economic development concepts and their definitions. Distractors involve incorrect descriptions or confusing related concepts, requiring precise definition and application of these terms.


**9. With reference to the impact of global events on the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Global Event                                 Impact on India
1.  US Federal Reserve's tight monetary policy  :   Increased capital inflows into India
2.  Rise in global crude oil prices             :   Reduced import costs for India
3.  Global recession                           :   Reduced export demand for Indian goods
4.  Depreciation of the US dollar              :   Makes Indian exports more expensive
5.  Increased foreign investment in India       :   Strengthening of Indian Rupee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

A tight monetary policy in the US usually leads to capital outflows from emerging markets like India, not inflows. Higher global crude oil prices increase import costs for India, a net importer of oil. A global recession reduces demand for exports worldwide, impacting India negatively. A depreciating US dollar makes Indian exports cheaper, not more expensive. Increased foreign investment generally strengthens the domestic currency.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. This question assesses understanding of how global economic events impact the Indian economy, requiring an awareness of international economic linkages. Distractors involve incorrect predictions of the impact of global events on India's economy, demanding a nuanced understanding of international trade and finance.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator                     Description

1.  Increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) : Improvement in trade competitiveness
2.  Increase in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     : Appreciation of the rupee
3.  Increasing divergence between NEER and REER       : Increasing trend in domestic inflation relative to inflation in other countries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

An increase in NEER indicates that the domestic currency has appreciated relative to a basket of other currencies. This is because it takes more units of foreign currency to buy one unit of the domestic currency. An increase in REER, on the other hand, indicates that the domestic currency has appreciated in real terms, taking into account inflation differentials.  This can improve a country's trade competitiveness if the real exchange rate appreciation is not too large, however this is not always the case.  A widening gap between NEER and REER suggests that domestic inflation is rising faster than inflation in other countries. This erosion of purchasing power can hurt competitiveness. Therefore, only pair 3 correctly matches the economic indicator with its description.  Pair 1 is incorrect because an increase in NEER does not directly indicate an improvement in trade competitiveness; it depends on the REER as well.  Pair 2 is incorrect because an increase in REER indicates an appreciation of the domestic currency, not a decline in value.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept                       Effect on Market Demand

1. Increase in price of a substitute good : Decrease in market demand for the good
2. Increase in price of a complement good : Increase in market demand for the good
3. Increase in income of consumers for an inferior good : Decrease in market demand for the good


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 3 accurately reflects the relationship between the economic concept and its effect on market demand. An increase in the price of a substitute good would lead to an *increase*, not a decrease, in the market demand for the original good as consumers switch to the now relatively cheaper alternative.  Conversely, an increase in the price of a complement good would lead to a *decrease*, not an increase, in the market demand for the original good because the two goods are consumed together.  For inferior goods, an increase in consumer income typically leads to a *decrease* in demand for that good as consumers shift to superior substitutes. The other pairs illustrate common misconceptions in understanding the relationship between prices of substitute and complement goods and income changes with respect to inferior goods and their impact on market demand.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Term                      Definition/Characteristic

1. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates   : Calculated by comparing prices of different baskets of goods and services in different countries
2. Closed economy                           :  Neither exports nor imports take place
3.  Hyperinflation                             :  Economic growth coupled with deflation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing the prices of *identical* baskets of goods and services in different countries, not different baskets.  Hyperinflation is characterized by extremely rapid and uncontrolled increases in prices, often coupled with a sharp decline in economic output and value of currency, not economic growth with deflation. A closed economy is an economy that does not engage in international trade, meaning neither exports nor imports take place.  The inaccuracies in the definitions of PPP and hyperinflation highlight common misunderstandings in macroeconomic concepts. These incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors in a multiple-choice question format, testing a candidate's thorough understanding of fundamental economic principles.


**4. With reference to inclusive growth, consider the following pairs:**

Policy Objective                       Policy Action

1. Poverty Reduction                    : Strengthening capital markets
2. Balanced Regional Development       : Increasing government spending on public health in all districts
3. Employment Promotion                 : Promoting Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Promoting MSMEs directly contributes to employment promotion, a key component of inclusive growth. Strengthening capital markets, while important for overall economic growth, does not directly address poverty reduction in a targeted manner.  Increased government spending on public health, while beneficial for overall well-being, does not guarantee balanced regional development. The other pairings highlight potential distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the specific policy tools needed to achieve inclusive growth objectives.  The question assesses analytical skills by requiring candidates to differentiate between direct and indirect approaches to achieving inclusive growth policy goals.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Situation                       Characteristic

1. Melt Down                             : Fall in GDP
2. Recession                              : Fall in growth rate
3. Slow Down                             : Fall in stock prices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. A recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. A melt-down typically refers to a sharp and sudden collapse in financial markets, often involving a significant fall in stock prices.  A slowdown is a period of reduced economic growth, but not necessarily a decline. The other pairings highlight common misconceptions in the terminology of macroeconomic situations and test the candidate’s ability to distinguish subtle differences in economic definitions.


**6.  With reference to India's economic development, consider the following pairs:**

Five-Year Plan                     Policy Shift

1. Fourth Plan                        : Lower emphasis on heavy industries and more on infrastructure
2. Sixth Plan                         : Increased investment in rural areas, rural infrastructure and agriculture
3. Eighth Plan                        : Shift in the pattern of industrialization with lower emphasis on heavy industries and more on infrastructure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-97) marked a significant shift in India's industrialization strategy, placing greater emphasis on infrastructure development and reducing the focus on heavy industries.  While the Fourth Plan did involve some infrastructural development, it wasn't the primary policy shift.  The Sixth Plan focused on poverty alleviation and employment generation through various rural development programs, not a direct shift in industrialization patterns. The other options serve as distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of India's Five-Year Plans and their respective policy focuses.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

GDP Calculation Method              Description

1. Expenditure Method                  : Sum of all factor payments (wages, profits, rent, interest)
2. Income Method                       : Sum of all final expenditures (consumption, investment, government spending, net exports)
3. Product or Value-Added Method      : Sum of value added at each stage of production


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 accurately describes the Product or Value-Added Method of calculating GDP. This method sums the value added at each stage of production to avoid double-counting. The Expenditure Method sums final expenditures, and the Income Method sums factor payments.  The incorrect pairings act as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of different approaches to GDP calculation.  The question assesses conceptual understanding and factual recall of macroeconomic accounting methods.


**8. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

Economic Policy                         Outcome

1. Liberalisation                          : Increased foreign direct investment
2. Privatisation                           : Reduced government control over industries
3. Globalisation                            : Deceleration in agricultural growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 correctly link the economic policy with its outcome. Liberalisation policies led to increased foreign direct investment in India. Privatisation reduced government control over various industries.  However, the deceleration in agricultural growth wasn't a direct outcome of globalization itself; it was influenced by other factors like reduced public investment in agriculture and increased international competition.  The other options are distractors, testing the candidate’s ability to analyze the multifaceted impacts of economic policies. This question assesses analytical and evaluative skills by requiring candidates to consider both direct and indirect consequences of economic reforms.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

Poverty Measurement Metric             Characteristic

1.  Tendulkar Committee Report          : Higher poverty line than Rangarajan Committee Report
2. Rangarajan Committee Report          : Lower poverty line than Tendulkar Committee Report
3. Consumption expenditure data     : Data source for poverty estimation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Rangarajan Committee Report used a higher poverty line than the Tendulkar Committee Report. Consumption expenditure data from the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) serves as a primary data source for poverty estimation in India.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of different approaches to poverty measurement in India.  The incorrect pairing serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the specifics of these reports and their relative poverty lines.


**10. With reference to human capital formation in India, consider the following pairs:**

Source of Human Capital Formation        Example

1. Investment in education              : On-the-job training
2. Investment in health                 : Preventive medicine
3. Investment in information           : Migration of skilled labor


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Investment in health encompasses preventive medicine.  Investment in information plays a role in improving access to educational opportunities and better job prospects, although migration of skilled labor is a consequence, not a direct investment in information itself.  On-the-job training is primarily considered as a form of investment in human capital rather than investment in education.  The other options serve as distractors, testing the candidate’s understanding of different sources and aspects of human capital formation.  The question tests conceptual understanding and requires candidates to distinguish between direct and indirect investments in human capital.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Five Year Plan                         Event
1. Third Five Year Plan                 :   Emergency clamped
2. Fourth Five Year Plan                :   Janata Party elected
3. Fifth Five Year Plan                  :   New elections took place
4. Sixth Five Year Plan                  :   Emphasis on heavy industries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Emergency in India was declared during the reign of Indira Gandhi in 1975, which falls under the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974-79).  The Janata Party came to power after the 1977 general elections, which followed the Emergency.  Therefore, option (b) is correct as it correctly matches the Janata Party's election with the Fifth Five-Year Plan period. Option (a) incorrectly links the Emergency to the Third Five-Year Plan. Option (c) incorrectly connects new elections to the Fifth Five-Year Plan; while new elections did occur, the key event associated with the Fifth plan was the Janata Party's rise to power post-Emergency. Option (d) is incorrect because while new elections and the Janata party's election are linked to the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the emphasis on heavy industries is associated with the Second Five-Year Plan.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Five Year Plan                     Policy Emphasis
1. Second Five Year Plan             :   Import substitution
2. Third Five Year Plan               :   Human development
3. Fifth Five Year Plan                :   Emphasis on heavy industries
4. Seventh Five Year Plan             :   Agricultural and rural development
5. Eighth Five Year Plan              :    Minimum basic amenities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Second Five-Year Plan (1956-61) prioritized the establishment of heavy industries as a cornerstone of industrialization.  The Third Five Year Plan did not focus on human development as its core; that emphasis emerged later. The Fifth Five-Year Plan didn't have a primary focus on heavy industries; the Second Five-Year Plan did. The Seventh Five-Year Plan emphasized technological advancements and infrastructure development, not solely agricultural and rural development. The Eighth Five-Year Plan focused on infrastructure growth and poverty alleviation, not specifically minimum basic amenities as a singular emphasis.  Therefore, only option (d) is correct, highlighting the Second Five-Year Plan's emphasis on heavy industries.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                          Definition
1. National Income                         :   Gross National Product at market prices minus depreciation plus net factor income from abroad
2. Per Capita Income                      :   Increase in price level
3. Gross National Product                  :   Gross National Product at market prices minus depreciation and indirect taxes plus subsidies
4. Gross Domestic Product                : Growth of money supply


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

National Income is accurately defined as Gross National Product at market prices minus depreciation, adding net factor income from abroad. The growth rate of Per Capita Income is affected by population growth and price levels, not solely the increase in price level.  Gross National Product is not defined as stated in option 3; it usually refers to the total value of goods and services produced by a country's residents regardless of location.  Gross Domestic Product is not defined by the growth of money supply; it's the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders.  Therefore, only option (a) provides a correct definition of National Income.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy/Event                     Description
1. Economic Liberalization in India          :   Significant reduction in tax rates
2. Eighth Five Year Plan                    :   Considerably larger outlay compared to earlier plans
3. Imperative Planning                     :   Market mechanism entirely replaced by a command hierarchy
4. Indicative Planning                      :   Improves functioning of the market system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While economic liberalization in India involved multiple facets, a significant reduction in tax rates was a key component.  The Eighth Five-Year Plan did involve a larger outlay, but it's not the defining characteristic.  Imperative planning is correctly defined as a system where the market mechanism is replaced by a command hierarchy. Indicative planning appropriately aims to improve the market system's functioning. Therefore, only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options 1 and 2 are partially correct but not the most accurate description of the events.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Poverty Related Concept/Program          Description
1. Poverty Line                              :   Jail cost of living adjusted for children
2. Antyodaya                                 :   Integrating the poor into the mainstream
3. Food for Work Programme                 :   Expanding self-employment programs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji's initial concept of the poverty line used a "jail cost of living" adjusted for children, representing a rudimentary approach. Antyodaya, a key philosophy of Indian planning, aimed to uplift the poorest and integrate them into the mainstream. The Food for Work Programme, while aiming to alleviate poverty, primarily focused on wage employment and asset creation, not self-employment expansion.  Therefore, options 1 and 2 are correctly matched, while option 3 misrepresents the program's core focus.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Poverty Alleviation Program              Objective
1. National Rural Employment Guarantee Act-2005 :   Guaranteed wage employment for 100 days
2.  Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana    :   Self-employment opportunities in urban areas
3. Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana        :   Wage employment in rural areas
4. Prime Minister’s Rozgar Yojana           :  Financial assistance for small industries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) aimed to provide guaranteed wage employment for at least 100 days a year.  Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY) indeed focused on creating employment opportunities in urban areas. Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana (SGRY) aimed at generating rural wage employment.  Prime Minister’s Rozgar Yojana (PMRY) provided financial assistance to set up small-scale enterprises. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Reform Measure                  Impact
1.  Abolition of industrial licensing         : Increased efficiency and competitiveness
2.  Reduction in import tariffs               :  Protected domestic industries
3.  Devaluation of the rupee                : Increased inflow of foreign exchange
4.  Establishment of private sector banks    : Reduced the role of RBI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Removing industrial licensing aimed at increasing efficiency and competitiveness by reducing bureaucratic hurdles. Devaluation of the rupee did increase the inflow of foreign exchange by making Indian goods cheaper. The other options are mismatched. Reducing import tariffs aimed to increase competition, not protect domestic industries (although it had some protective effects). The establishment of private sector banks increased competition, but it didn't necessarily reduce the RBI's role as a regulator; it shifted the RBI's focus to a more facilitative role.  Therefore, only options 1 and 3 represent accurate linkages between reform measures and their impacts.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept of Inclusive Growth             Attribute
1. Opportunity                             :   Providing means to protect against livelihood loss
2. Capability                              :   Generating more income opportunities
3. Access                                  :   Bringing opportunities and capabilities together
4. Security                                 :   Enhancing people's capabilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The opportunity attribute of inclusive growth focuses on generating income opportunities, not protecting against livelihood loss (that's security). The capability attribute emphasizes enhancing people's skills and capabilities. The access attribute centers on connecting opportunities with capabilities. The security attribute focuses on protecting against livelihood loss.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched in their descriptions of the attributes of inclusive growth.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                         Characteristic
1. Consumer Price Index (CPI)                 :   Higher weightage of food than WPI
2. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)               : Captures changes in service prices
3. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)   :  Improvement in trade competitiveness


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CPI gives a higher weightage to food items compared to the WPI. The WPI primarily focuses on wholesale prices of goods, and does not capture service price changes effectively. NEER reflects the value of a currency relative to other currencies, not necessarily trade competitiveness.  Therefore, only option (a) is correct, accurately reflecting the characteristic of the CPI.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Pre-1991 Economic Policy Feature          Effect
1. License Raj                               :   Thwarted competition and entrepreneurship
2. Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act 1969: Crippled private industry
3. Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) :   Led to timely shift from export pessimism
4. Reservation for small-scale industries    :   Enabled reaping benefits of economies of scale


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The License Raj's excessive regulations significantly hindered competition and entrepreneurship. The MRTP Act, while intending to curb monopolies, had the unintended consequence of crippling private sector growth.  Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) did not lead to a timely shift away from export pessimism; it actually reinforced inward-looking policies. Reservations for small-scale industries prevented the exploitation of economies of scale. Therefore, only options 1 and 2 are correctly matched in terms of their effects.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                  Value/Characteristic in 2003 (India/China)
1. Sectoral Contribution to GDP (Agriculture) :  Higher percentage in India than in China
2. Sectoral Contribution to GDP (Manufacturing): Higher percentage in China than in India
3. Sectoral Contribution to GDP (Services)     :  Higher percentage in India than in China

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

In 2003, India's economy was still heavily reliant on agriculture, contributing a larger percentage to its GDP compared to China.  China, having undergone significant industrialization, had a higher share of manufacturing in its GDP. While India was also experiencing growth in the services sector, its contribution to the GDP was still proportionally higher than China's in 2003.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, reflecting the distinct sectoral compositions of the Indian and Chinese economies at that time. The options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they fail to capture the complete and accurate representation of the sectoral contributions to GDP in India and China during 2003.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to distinguish between the economic structures of two major developing nations.

**2. With reference to India's economic development, consider the following pairs:**

   Five-Year Plan Feature                     Characteristic
1. First Five Year Plan (India)                :  Emphasis on agriculture and infrastructure development
2. Second Five Year Plan (India)              :  Focus on heavy industries and industrialization
3. Five-Year Plan pattern of development (Pakistan/China):  Adopted by both Pakistan and China in the initial stages of their development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India's First Five-Year Plan prioritized agriculture and infrastructure development, aligning with its post-independence needs.  The Second Five-Year Plan shifted focus towards heavy industries to bolster industrial growth.  Both Pakistan and China, in their early developmental phases, adopted the five-year plan pattern, although the specifics of their plans differed significantly.  Therefore, all three pairs accurately reflect aspects of economic planning in India and the broader adoption of five-year plan models in other Asian nations. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and fail to recognize the historical accuracy of all three pairs. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of historical economic policies in South Asia.

**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Developmental Strategy              Key Feature/Characteristic
1.  Imperative Planning                 :  Complete replacement of market mechanism by a command hierarchy
2. Indicative Planning                  :  Utilizes market mechanisms to improve the functioning of the economic system
3.  Sustainable Development             :   Meets present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Imperative planning is characterized by centralized control and the suppression of market forces. Indicative planning, in contrast, works within a market framework, providing guidance and incentives rather than direct control.  Sustainable development, as defined by the Brundtland Report, explicitly balances present needs with the sustainability of resources for future generations.  All three pairs accurately define the core characteristics of these distinct economic and developmental strategies. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and fail to represent the full scope of the concepts, thus demonstrating a lack of conceptual understanding. The question tests conceptual understanding and the ability to differentiate between various development models.


**4. With reference to India's economic history, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Reform Period                Prominent Feature
1. Pre-1991 Era                           :  Socialist-inspired policies with considerable state control
2. Post-1991 Era (Liberalization)         :  Emphasis on market liberalization, privatization, and globalization
3.  Post-2014 Era (NITI Aayog)           :  Shift towards cooperative federalism and bottom-up planning

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The pre-1991 Indian economy was largely characterized by socialist policies, including substantial state intervention and control.  The 1991 reforms ushered in an era of liberalization, privatization, and globalization.  The establishment of NITI Aayog in 2014 marked a shift towards greater collaboration with states and a bottom-up approach to policy formulation, contrasting with the earlier centralized planning. All three pairs accurately reflect key features of these distinct periods in India's economic history. Options (a), (b), and (c) demonstrate a partial or incomplete understanding of India's economic evolution. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of India's economic policy shifts over time.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                       Definition/Characteristic
1.  Human Capital Formation              :  Investment in education, health, and training to enhance productivity
2.  Poverty Line                           :  Minimum level of consumption expenditure needed for survival
3.  Inclusive Growth                       :  Broad-based economic growth that benefits all segments of society

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Human capital formation involves investments that improve the skills and capabilities of the workforce.  The poverty line represents a minimum consumption level to ensure basic survival. Inclusive growth emphasizes equitable distribution of economic benefits across society.  All three pairs accurately reflect the core definitions of these essential economic concepts. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and show a lack of comprehensive understanding of the terms, highlighting potential misconceptions.  The question assesses conceptual understanding and the ability to define key economic terms.


**6. With reference to India’s economic development, consider the following pairs:**

  Economic Policy/Initiative          Objective/Outcome
1.  MGNREGA                             :  Rural employment guarantee
2.  Aadhaar                              :   Unique biometric identification system
3.  Disinvestment of PSUs              : To mobilize government revenue

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) aims to guarantee a minimum number of days of wage employment to rural households. Aadhaar is a national biometric identification program designed to provide a unique identity to each citizen. Disinvestment of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) is a government strategy to raise revenue by partially or fully selling off state-owned enterprises. All three pairs accurately reflect the objectives and outcomes of these government policies. Options (a), (b), and (c) would indicate a lack of understanding of these important government initiatives.  This question tests factual knowledge and the ability to link government policies with their intended goals.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Organization                  Function/Role
1. SEBI                                   : Regulates stock exchanges and capital markets
2. NITI Aayog                              :  Replaced the Planning Commission
3. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)            :  Manages the nation's monetary policy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is responsible for regulating the securities market. NITI Aayog succeeded the Planning Commission as the primary policy think tank of the Indian government.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the central bank of India, responsible for monetary policy.  All three pairs accurately describe the roles and functions of these crucial institutions. Options (a), (b), and (c) demonstrate a lack of awareness of the roles of these key economic bodies. This question assesses factual knowledge about important Indian institutions.


**8. With reference to post-1991 economic reforms in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Measure                          Impact/Outcome
1.  Reduction in import duties              : Increased international competition for domestic industries
2.  Removal of quantitative restrictions   :  Greater access to imported goods for consumers
3.  Increased FDI inflows                  :  Enhanced capital investment and economic growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lowering import duties made imported goods cheaper, increasing competition for domestic producers. Removing quantitative restrictions (quotas) increased the availability of imported goods. Increased foreign direct investment (FDI) fueled economic activity and job creation.  All three pairs accurately reflect the consequences of these reform measures. Options (a), (b), and (c) show a partial or incomplete understanding of the impact of the reforms.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the consequences of economic liberalization.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                           Description
1.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)           : Total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders
2.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)          :  Compares the price of a basket of goods and services across countries
3.  Gini Coefficient                       : Measures income inequality within a population

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

GDP measures the total economic output of a country. PPP adjusts exchange rates to reflect the relative purchasing power of different currencies. The Gini coefficient quantifies income disparity within a society.  All three pairs correctly define these fundamental economic terms. Options (a), (b), and (c) indicate a lack of understanding of these core economic concepts. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of key economic terminology.


**10. With reference to the challenges of inclusive growth in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Challenge                                  Related Issue
1.  Poverty                                  :  Lack of education and skills among the poor
2.  Employment                              :  High proportion of workers in the unorganized sector
3.  Regional Disparities                     :  Uneven development across different states

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Poverty is exacerbated by a lack of education and skills, limiting employment opportunities.  A large portion of India’s workforce is in the informal sector, which often lacks job security and benefits.  Regional disparities are evident in the uneven distribution of economic development across states.  All three pairs accurately link the challenges of inclusive growth with their underlying causes. Options (a), (b), and (c) demonstrate a partial understanding of the complexities of inclusive growth.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the challenges to achieving inclusive growth in India.




**1. With reference to economic indicators, consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator                                    Description
1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)          :   Measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies, without adjusting for inflation.
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)             :   Measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies, adjusted for inflation.
3. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates    :   Calculated by comparing prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries.
4. Consumer Price Index (CPI)                        :   Measures the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.
5. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)                       :   Measures the average change in prices received by domestic producers for their output.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched.  The NEER reflects the value of a currency relative to others without considering inflation. The REER adjusts for inflation, providing a more accurate picture of a currency's real value. PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing the cost of a standard basket of goods across different countries, offering insights into relative purchasing power. The CPI tracks price changes for consumer goods and services, while the WPI focuses on prices received by producers.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair. Option (c) is the only one that includes all five correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to economic policies and schemes, consider the following pairs:**

Policy/Scheme                                       Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana                      :   Provide pension to old and destitute persons
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme                         :   Reduce India's dependence on gold imports
3. Gold Monetization Scheme                          :   Bring idle gold lying with households into the economy
4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme                          :   Provide short-term credit for post-harvest expenses
5. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)                         :   Supply credit to small business units

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system, not to provide pensions.  The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme indeed aim to reduce India's dependence on gold imports and bring idle gold into the economy. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme does provide short-term credit support for post-harvest expenses. Small Finance Banks (SFBs) focus on supplying credit to small business units, small and marginal farmers, and encouraging young entrepreneurs. Option (a) is incomplete, missing the correct pairing of SFBs. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the wrongly matched pair of MUDRA Yojana. Option (d) is incorrect because more than one pair is correctly matched.  Only option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to financial instruments and concepts, consider the following pairs:**

Financial Instrument/Concept                          Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                                  :   A long-term instrument issued by the RBI
2. Certificate of Deposit                              :   A short-term unsecured promissory note
3. Call money                                         :   Short-term finance used for interbank transactions
4. Zero-coupon Bonds                                 :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by commercial banks
5. Legal tender money                                :   Money a creditor is compelled to accept in settlement of claims

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) Only two
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note, not a long-term RBI instrument. Certificates of deposit are short-term instruments, not long-term ones issued by the RBI. Call money is indeed used for short-term interbank transactions. Zero-coupon bonds are not interest-bearing and are not necessarily short-term. Legal tender money is correctly described as money a creditor must accept. Options (b), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Only option (a) correctly identifies the two accurately matched pairs.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

Economic Factor                                     Effect on Currency Crisis Risk
1. Foreign currency earnings of India's IT sector   :   Increases risk
2. Increasing government expenditure               :   Reduces risk
3. Remittances from Indians abroad                 :   Reduces risk
4. Curbing imports and promoting exports           :   Reduces risk
5. Easing external commercial borrowing conditions :   Increases risk

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) Only three
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency earnings from the IT sector and remittances from Indians abroad help bolster foreign exchange reserves, reducing the risk of a currency crisis. Curbing imports and promoting exports also strengthens the balance of payments, lessening the vulnerability to a crisis. Increasing government expenditure, however, can worsen a currency crisis if it leads to higher inflation and increased demand for foreign currency. Easing conditions for external commercial borrowing can increase the risk of a crisis by increasing the country’s dependence on foreign loans. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  Option (a) accurately identifies the two correctly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to monetary policy tools, consider the following pairs:**

Monetary Policy Tool                         Effect on Money Multiplier
1. Increase in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)     :   Increases money multiplier
2. Increase in Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR):   Increases money multiplier
3. Increase in banking habit of population   :   Decreases money multiplier
4. Expansionary monetary policy              :   Increases money multiplier
5. Increase in population                     :   Increases money multiplier

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 4 only
(c) Only two
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Increasing the CRR or SLR reduces the money multiplier as banks have less money available to lend.  An increase in the banking habit of the population increases the money multiplier as more deposits lead to more lending. Expansionary monetary policy, which involves lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply, increases the money multiplier.  A rise in population does not directly impact the money multiplier. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit the correctly matched pair or include incorrectly matched pairs. Only option (a) correctly identifies the two accurately matched pairs.


**6. With reference to macroeconomic concepts, consider the following pairs:**

Macroeconomic Concept                          Description
1. Potential GDP                               :  The maximum level of output an economy can produce with its existing resources and technology
2. V-shaped recovery                            :   A sharp decline in economic activity followed by a rapid and strong recovery
3. Demand-pull inflation                         :   Inflation caused by an increase in aggregate demand exceeding aggregate supply
4. Seigniorage                                 :   Profit from money creation
5. Money multiplier                              :   The amount by which an initial deposit can increase the overall money supply

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Potential GDP represents the economy's maximum output capacity. A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a swift rebound after a downturn. Demand-pull inflation arises from excessive aggregate demand. Seigniorage is the profit a government earns from issuing currency. The money multiplier shows how an initial deposit magnifies the money supply. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, omitting at least one correctly matched pair. Option (c) encompasses all five accurate matches.


**7. With reference to India's economic development, consider the following pairs:**

Economic Period/Policy                          Characteristic
1. India's economic liberalization (post-1990s) :   Slowed economic growth
2. Import Substitution Industrialization         :   Aimed at replacing imports with domestic production
3. Industrial Policy Resolution 1956             :   Classified industries into three categories based on ownership
4. Five-Year Plans (pre-1991)                    :   Emphasized a socialist pattern of society
5.  Amrit Kaal                                   :   A 25-year period leading up to India@100

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) All five
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India's economic liberalization accelerated growth, not slowed it. Import substitution aimed at replacing imports with domestic production. The 1956 Industrial Policy Resolution categorized industries by ownership.  Pre-1991 Five-Year Plans emphasized a socialist pattern. Amrit Kaal is the 25-year period leading to India's centenary. Option (a) is incomplete, missing one correct pairing. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the mismatched pair related to liberalization. Option (d) is also incorrect because it is missing one correctly matched pair. Option (b) accurately captures the correctly matched pairs.


**8. With reference to  inclusive growth, consider the following pairs:**

Concept                                            Description
1. Inclusive growth                               :   Focuses solely on income redistribution
2. Pro-poor growth (absolute definition)          :   Poor people benefit in absolute terms
3. Pro-poor growth (relative definition)           :   Incomes of poor grow faster than the population's
4.  Features of Inclusive Growth (World Bank)   :   Emphasizes only income distribution targets
5.  Inclusive Growth Attributes                   : Includes opportunity, capability, access, and security

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Inclusive growth encompasses broader objectives beyond income redistribution, focusing on opportunity, capability, access, and security.  The absolute definition of pro-poor growth correctly emphasizes absolute gains for the poor, while the relative definition focuses on faster income growth for the poor compared to the overall population. The World Bank's features of inclusive growth do not limit the focus to specific targets, but rather emphasize broad-based and sustained growth.  Inclusive growth attributes correctly include opportunity, capability, access, and security. Option (a) is incomplete, missing one correctly matched pair. Option (b) is incomplete and option (d) is incorrect because there are more than one correctly matched pair. Option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**9. With reference to employment and economic activity, consider the following pairs:**

Term                                               Definition
1. Economic Activity                               :   Activities that do not contribute to national income
2. Worker                                          :   Only those paid by an employer
3. Employment                                      :  Engagement in any economic activity
4.  Informal Employment                           :   Employment with no social security benefits
5.  Gross National Product (GNP)                 :   Total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Only two
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Economic activity correctly refers to activities that contribute to national income. A worker includes both those employed and self-employed. Employment encompasses engagement in any economic activity. Informal employment often lacks social security benefits. GNP is the total value of goods and services produced by a country's residents, regardless of location. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs related to economic activity, worker, and GNP. Only option (a) correctly identifies the two accurately matched pairs.


**10. With reference to infrastructure in India, consider the following pairs:**

Infrastructure Type                                    Characteristic
1. Energy infrastructure in rural India              :   High access to electricity and improved sanitation
2. Transportation infrastructure                   :   Facilitates trade and commerce
3. Communication infrastructure                   :   Attracts multinational companies
4. Health infrastructure                           :   Reduces morbidity from waterborne diseases
5. Social Infrastructure                           :   Includes education, housing, and sanitation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Energy infrastructure in rural India typically has limited access to electricity and improved sanitation. Transportation infrastructure is crucial for efficient movement of goods, boosting trade and commerce. Communication infrastructure, especially advanced systems, attracts multinational companies. Health infrastructure is linked to better health outcomes, including reduced morbidity from waterborne diseases. Social infrastructure includes education, housing, and sanitation. Option (a) is incorrect because it includes the wrongly matched pair related to energy infrastructure. Option (b) is incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because more than one pair is correctly matched. Option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                       Definition/Description
1.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)                :   Total value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period.
2.  Net Domestic Product (NDP)                 :   GDP minus depreciation of capital goods.
3.  Net National Product (NNP)                 :   NDP plus net income from abroad.
4.  Per Capita Product (PCP)                   :   Total national income divided by the total population.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. GDP represents the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's geographical boundaries during a specific period. NDP subtracts depreciation from GDP to account for the wear and tear of capital goods. NNP further adjusts NDP by adding net income earned from abroad (income received from abroad minus income paid to foreign entities). Finally, PCP calculates the average income per person by dividing the total national income by the population.  These are fundamental concepts in macroeconomics and are essential for understanding a nation's economic performance.  Any deviation from these definitions would represent a misunderstanding of core economic principles.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                           Characteristic/Feature
1. Mixed Economy in India                   :   Primarily driven by the private sector.
2. First Five Year Plan Priority             :   Industrialization
3. Second Generation Economic Reforms       :   Focus on legal system reforms.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  India's mixed economy involves a significant presence of both the public and private sectors, not primarily the private sector. The First Five Year Plan prioritized agricultural development, not industrialization.  While the second generation of economic reforms did involve some legal system reforms, it primarily focused on other areas like public sector reforms and infrastructure development.  The options present common misconceptions about Indian economic policy and its historical context. Understanding the nuances of these policies requires a thorough grasp of Indian economic history and development strategies.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                      Reason for Low Labour Proportion in GNP
1. Gross National Product (GNP)             :   Wages lag behind prices.
2.  High Savings Economy                    :  High capital-output ratio.
3. Eleventh Five Year Plan Highest Allocation: Energy sector

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. A high capital-output ratio means that a large amount of capital investment is needed to generate a unit of output, potentially leading to lower labour productivity and a smaller labour proportion in GNP.  While wages lagging behind prices could influence labour's share in GNP, it's not the primary reason. The Eleventh Five Year Plan prioritized physical infrastructure, not the energy sector, for the highest allocation. The question tests the understanding of macroeconomic indicators and their interrelationships, as well as knowledge of India's Five-Year Plans.  Distractors cleverly use related but ultimately inaccurate information.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                          Effect of Doubling Prices and Monetary Income
1. Real Income                               :   Remains unchanged.
2.  Country's Wealth                          :   Includes money supply.
3. Inclusive Growth                           :   Development of infrastructural facilities.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. If both prices and monetary income double, real income (purchasing power) remains constant because the proportional increase in income offsets the proportional increase in prices. Inclusive growth does necessitate the development of infrastructural facilities as a key component, alongside other social and economic improvements.  However, a country's wealth does *not* include money supply; it encompasses productive assets, natural resources, and other forms of capital.  The question assesses understanding of basic economic principles and the multi-faceted nature of inclusive growth. The distractors are designed to challenge candidates' understanding of the concepts.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Event                                    Chronological Order (Earliest to Latest)
1. First Five Year Plan submitted to Parliament :  Before National Development Council setup
2. India became a member of IMF              :  After First devaluation of Indian currency
3. First devaluation of Indian currency       :   After National Development Council setup

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The National Development Council was established after the First Five Year Plan was presented to Parliament.  The other pairs present a misrepresentation of the chronological order of these significant events in Indian economic history. The correct answer requires detailed knowledge of Indian economic history and the sequence of key policy decisions.  The distractors test the candidate’s ability to discern subtle yet crucial differences in the timeline of events.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

  Developmental Strategy                     Characteristic
1. Growth Centre Approach                    :   Implemented under the First Five Year Plan.
2.  Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) :  Aimed at replacing imports with domestic production.
3.  Liberalization, Privatization, Globalization (LPG) Reforms :  Introduced in 1991 to address an economic crisis.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) was a strategy aimed at replacing imports with domestically produced goods.  The LPG reforms were indeed introduced in 1991 in response to an economic crisis. However, the Growth Centre Approach is not directly linked to the First Five Year Plan in the way the question implies; it was a broader developmental strategy employed across various plans. The question demands a nuanced understanding of Indian economic policy and its evolution over time. The distractors test the candidate's knowledge of the context and the precise nature of each strategy.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Concept                       Indicator/Measurement
1. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates :   Calculated by comparing prices of a basket of goods across countries.
2. Consumer Price Index (CPI)                :   Gives lower weight to food items than Wholesale Price Index (WPI).
3. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)               :   Includes changes in service prices.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries. However, CPI gives a *higher* weight to food items than WPI, and WPI does *not* capture changes in service prices, unlike CPI.  The question tests the understanding of economic indicators used to measure inflation and economic activity, and the differences in their methodologies.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate’s precise knowledge of these indicators.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

     Economic Situation                     Cause/Factor
1. Increase in absolute and per capita real GNP :   Poverty and unemployment increase.
2. High saving economy, low output increase   :   Weak administrative machinery.
3. Market demand for a good increases        :   Price of its complement increases.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  A high saving economy may not translate to significant output increase if there is a high capital-output ratio or inefficiencies in the economy, including weak administrative machinery. Increases in absolute and per capita real GNP are generally associated with decreasing poverty and unemployment, not increasing them. Increased market demand for a good is associated with a decrease in the price of its complements, not an increase.  The question tests the understanding of macroeconomic relationships and potential bottlenecks to economic growth. The incorrect options represent common misconceptions in economics.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Policy                        Outcome/Effect
1. License Raj                             :   Promoted competition and entrepreneurship.
2. MRTP Act 1969                          :   Facilitated expansion of large business groups.
3. Reservation for small-scale industries  :   Enabled small firms to achieve economies of scale.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The License Raj actually hindered competition and entrepreneurship due to excessive regulation. The MRTP Act restricted the expansion of large business groups, not facilitated it.  Reservations for small-scale industries prevented them from achieving economies of scale due to limited production capacity and market access. The question assesses the understanding of the impact of specific Indian economic policies on industrial development. The incorrect options represent common misunderstandings of the historical context.



**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                      Description
1. Seigniorage                               :   Profit from money creation.
2. Functions of Money                        :   Acts as a store of value, a unit of account, and a medium of exchange.
3. Amrit Kaal                               :   25-year period leading up to India@100.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Seigniorage is indeed the profit a government or central bank earns from issuing currency. Money serves as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.  Amrit Kaal refers to the 25-year period leading up to India's 100th year of independence.  This question assesses a broad understanding of monetary policy and economic concepts, and knowledge of current Indian policy initiatives. All options are plausible, requiring precise knowledge to correctly match the terms with their descriptions.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Economic Reform                     Goal/Objective
1. Inclusive Growth                            :   Equitable distribution of growth benefits.
2.  Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) :   Promoting exports.
3.  Economic Liberalisation (1991)           :   Addressing external debt crisis.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Inclusive growth aims for equitable distribution of growth benefits. The 1991 economic liberalization was a direct response to the external debt crisis. Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) aimed to reduce reliance on imports, not to promote exports. The question tests the understanding of the objectives and outcomes of various Indian economic policies.  The distractors utilize related concepts to challenge candidates.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                   Related Term/Policy
1.  Hindu Rate of Growth                      :   India's economic growth rate in the 1950s and 1960s.
2. Green Revolution                          :   Faster agricultural growth in the mid-1960s.
3. National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005: Guaranteed wage employment for 100 days.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The "Hindu rate of growth" describes India's relatively slow economic growth rate in the decades after independence. The Green Revolution did lead to faster agricultural growth, significantly impacting poverty reduction. The NREGA 2005 aims to provide guaranteed wage employment for a minimum of 100 days a year. This question assesses knowledge of key terms and events in Indian economic history and their interrelationships. All options are plausible, requiring detailed knowledge to select the correct answer.



**13. Consider the following pairs:**

    Five-Year Plan Objective                    Associated Policy/Program
1. Growth with Equity                         :   Trickle-down economics.
2. Self-sufficiency                           :   Import substitution industrialization.
3. Poverty Alleviation                        :   National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Self-sufficiency was a major objective pursued through import substitution industrialization.  The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) is a direct measure aimed at poverty alleviation. However, "growth with equity" is not directly associated with "trickle-down economics" in the simplistic way implied. While trickle-down effects were anticipated, the objective was a more nuanced approach to equitable distribution of growth benefits. This question tests knowledge of Indian five-year plans, their objectives, and the policies implemented to achieve them.  The distractors challenge the candidate’s understanding of the complexities of economic policy.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Policy Feature                    Impact/Consequence
1.  Excessive government regulation           :   Increased efficiency of firms.
2. Protection from foreign competition         :   Incentivized improvement of domestic goods quality.
3. Inward-oriented policies                    :   Development of a strong export sector.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Excessive government regulation generally reduces efficiency, protection from foreign competition does not necessarily incentivize quality improvement, and inward-oriented policies tend to hinder the development of a strong export sector. This question tests the understanding of the impacts of various economic policy choices. The distractors present the opposite of the actual consequences to challenge candidates' understanding.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                       Associated Data/Name
1.  Hindu rate of growth                 :   3.5% growth rate in the 1960s and earlier
2.  Poverty Line (pre-independence)     :   Dadabhai Naoroji's "jail cost of living" calculation
3.  Author of 'Planning and the Poor'   :   D.R. Gadgil
4.  Growth Centre Approach               :   First Five Year Plan
5.  'Base year' in National Income     :   Reference year for price levels

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Hindu rate of growth" refers to the slow economic growth rate of approximately 3.5% experienced in India for several decades before the 1980s. Dadabhai Naoroji's pioneering work on poverty involved using the cost of living for prisoners as a benchmark for estimating poverty in pre-independent India.  Rudra Dutt is the author of 'Planning and the Poor'. The Growth Centre Approach was adopted under the Third Five Year Plan, not the First. The "base year" in national income accounting is a reference year used to adjust prices and calculate real GDP growth.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                    Description/Characteristic
1.  NNP                                  :   GNP minus Depreciation
2.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)      :   Compares prices of a basket of goods across countries
3.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)           :   Includes services, unlike the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
4.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   Increase indicates Rupee appreciation
5.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) : Increase indicates improved trade competitiveness


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NNP (Net National Product) is accurately calculated by subtracting depreciation from GNP (Gross National Product). Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates are indeed determined by comparing the prices of identical goods and services across different nations.  The CPI (Consumer Price Index) does encompass changes in service prices, which the WPI (Wholesale Price Index) does not.  An increase in NEER does signify Rupee appreciation. However, an increase in REER does *not* automatically indicate improved trade competitiveness; it depends on other factors as well, such as productivity and relative inflation rates.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy/Reform                 Impact/Characteristic
1.  1991 Economic Reforms              :   Significant increase in FDI inflows
2.  Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) :   Led to technological backwardness in Indian industry
3.  License Raj                           :   Created vested interests among politicians, bureaucrats, and industry
4.  Monopolistic & Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act :   Crippled private industry expansion
5.  WTO Membership for India             :   Increased India's share in world trade significantly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 1991 economic reforms in India did result in a substantial rise in FDI (Foreign Direct Investment). The ISI (Import Substitution Industrialization) policy, while initially aiming to boost domestic industries, ultimately hindered technological advancement due to protectionism. The License Raj, with its complex regulations, fostered corruption and created powerful vested interests. The MRTP (Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practices) Act significantly restricted the expansion of large private companies.  While WTO membership opened up Indian markets, the increase in India's share of global trade was not as dramatic or significant as suggested in option (d).


**4. With reference to India's Five-Year Plans, consider the following pairs:**

   Five-Year Plan                         Key Feature/Model
1.  First Five-Year Plan                  :   Mahalanobis Model
2.  Second Five-Year Plan                 :   Harrod-Domar Model
3.  Third Five-Year Plan                   :   Emphasis on self-reliance
4.  Seventh Five-Year Plan                :   Focus on "food, work, and productivity"
5.  Tenth Five-Year Plan                  :   Target of 8% GDP growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The First Five-Year Plan primarily focused on agriculture and utilized a different model than the Mahalanobis Model which was primarily used for the Second Five-Year Plan.  The Second Five-Year Plan primarily used the Harrod-Domar Model. The Third Five-Year Plan did indeed emphasize self-reliance and achieving a self-generating economy. The Seventh Plan rightly focused on improving food grain production, employment, and overall productivity.  The Tenth Plan did aim for 8% GDP growth, although it's important to note that it also included social development targets beyond just economic growth.


**5. With reference to government initiatives for startups and skill development in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Description/Focus
1.  Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Swaniyojan Yojana :   Rural startup initiative
2.  Atal Innovation Mission (AIM)            :   Fostering innovation across sectors
3.  Project Chunauti                         :   Seed funding for startups in Tier-II towns
4.  National Skill Development Mission      :   Three-tier structure (Central, State, District)
5.  ASEEM portal                            :   Mapping skilled workers with industry demands


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Swaniyojan Yojana is specifically designed to promote entrepreneurship in rural areas. The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) has a broad mandate to encourage innovation throughout the Indian economy. Project Chunauti provides seed funding and support to startups, particularly in smaller cities. The National Skill Development Mission operates with a three-tiered structure for effective implementation. The ASEEM portal is indeed a crucial tool for matching skilled individuals with available job opportunities, based on regional industry needs.  All the pairs are correctly matched.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Indian economic development, poverty, and human capital formation, drawing upon the factual data present in the source material. Note that some information in the source material is fragmented or incomplete, making the creation of perfectly matched pairs challenging.  Therefore, some questions focus more on identifying the correct pairing from plausible alternatives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Book Title                                      Author
1.  Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation :  Jean Dreze
2.  India's Development Experience: Selected Writings of S. Guhan :  S. Subramaniam (Ed.)
3.  The Political Economy of Hunger             :  Jean Dreze, Amartyya Sen, and Akhtar Husain (Eds.)
4.  Planned Economy for India                     :  M. Visvesvaraya


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text clearly identifies the authors of "Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation" as Amartya Sen and Jean Dreze, and  "India's Development Experience: Selected Writings of S. Guhan" as edited by S. Subramaniam.  The text also mentions "The Political Economy of Hunger" being edited by Jean Dreze, Amartyya Sen, and Akhtar Husain.  While the text mentions "Planned Economy for India," it does not explicitly state M. Visvesvaraya as the author. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are definitively correct. Option (d) is incorrect because the authorship of "Planned Economy for India" is not definitively established in the provided text. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**2. With reference to Indian Five-Year Plans, consider the following pairs:**

   Five-Year Plan                  Main Slogan/Emphasis
1. First Five-Year Plan             :   Removal of poverty (Garibi Hatao)
2. Second Five-Year Plan          :   Establishment of a socialistic pattern of society
3. Seventh Five-Year Plan          :   Food, Work, and Productivity
4. Eleventh Five-Year Plan         :   Faster, Sustainable, and More Inclusive Growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Second Five-Year Plan explicitly aimed at establishing a socialistic pattern of society. The Seventh Five-Year Plan's main slogan was "Food, Work, and Productivity." The Eleventh Five-Year Plan focused on "Faster and More Inclusive Growth," although the provided text mentions "Faster, Sustainable, and More Inclusive Growth" as the Twelfth Plan's emphasis.  The "Removal of Poverty" (Garibi Hatao) slogan is strongly associated with Indira Gandhi's rule but not specifically tied to the First Five-Year Plan in the provided text. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are accurately matched based on the provided information.  Option (a), (b), and (d) are thus incorrect due to the mismatching of the First Five Year Plan.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Report/Survey                    Key Focus/Topic
1. Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-2007)             :  Poverty alleviation programs
2. Economic Survey 2004-05                      :  Human Capital Formation
3. Economic Survey 2005-06                      :  Poverty estimation methodologies
4. Report of the Expert Group on Estimation of Proportion and Number of Poor  :   Estimation of poverty


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly mentions the Tenth Five-Year Plan's focus on poverty alleviation programs.  The text also indicates that the Report of the Expert Group directly addresses poverty estimation. The Economic Survey 2005-06 is mentioned in relation to poverty data.  However, the connection between the Economic Survey 2004-05 and Human Capital Formation is not explicitly stated in the given text. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are definitively correct based on the text. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy post-1991 liberalization, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                    Observed Change
1. Share of agriculture in GDP           :   Significant increase
2. FDI inflows                           :   Significant increase
3. India's foreign exchange reserves    :   Significant increase
4. Share of India's exports in world trade :   Significant decrease


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Post-1991 liberalization, FDI inflows and India's foreign exchange reserves did indeed significantly increase. However, the share of agriculture in GDP did not increase enormously; rather, it generally decreased as the service sector expanded.  Similarly, the text does not support a significant *decrease* in the share of India's exports in world trade, it implies an increase. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 accurately reflect the changes observed in the Indian economy after liberalization. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the inaccurate pairing of agriculture's share in GDP and/or  India's export share in world trade.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Economic Policy/Act                         Key Feature
1. License Raj                               :   Promoted competition and entrepreneurship
2. MRTP Act 1969                           :   Curbed monopolies and concentration of wealth
3. Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI):   Led to technological advancement and efficiency
4. National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005: Guaranteed wage employment for 100 days


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The MRTP Act aimed to curb monopolies and the concentration of wealth, and the NREGA 2005 guaranteed a minimum of 100 days of wage employment.  The License Raj is known for hindering competition and entrepreneurship, and ISI is criticized for leading to inefficiency and technological backwardness. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly pair the License Raj, MRTP Act, and/or ISI with their actual effects.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                                   Source
1. Net Domestic Product = Gross Domestic Product + Depreciation :  Chhattisgarh B.C.S. (Pre) 2020
2. Per Capita Income = Net Domestic Product/Total Population of the Nation :  Chhattisgarh B.C.S. (Pre) 2020
3. Net Domestic Product is a better metric than Gross Domestic Product for comparing world economies : Chhattisgarh B.C.S. (Pre) 2020
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Net Domestic Product (NDP) is calculated by subtracting depreciation from Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  Therefore, NDP = GDP - Depreciation. The statement presents the formula incorrectly.

Statement 2 is correct. Per capita income is a crucial economic indicator calculated by dividing the total national income (in this case, NDP) by the total population.  This provides an average income per person.

Statement 3 is a matter of debate and context. While NDP might be considered a better measure in some contexts (e.g., comparing economic output adjusted for capital consumption), GDP remains a widely used and significant indicator.  There's no universally accepted superiority of one over the other for all comparative economic analyses. Therefore, declaring NDP as definitively "better" is an oversimplification.  The statement is thus incorrect in its absolute assertion.

Option (b) is correct because only Statement 2 accurately reflects the relationship between the economic indicators.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Five-Year Plan                                   Characteristic
1. First Five-Year Plan                              : Based on the Harrod-Domar Model
2. Second Five-Year Plan                             :  Focussed on rapid industrialization of heavy and basic industries
3. Third Five-Year Plan                              :  Aimed to make India a self-reliant and self-generating economy
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  The First Five-Year Plan utilized the Harrod-Domar model, a growth model emphasizing capital accumulation and investment. The Second Five-Year Plan prioritized rapid industrialization, particularly in heavy and basic industries, reflecting Nehru's socialist leanings.  The Third Five-Year Plan aimed for economic self-reliance and self-sufficiency, a key goal of India's post-independence development strategy.  These are well-established facts in Indian economic history.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Indicator                           Description
1.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)               : Calculated using only the product method
2.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)               : Does not include the value of intermediate goods
3.  Net Domestic Product (NDP)                 :  Includes depreciation
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GDP can be calculated using multiple methods: the product (output) method, the income method, and the expenditure method.  The statement incorrectly restricts the calculation to a single method.

Statement 2 is correct.  GDP accounts for the final value of goods and services, excluding intermediate goods to avoid double-counting.  Intermediate goods are those used in the production process of final goods.

Statement 3 is incorrect. NDP is calculated by subtracting depreciation from GDP.  Therefore, NDP does *not* include depreciation; it *excludes* it.

Only statement 2 is correctly matched; hence, option (c) is the correct answer.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                         Role/Characteristic
1.  NITI Aayog                                  :  Replaced the Planning Commission
2.  National Development Council                 : Includes the Chairman of the Finance Commission
3.  Planning Commission                         : Formulated plans for the most effective and balanced utilization of resources
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission in 2015 as a part of India's economic reforms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chairman of the Finance Commission is not a member of the National Development Council (NDC).  The NDC comprises the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers, and other members.

Statement 3 is correct. The Planning Commission, which preceded NITI Aayog, was responsible for assessing resources, formulating plans, and determining priorities for India's economic development.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Program/Initiative                         Five-Year Plan
1. Integrated Rural Development Programme    : Sixth Five-Year Plan
2. Rural Literacy Development Programme      : Sixth Five-Year Plan
3.  Jawahar Rozgar Yojana                     : Seventh Five-Year Plan
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While the exact timing of program launches can sometimes be debated due to phased rollouts and variations in implementation across states,  the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) is widely associated with the Sixth Five-Year Plan.  However, the other two are not as clearly linked to specific plan periods in the same definitive manner as IRDP and Sixth Five Year Plan.  Therefore, only statement 1 is definitively correct.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Concept                            Description
1.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)              : Compares prices of same basket of goods in different countries
2.  Fiscal Stimulus                              : Massive government investment in manufacturing
3.  Value Added Tax (VAT)                       : Tax levied on final consumption only
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of a common basket of goods and services across different countries to account for variations in purchasing power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A fiscal stimulus is a broader strategy to boost economic activity, not limited to manufacturing investment alone.  It can involve various government actions, such as tax cuts, increased spending, or infrastructure projects.

Statement 3 is incorrect. VAT is a multi-stage tax levied on the value added at each stage of production and distribution, ultimately borne by the final consumer.  It is not solely a tax on final consumption.

Only statement 1 is correctly matched, making option (a) the correct answer.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                                  Definition
1. Seigniorage                                   : Profit from money creation
2.  Inflation Tax                                : Measured as the product of inflation rate and monetary base
3.  Capital Gains                               :  Increase in sales of a product
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Seigniorage accurately describes the profit a government or central bank earns from issuing currency.  The inflation tax is correctly defined as the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation, impacting the real value of money held by the public. This relates to the central bank's liability. However, capital gains arise from an increase in the *value* of an asset (like property or stocks), not from increased sales of a product.  Increased sales relate to revenue, not capital gains.  Only the first two pairs are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Program                                  Objective/Focus
1.  Aspirational District Programme               :  Focuses on poverty reduction
2.  Poshan Abhiyan                              : Aims to improve nutrition
3.  Atal Innovation Mission                    : Promotes skill development
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Aspirational District Programme aims to accelerate development in lagging districts, directly addressing poverty and inequality. Poshan Abhiyan, or the National Nutrition Mission, focuses on improving nutritional levels among children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. The Atal Innovation Mission promotes innovation and entrepreneurship, indirectly but significantly contributing to skill development and economic growth.  All three pairs accurately reflect the core objectives of the respective initiatives.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Reform Measure                       Impact
1. Removal of quantitative restrictions on imports : Increased international competition for domestic industries
2. Reduction in import duties on agricultural products : Increased costs for small and marginal farmers
3.  Disinvestment of Public Sector Units (PSUs)   :  Always resulted in substantial loss to the government
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Removing quantitative restrictions on imports leads to increased competition, impacting domestic industries. Reducing import duties on agricultural products can negatively affect domestic farmers, particularly small and marginal ones, by making imported goods cheaper. However, the disinvestment of PSUs has had mixed results; while some sales might have resulted in losses, others have been financially successful for the government, thereby making this statement incorrect.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are consistently and reliably matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                      Description
1. Import Substitution                           :  Replacing imports with domestic production
2.  Inward-looking trade strategy                 : Characterized by protectionism and restrictions on imports
3.  Regional equality                            :  Always achieved through tax benefits and lower electricity tariffs for industries in backward areas.
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Import substitution is accurately defined as the strategy of replacing imported goods with domestically produced ones. An inward-looking trade strategy is typically characterized by protectionist measures, including tariffs and quotas, to shield domestic industries from foreign competition. However, regional equality is a complex goal achieved through multiple policy instruments, not exclusively through tax benefits and lower electricity tariffs. Other factors such as infrastructure development and investment play a significant role.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are consistently and reliably matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                                  Description
1.  Mahalanobis Plan Model                         :   Aimed at curbing inflation in the economy
2.  Production Possibility Frontier                  :   Any point outside the frontier is attainable
3.  Price Elasticity of Demand                      :   Determined by the rate of income growth
4.  Money                                           :   Must have a higher value in alternative uses
5.  Adam Smith's "Invisible Hand"                   :   Government intervention in markets


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each one:

1. **Mahalanobis Plan Model:** This model focused on building heavy, capital-intensive industries, not primarily on curbing inflation. While inflation control might have been a secondary effect, the core aim was industrial development.

2. **Production Possibility Frontier (PPF):**  The PPF shows the maximum possible combinations of goods and services an economy can produce given its resources and technology. Any point *on* or *inside* the PPF is attainable; points *outside* are unattainable without improvements in technology or resource availability.

3. **Price Elasticity of Demand:** The magnitude of price elasticity is determined by factors such as the availability of substitutes, whether the good is a necessity or luxury, and its proportion in the consumer's budget. Income growth is not a direct determinant of price elasticity, although it might influence demand indirectly.

4. **Money:**  For something to be considered money, it must serve as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.  It does *not* need to have a higher value in alternative uses; in fact, its primary function is to facilitate exchange, not to be inherently valuable outside that context.

5. **Adam Smith's "Invisible Hand":** This concept refers to the self-regulating nature of the market, where individual self-interest unintentionally leads to beneficial outcomes for society as a whole. It's not about government intervention but rather the absence of it, allowing market forces to function freely.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                           Characteristic
1.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)     :   Increase indicates rupee depreciation
2.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)       :   Increase indicates improved trade competitiveness
3.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)                 :   Lower weight age of food compared to WPI
4.  Wholesale Price Index (WPI)               :   Captures changes in service prices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Again, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's examine each:

1. **NEER:** An increase in NEER signifies a *depreciation* of the rupee, not an appreciation.  A higher NEER means it takes more units of foreign currency to buy one unit of the domestic currency (rupee).

2. **REER:** An increase in REER indicates a *decrease*, not an improvement, in trade competitiveness.  A higher REER means domestic goods are relatively more expensive compared to foreign goods.

3. **CPI:** The CPI generally gives a *higher* weight age to food compared to the WPI because it reflects consumer spending patterns, where food constitutes a significant portion, especially for lower-income groups.

4. **WPI:** The WPI traditionally *does not* capture changes in service prices; the CPI does.  This is a key difference between the two indices.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy/Event                         Outcome
1.  Green Revolution                            :   Significant poverty reduction immediately
2.  License Raj                                  :   Promoted competition and entrepreneurship
3.  Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) :   Led to timely shift to export-oriented growth
4.  1991 Economic Reforms (LPG)               :   Slowdown in GDP growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs accurately reflect the outcomes. Here's why:

1. **Green Revolution:** While the Green Revolution significantly increased agricultural production, its impact on poverty reduction was not immediate and was unevenly distributed.  It benefited larger farmers more than smaller ones, exacerbating inequalities in some regions.

2. **License Raj:** The License Raj was characterized by excessive government control and regulations, hindering competition and entrepreneurship. It led to inefficiencies and stifled economic growth.

3. **ISI:** The ISI strategy initially helped develop India's industrial base but eventually led to inefficiencies and technological backwardness due to lack of competition and protection from global markets.  It did not facilitate a timely shift to export-oriented growth.

4. **1991 Reforms:** The 1991 reforms (LPG) aimed at liberalization, privatization, and globalization, leading to a significant increase in GDP growth, not a slowdown.  The reforms were intended to boost the economy, albeit with some initial challenges and adjustments.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                                   Definition
1.  Seigniorage                                      :   Profit from money creation through taxation
2.  Human Capital                                  :   Investment in physical resources like land
3.  Paradox of Thrift                               :   Increased saving leads to higher national savings
4.  Multiplier Effect                               :   Initial change in spending leads to a smaller change in output


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Once again, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's look at each one:

1. **Seigniorage:** Seigniorage is the profit a government or central bank makes from issuing currency. While inflation can be a factor, it's not solely through taxation. It's the difference between the face value of the currency and the cost of production.

2. **Human Capital:** Human capital refers to the skills, knowledge, and experience possessed by individuals that contribute to economic productivity. It's not about investment in physical resources.

3. **Paradox of Thrift:** The paradox of thrift demonstrates that increased individual saving can lead to a *decrease* in aggregate demand and thus lower overall savings.  This is because reduced spending can trigger a contractionary effect on the economy.

4. **Multiplier Effect:** The multiplier effect describes how an initial change in spending (e.g., government spending or investment) leads to a *larger* change in aggregate output due to the ripple effect through the economy.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Economic Plan/Model                       Characteristic
1.  Calcutta School (Mahalanobis Model)         :   Emphasis on wage goods and small-scale industries
2.  Bombay School (Vakil-Brahmanand Model)     :   Emphasis on heavy industries and capital goods
3.  Sarvodaya Plan                               :   Advocated for freedom from foreign technology
4.  People's Plan                                :   Prioritized agricultural production


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Let's examine each:

1. **Calcutta School:** This model prioritized the development of heavy industries and capital goods, not wage goods and small-scale industries. That was the focus of the Bombay School.

2. **Bombay School:** This model emphasized the production of wage goods (consumer goods) and small-scale industries to utilize surplus labor, unlike the Calcutta School's focus on capital-intensive industries.

3. **Sarvodaya Plan:** This plan indeed emphasized small and cottage industries, along with agriculture, and advocated for self-reliance and minimizing dependence on foreign technology.

4. **People's Plan:** This plan correctly gave the highest priority to agricultural production, aiming to improve the rural economy and alleviate poverty through increased food production.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept                      Description
1. Marginal Revenue                     : Diminishes with increased output in a perfectly competitive market
2. Average Revenue                      : Perfectly elastic for a perfectly competitive firm
3. Marginal Product                     : Diminishes according to the law of diminishing returns
4. Price Elasticity of Demand           : Zero when quantity demanded remains unchanged despite price changes
5. Slope of Aggregate Consumption Curve : Positive in Simple Keynesian theory


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because all the pairs (1, 3, 4, and 5) accurately reflect the economic concepts.

1. **Marginal Revenue:** In a perfectly competitive market, as a firm increases its output, the price it can charge remains constant (due to perfect competition).  Therefore, the increase in total revenue from selling one more unit (marginal revenue) will eventually diminish as the firm produces more. This is a fundamental concept in microeconomics.

2. **Average Revenue:** For a perfectly competitive firm, the average revenue (price per unit) is constant and equal to the marginal revenue. The firm is a price taker, meaning it cannot influence the market price.  Its average revenue curve is a horizontal line, representing perfect elasticity.

3. **Marginal Product:**  The law of diminishing marginal returns states that as you add more of a variable input (like labor) to a fixed input (like capital), the additional output produced by each additional unit of the variable input will eventually decline. This is a cornerstone of production theory.

4. **Price Elasticity of Demand:**  Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price. Zero price elasticity indicates that the quantity demanded is completely unresponsive to price changes.  This is an extreme case, often observed with essential goods or those with very few close substitutes.

5. **Slope of Aggregate Consumption Curve:** In the Simple Keynesian model, the aggregate consumption curve depicts the relationship between aggregate income and aggregate consumption.  The curve has a positive slope, reflecting the positive relationship between income and consumption—as income rises, so does consumption.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.  A comprehensive understanding of micro and macroeconomic principles is essential to correctly match all the pairs.  The distractors in the incorrect options test the candidate's knowledge of specific aspects of these principles.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator                 Characteristic
1. Trade Deficit                      : Occurs when imports exceed exports
2. Trade Surplus                      : Associated with levels of income below equilibrium
3. Multiplier Effect                   : Smaller in open economies compared to closed economies
4. Nominal Exchange Rate              : Price of one unit of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency
5. Real Exchange Rate                 : Measures international competitiveness


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately matches the economic indicators with their characteristics. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Trade Deficit:** A trade deficit is a fundamental macroeconomic concept. It arises when a country's imports of goods and services exceed its exports.  This leads to a net outflow of funds from the country.

2. **Trade Surplus:** While a trade surplus (exports exceeding imports) *can* be associated with below-equilibrium income levels (due to reduced import demand), this is not always the case. A trade surplus can occur due to various factors, including high competitiveness, strong export demand, or policy interventions. The statement is an oversimplification and therefore inaccurate.

3. **Multiplier Effect:** The multiplier effect is a key concept in Keynesian economics. In open economies, a portion of increased demand spills over to imports, reducing the impact on domestic output. The multiplier is smaller in open economies than in closed economies because of this leakage.

4. **Nominal Exchange Rate:** The nominal exchange rate is simply the rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another. It's a direct measure of currency values in the foreign exchange market.

5. **Real Exchange Rate:** The real exchange rate is more complex than the nominal rate. It adjusts the nominal exchange rate for differences in price levels between countries. It is a crucial indicator of a country's international competitiveness, as it reflects the relative prices of its goods and services compared to those of other countries.


Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs. Understanding the nuances of macroeconomic indicators and their interrelationships is critical for selecting the correct option.  The distractors in the incorrect options test the candidate's depth of understanding of these concepts.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Macroeconomic Concept              Explanation
1. Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) : Fraction of additional income spent on consumption
2. Ex Ante Investment                  : Planned investment by firms
3. Ex Post Investment                   : Actual investment, including unintended inventory changes
4. Parametric Shift of a Line          : Change in slope or intercept of a line in a graph
5. Effective Demand Principle          : Output determined by aggregate demand when aggregate supply is perfectly elastic


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer as all five pairs accurately reflect the macroeconomic concepts. Let's examine each:

1. **MPC:** The MPC is a crucial concept in Keynesian economics. It represents the proportion of an increase in income that households will spend on consumption goods and services. A higher MPC implies a stronger multiplier effect.

2. **Ex Ante Investment:**  This refers to the planned or intended investment by firms during a specific period. It is a forward-looking concept, representing the investment decisions made based on anticipated economic conditions.

3. **Ex Post Investment:** This is the actual investment that occurs during a period. It may differ from ex ante investment due to unforeseen circumstances, like changes in demand leading to unintended inventory adjustments.

4. **Parametric Shift:** In economic models represented graphically, a parametric shift occurs when a parameter (a constant or coefficient in an equation) changes, causing the curve or line to shift its position. This represents a change in the underlying economic relationship.

5. **Effective Demand Principle:**  This principle states that in the short run, when the aggregate supply of goods and services is perfectly elastic (meaning firms can supply any quantity demanded at a given price level), the level of output is determined solely by the level of aggregate demand.


Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  A thorough understanding of basic macroeconomic concepts and their graphical representations is necessary to answer this question correctly. The distractors in the incorrect options test the candidate's knowledge of these fundamentals and the ability to differentiate between planned and actual values in macroeconomic variables.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Budget Component          Description
1. Revenue Budget                     : Shows current government receipts and expenditures
2. Capital Budget                    : Includes expenditures on creation of physical or financial assets
3. Tax Revenue                        : Consists of direct and indirect taxes levied by the government
4. Non-tax Revenue                    : Includes interest receipts, dividends, and fees for services
5. Revenue Expenditure                 : Expenditures not resulting in the creation of assets


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because all the pairs accurately define components of a government budget. Let's break down each one:

1. **Revenue Budget:** The revenue budget captures the government's current income (receipts) and how it's spent.  It focuses on the day-to-day operations of the government.

2. **Capital Budget:** This part of the budget outlines expenditures that lead to the creation of assets, such as infrastructure projects, investments in public enterprises, or loan disbursements.  It's about long-term investments.

3. **Tax Revenue:** This is a major source of government revenue, comprising direct taxes (like income tax) and indirect taxes (like GST).  The structure of taxation significantly impacts income distribution and economic activity.

4. **Non-tax Revenue:**  This includes revenue sources other than taxes, such as interest earned on government investments, fees from services provided by government agencies, and grants from international organizations.

5. **Revenue Expenditure:** This type of expenditure doesn't create assets. It covers recurring costs like salaries of government employees, subsidies, interest payments on loans, and defense spending.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of government budgeting.  The distractors in the incorrect options test the candidate's knowledge of specific revenue and expenditure categories within government finance.  A strong grasp of public finance is crucial for answering this correctly.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Monetary Policy Concept             Description
1. Seigniorage                          : Profit from money creation
2. Medium of Exchange                  : Primary function of money to facilitate transactions
3. Unit of Account                      : Money serves as a standard for valuing goods and services
4. Store of Value                       : Money can retain its value over time
5. Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)            : Fraction of deposits banks must keep with the central bank


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because all five pairs accurately describe monetary policy concepts.  Let's analyze each:

1. **Seigniorage:** This is the profit a government makes from issuing currency. It represents the difference between the face value of money issued and the cost of its production.  It's a crucial source of government revenue, but excessive seigniorage can be inflationary.

2. **Medium of Exchange:** Money's most important function is to facilitate transactions.  It eliminates the need for barter and significantly improves the efficiency of markets.

3. **Unit of Account:** Money provides a common unit for measuring the value of goods, services, and assets.  This makes economic comparisons and calculations much easier.

4. **Store of Value:** Money acts as a store of value, although its value can be eroded by inflation.  The extent to which it retains its value is a significant concern in macroeconomic management.

5. **CRR:** The CRR is a crucial monetary policy tool.  By mandating a minimum percentage of deposits banks must hold with the central bank, the CRR influences the money supply and credit availability in the economy.


Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.  A comprehensive understanding of the functions of money and the tools of monetary policy is crucial for a correct answer. The distractors in the incorrect options test the candidate's knowledge of these core concepts and their applications in macroeconomic management.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Macroeconomic Variable         Definition/Calculation

1. Personal Disposable Income  :  Private Income - Taxes
2. Net National Product (NNP) at market price : GNP - Depreciation
3. Nominal GDP                  : GDP evaluated at a set of constant prices
4. Personal Income (PI)        : Undistributed profits + net interest payments made by households + transfer payments to the households from the government and firms
5. Real GDP                     : GDP evaluated at current market prices

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Net National Product (NNP) at market price is indeed calculated by subtracting depreciation from Gross National Product (GNP).  Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

* **1. Personal Disposable Income:**  Personal Disposable Income (PDI) is calculated as Personal Income (PI) minus Personal tax payments and Non-tax payments. The given definition in option 1 is incorrect.

* **3. Nominal GDP:** Nominal GDP is the value of GDP at current market prices, not at constant prices. Real GDP is calculated using constant prices to adjust for inflation. The given definition in option 3 is reversed.

* **4. Personal Income (PI):** The formula for Personal Income (PI) involves subtracting undistributed profits, net interest payments made by households, and corporate tax from National Income (NI), and then adding transfer payments from the government and firms.  Option 4 provides an incorrect formula.

* **5. Real GDP:**  As mentioned earlier, Real GDP uses constant prices, unlike the definition given in option 5.


Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the correct definition/calculation, making (b) the correct answer.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of macroeconomic concepts.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator           Description

1. GDP Deflator                : Ratio of Real GDP to Nominal GDP
2. Consumer Price Index (CPI) : Index of prices of a given basket of commodities bought by the representative consumer
3. Wholesale Price Index (WPI): Index of prices of goods traded in bulk, also known as Producer Price Index (PPI) in the USA
4. Real Exchange Rate          : Number of units of domestic currency one must give up to get a unit of foreign currency
5. Nominal Exchange Rate      : Relative price of foreign goods in terms of domestic goods

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Let's examine each:

* **2. Consumer Price Index (CPI):** This definition accurately describes the CPI.  It measures the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.

* **3. Wholesale Price Index (WPI):** The description correctly defines the WPI and its equivalence to the PPI in the USA. It tracks changes in the price of goods at the wholesale level.

* **5. Nominal Exchange Rate:** This correctly defines the nominal exchange rate as the price of one unit of foreign currency in terms of the domestic currency.

Now, let's look at why the other pairs are incorrect:

* **1. GDP Deflator:** The GDP deflator is calculated as the ratio of Nominal GDP to Real GDP, not the other way around as stated.  This is a common point of confusion.

* **4. Real Exchange Rate:** The real exchange rate is the relative price of foreign goods in terms of domestic goods, considering the nominal exchange rate and price levels in both countries.  It is not simply the price of foreign currency as stated.


Therefore, the correct answer is (d), showcasing understanding of economic indicators and their calculations.  The incorrect options provide plausible but false definitions, testing the candidate's in-depth knowledge.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Aggregate Income Category       Components

1. National Disposable Income  : Net National Product at market prices + Other current transfers from the rest of the world
2. Private Income               : Factor income from net domestic product accruing to the private sector + National debt interest + Net factor income from abroad + Current transfers from government + Other net transfers from the rest of the world
3. Personal Income (PI)         : National Disposable Income - Undistributed profits - Net interest payments made by households - Corporate tax + Transfer payments to households from the government and firms
4. Personal Disposable Income (PDI) : PI - Personal tax payments - Non-tax payments
5. Net National Product (NNP) at factor cost : NNP at market prices + (Indirect taxes - Subsidies)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

* **1. National Disposable Income:** The definition accurately reflects the components of National Disposable Income, including net national product and current transfers from abroad.

* **2. Private Income:** This definition accurately describes the components of private income, encompassing various sources of income accruing to the private sector.

* **4. Personal Disposable Income (PDI):** This correctly defines PDI as Personal Income (PI) less personal and non-tax payments.

Now let's examine why the other pairs are incorrect:

* **3. Personal Income (PI):**  Personal income is derived from National Income (NI), not National Disposable Income.  The formula in option 3 is therefore incorrect.

* **5. Net National Product (NNP) at factor cost:** NNP at factor cost is calculated by subtracting net indirect taxes (indirect taxes minus subsidies) from NNP at market prices. Option 5 incorrectly adds net indirect taxes.

Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct option. This question tests the candidate's understanding of different aggregate income categories and their constituent components within the national income accounting framework.  The incorrect options provide plausible but inaccurate formulations, demanding precise knowledge.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Macroeconomic Concept       Description

1. Paradox of Thrift         : If people save more, aggregate savings in the economy decrease
2. Open Market Operation     : Purchase or sale of government securities by the central bank to influence money supply
3. Multiplier Effect          : An increase in autonomous spending leads to a proportionally larger increase in aggregate output
4. Revenue Deficit             : Excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts
5. Ricardian Equivalence     : Consumers anticipate future tax increases to repay government debt and adjust consumption accordingly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are correctly matched. Let's examine each:

* **1. Paradox of Thrift:** This accurately describes the paradox—increased individual saving can lead to decreased aggregate saving due to reduced aggregate demand and output.

* **2. Open Market Operation:** This definition correctly explains the central bank's use of open market operations to manage money supply.

* **3. Multiplier Effect:**  This correctly describes the multiplier effect, where an initial change in spending has a magnified impact on overall output.

* **4. Revenue Deficit:** This accurately defines a revenue deficit as the excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts.

* **5. Ricardian Equivalence:** This correctly explains the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis, where consumers anticipate future tax implications of current government borrowing and adjust their spending accordingly.

Therefore, the correct answer is (c). This question assesses the candidate's understanding of key macroeconomic concepts and their implications. The comprehensive nature of the question and the inclusion of all correct pairs make it a challenging yet rewarding question for assessing a candidate's knowledge.  There are no incorrect pairs to act as distractors; all are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Fiscal Policy Measure       Effect on Equilibrium Income

1. Increase in Government Purchases (G): Equilibrium income increases by a multiple of the increase in G
2. Decrease in Lump-Sum Taxes (T) : Equilibrium income increases by a multiple of the decrease in T, but less than the increase from a G increase
3. Decrease in Proportional Taxes (tY) : Equilibrium income increases by a multiple of the decrease in taxes, with the multiplier affected by the tax rate (t)
4. Balanced Budget Increase (equal increase in G and T): Equilibrium income remains unchanged
5. Increase in Lump-Sum Taxes (T) : Equilibrium income decreases by a multiple of the increase in T, but less than the decrease from a G decrease


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Let's examine each:

* **1. Increase in Government Purchases (G):** An increase in government spending directly boosts aggregate demand, leading to a multiple increase in equilibrium income due to the multiplier effect.

* **2. Decrease in Lump-Sum Taxes (T):** A decrease in lump-sum taxes raises disposable income, increasing consumption and thus equilibrium income. However, the increase is smaller compared to an equivalent increase in government spending.

* **3. Decrease in Proportional Taxes (tY):** Similar to lump-sum tax cuts, decreasing proportional taxes increases disposable income and stimulates consumption, but the multiplier effect is moderated by the tax rate.

* **5. Increase in Lump-Sum Taxes (T):** Increasing lump-sum taxes reduces disposable income, decreasing consumption and leading to a multiple decrease in equilibrium income.  The decrease is less than an equivalent decrease in government spending.

Now, let's address why pair 4 is incorrect:

* **4. Balanced Budget Increase (equal increase in G and T):** A balanced budget increase (equal increases in government spending and taxes) leads to an increase in equilibrium income equal to the increase in government spending.  The statement that equilibrium income remains unchanged is incorrect.  The balanced budget multiplier is 1, not 0.

Therefore, the correct answer is (c). This question tests the candidate's understanding of fiscal policy tools and their impacts on national income. The inclusion of the balanced budget multiplier as a distractor adds complexity, demanding a thorough understanding of fiscal policy mechanics.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Good                         Example
1. Durable Consumption Good           :   Tractor
2. Non-Durable Consumption Good       :   Cosmetics
3. Intermediate Good                   :   Steel sheets
4. Capital Good                         :   Washing machine used in a laundry
5. Final Good                           : Tea leaves purchased for home consumption

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A tractor is a capital good, not a durable consumption good.  Durable consumption goods are those used by consumers and have a lifespan of more than three years (e.g., refrigerators, furniture). Cosmetics are indeed non-durable consumption goods, consumed relatively quickly. Steel sheets are intermediate goods; they are further processed into final goods. A washing machine used in a laundry is a capital good; it aids in the production of a service (laundry). Tea leaves bought for home use are a final good; they are not used in further production.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (c) accurately reflects the correct classification of goods based on their usage and economic function.  Understanding the differences between consumption, capital, intermediate, and final goods is crucial for comprehending macroeconomic concepts like GDP calculation and investment analysis.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Factor of Production              Return
1. Entrepreneur                      :   Rent
2. Capital                           :   Wages
3. Natural Resources                 :   Interest
4. Labour                            :   Profit

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.  The return to entrepreneurship is profit, not rent.  Capital earns interest, not wages. Natural resources yield rent, not interest. Labour receives wages, not profit.  This question tests the fundamental understanding of the factors of production and their corresponding returns in economics.  A thorough grasp of these concepts is essential for analyzing production processes, income distribution, and the overall functioning of an economy. The incorrect matching in all pairs highlights the importance of accurate association of factors with their respective returns.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                     Description
1. Marginal Propensity to Consume     :   The proportion of income saved
2. Paradox of Thrift                    :  Increased saving leads to decreased aggregate demand
3. Autonomous Expenditure Multiplier :   The ratio of change in equilibrium output to the initial change in autonomous spending

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the proportion of an increase in income that is spent on consumption, not saved.  The paradox of thrift accurately describes the situation where increased individual saving reduces aggregate demand, potentially leading to lower overall savings. The autonomous expenditure multiplier correctly defines the relationship between a change in autonomous spending and the resulting change in equilibrium output.  Option (a) is incorrect because the description of MPC is wrong. Option (c) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched definition of MPC.  Understanding these macroeconomic concepts is critical for analyzing fiscal policy, economic growth, and the overall stability of an economy.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Macroeconomic Variable             Definition
1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)      :   The total income earned by residents of a country
2. Gross National Product (GNP)      :   The total value of final goods and services produced within a country’s borders
3. Net National Product (NNP)        :   GNP minus depreciation
4. National Disposable Income         :   NNP at market prices minus net indirect taxes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

GDP measures the total value of final goods and services produced within a country's borders, not the income of residents. GNP includes income earned by residents both domestically and abroad, making option 1 incorrect. NNP is correctly defined as GNP minus depreciation. National disposable income is Net National Income at factor cost plus net factor income from abroad plus net current transfers from rest of the world, making option 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question assesses the understanding of key macroeconomic variables and their definitions.  Accurate definitions are fundamental for interpreting economic data and analyzing economic performance.  The incorrect matching in options (b), (c), and (d) highlights the importance of precise definitions in macroeconomics.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Method of GDP Calculation        Description
1. Product Method                    :   Sums up the expenditures of all sectors
2. Expenditure Method                :   Adds up the value added at each stage of production
3. Income Method                     :   Totals the factor incomes earned in the production process

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The product method, also known as the value-added method, calculates GDP by summing up the value added at each stage of production, making option 1 incorrect. The expenditure method sums up the total spending on final goods and services by different sectors, making option 2 incorrect. The income method correctly calculates GDP by adding up all factor incomes (wages, rent, interest, and profit) generated in the production process.  Option (a) is incorrect as it incorrectly describes the product method. Option (b) is incorrect as it incorrectly describes both the product and expenditure methods. Option (d) is incorrect as it incorrectly describes the product and expenditure methods.  Understanding the different methods of calculating GDP is crucial for analyzing economic activity and drawing accurate conclusions about economic growth.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Function               Description
1. Allocation Function               :   Redistributes income through taxation and transfer payments
2. Distribution Function            :   Provides public goods like national defense and roads
3. Stabilization Function           :   Manages economic fluctuations through fiscal and monetary policies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The allocation function of the government involves providing public goods, not redistributing income. The distribution function focuses on income redistribution, not on providing public goods. The stabilization function correctly aims at managing economic fluctuations through policy interventions.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question assesses understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the government in a mixed economy.  A clear understanding of these functions is essential for evaluating government policies and their impact on the economy. The incorrect matching in pair 1 highlights the importance of distinguishing between the different functions of the government.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Tax                       Example
1. Direct Tax                        :   Excise duty
2. Indirect Tax                      :   Goods and Services Tax (GST)
3. Progressive Tax                   :   Tax on corporate profits
4. Proportional Tax                  :   Personal income tax

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Excise duty is an indirect tax, not a direct tax. GST is an indirect tax, correctly matched. Tax on corporate profits is a proportional tax, not a progressive tax. Personal income tax can be progressive, proportional or regressive depending on the tax slabs.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of different types of taxes and their examples.  Understanding the characteristics of different taxes is important for analyzing tax policies and their effects on income distribution and economic activity.  The incorrect matching in pairs 1, 3, and 4 emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between different tax systems.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Money Supply Component            Description
1. Currency in Circulation           :   Deposits held by commercial banks with the central bank
2. Demand Deposits                   :   Notes and coins held by the public
3. Reserve Money                     :   Demand deposits held by the public and other deposits

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Currency in circulation refers to notes and coins held by the public, making option 1 incorrect. Demand deposits are deposits held by the public with commercial banks, making option 2 incorrect. Reserve money includes currency in circulation and banks’ reserves with the central bank, making option 3 incorrect.  This question tests the understanding of the components of money supply.  A clear understanding of these components is crucial for analyzing monetary policy and its impact on the economy. The incorrect matching in all pairs highlights the importance of accurate definitions of money supply components.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                     Description
1.  Opportunity Cost                    :   Out of pocket cost plus cost incurred by the Government
2.  Price Mechanism in a free market   :   Determination of the inflation rate in the economy
3.  Economic Models                     :   Can be expressed only through equations
4.  Normal Demand Curve Slope          :   Positive
5.  Price Floor Example                  :   Maximum Retail Price (MRP) printed on the covers/packets of goods sold in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Opportunity Cost:** The correct description is "Value of the next best alternative that is given up."  The option provided incorrectly adds government costs, which is not a standard definition of opportunity cost in economics.  Opportunity cost focuses on the value of the best alternative forgone, irrespective of government involvement.

2. **Price Mechanism:** The price mechanism in a free market economy refers to "The interplay of the forces of demand and supply." Inflation rate determination is a macroeconomic concept, while the price mechanism is a microeconomic concept explaining price adjustments through market forces.  While related, they are distinct.

3. **Economic Models:** Economic models "involve simplification of complex processes" and "represent the whole or a part of a theory." They can be expressed through equations, diagrams, or narratives. The statement that they *can only* be expressed through equations is incorrect.

4. **Normal Demand Curve Slope:** A normal demand curve has a "negative" slope, indicating an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.  A positive slope would represent a Giffen good, which is an exception rather than the norm.

5. **Price Floor:** A price floor is a minimum price set by the government.  A minimum support price (MSP) for a commodity like Jowar is a classic example. The MRP is a maximum retail price, not a floor.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Statement                    Validity
1.  When total utility is maximum, marginal utility is zero : Correct
2.  When total utility is decreasing, marginal utility is positive : Incorrect
3.  When total utility is increasing, marginal utility is negative : Incorrect


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Only the first statement is correctly matched. Let's analyze each statement:

1. **Maximum Total Utility and Marginal Utility:**  When total utility is maximized, the marginal utility (the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit) becomes zero. This is a fundamental concept in consumer theory.  Adding another unit will not increase total utility.

2. **Decreasing Total Utility and Marginal Utility:** When total utility is decreasing, the marginal utility is negative. This means consuming an additional unit reduces overall satisfaction. The statement claims it's positive, which is incorrect.

3. **Increasing Total Utility and Marginal Utility:** When total utility is increasing, the marginal utility is positive, but diminishing.  The statement that marginal utility is negative when total utility is increasing is fundamentally wrong.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Macroeconomic Variable                    Description
1.  Trade Deficit                             :   Exports exceed imports
2.  Multiplier Effect in an Open Economy     :   Larger than in a closed economy
3.  Increase in Foreign Income                :   Reduces domestic exports
4.  Effect of Domestic Price Decrease        :   Decreases domestic exports
5.  Currency Appreciation                     :   Increases net exports


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's examine each one:

1. **Trade Deficit:** A trade deficit occurs when imports exceed exports, leading to a net outflow of funds. The given description is the opposite – a trade *surplus*.

2. **Multiplier Effect:** In an open economy, the multiplier effect is *smaller* than in a closed economy due to leakages from imports.  A portion of increased spending goes towards foreign goods, reducing the impact on domestic output.

3. **Increase in Foreign Income:** An increase in foreign income leads to *increased* domestic exports as foreign demand rises.  The statement incorrectly suggests a reduction in exports.

4. **Domestic Price Decrease:** A decrease in domestic prices makes domestic goods more competitive internationally, thus *increasing* domestic exports.  The description states the opposite effect.

5. **Currency Appreciation:** Currency appreciation makes domestic goods more expensive for foreign buyers and foreign goods cheaper for domestic buyers, leading to a *reduction* in net exports. The statement claims an increase.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Macroeconomic Identity                      Equation
1.  National Saving                              :   S = I + NX
2.  Government Saving                           :   S = Y - C - G
3.  Relationship between Private, Government & National Saving: S = S<sup>p</sup> + S<sup>g</sup>
4.  Current Account Balance                     : Synonymous with Trade Balance (ignoring invisibles and transfers)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Let's analyze each:

1. **National Saving:**  The identity S = I + NX (National Saving equals Investment plus Net Exports) accurately reflects the relationship in an open economy.  Savings are used to finance investment and any trade surplus or deficit.

2. **Government Saving:** The equation S = Y - C - G (National Saving equals Income minus Consumption minus Government Spending) is incorrect as it represents National Saving, not specifically Government Saving.  Government saving is represented by (T-G), where T is tax revenue.

3. **Relationship between Savings:** The identity S = S<sup>p</sup> + S<sup>g</sup> (National Saving equals Private Saving plus Government Saving) correctly expresses the components of national saving.

4. **Current Account Balance:** In the simplified model presented, the current account balance is treated as synonymous with the trade balance, ignoring invisible transactions (like services) and transfer payments. This is a simplification, but a valid one for the context of the provided text.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Macroeconomic Concept                      Explanation
1.  Effective Demand Principle              :   Aggregate output is determined by aggregate supply
2.  Autonomous Expenditure Multiplier        :   Measures the change in aggregate demand due to a change in autonomous spending
3.  Parametric Shift                           :   A change in the slope or intercept of a line
4.  Paradox of Thrift                         :   Increased saving leads to increased aggregate demand


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

1. **Effective Demand Principle:** This principle states that aggregate output is determined by the level of *aggregate demand*, not aggregate supply, under the assumption of perfectly elastic aggregate supply at a given price level.

2. **Autonomous Expenditure Multiplier:** This correctly describes the multiplier's function. It captures the amplified effect of changes in autonomous spending (spending not influenced by income) on aggregate demand.

3. **Parametric Shift:** This definition accurately explains a parametric shift in the context of economic models.  It's a change in the parameters of a model (slope or intercept) causing a shift in the line.

4. **Paradox of Thrift:** The paradox states that increased individual saving leads to *reduced* aggregate demand, not increased. This is because reduced consumption offsets the increased saving, potentially resulting in lower overall economic activity.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Exchange Rate Concept                       Description
1. Nominal Exchange Rate                       :  Relative price of foreign goods in terms of domestic goods
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate                :  Price of one unit of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency
3. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)               :  When the nominal and real exchange rates are equal
4. Pegged Exchange Rate                         :  Market-determined without central bank intervention
5. Clean Floating Exchange Rate                  :  Exchange rate is a policy variable and may be changed by official action

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's break down each one:

1. **Nominal Exchange Rate:** This is the price of one unit of foreign currency in terms of the domestic currency. The description given is actually the definition of the *real* exchange rate.

2. **Real Effective Exchange Rate:** This is an index reflecting the average exchange rate of a currency against a basket of other currencies, adjusted for inflation differences.  It is *not* simply the price of one unit of a foreign currency.

3. **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):** PPP is a theory suggesting that exchange rates should adjust to equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. It does *not* mean the nominal and real exchange rates are simply equal; there are other factors involved.

4. **Pegged Exchange Rate:** This is a fixed exchange rate system where the value of a currency is pegged to another currency or a commodity.  It is *not* market-determined without intervention.

5. **Clean Floating Exchange Rate:** This is a system where exchange rates are determined purely by market forces without central bank intervention.  The described characteristic is of a *pegged* or *managed* floating exchange rate.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Indian Economic Indicator                    Characteristic
1.  Increase in NEER                             :   Indicates depreciation of the Rupee
2.  Increase in REER                             :   Indicates improvement in trade competitiveness
3.  Increasing divergence between NEER and REER:   Caused by a decreasing trend in domestic inflation relative to other countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

1. **NEER (Nominal Effective Exchange Rate):** An increase in NEER indicates *appreciation* of the Rupee, not depreciation.  A higher NEER means the Rupee is stronger relative to a basket of other currencies.

2. **REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate):** An increase in REER indicates a *worsening*, not an improvement, in trade competitiveness. A higher REER suggests domestic goods are relatively more expensive compared to foreign goods.

3. **Divergence between NEER and REER:**  Increasing divergence is likely caused by an *increasing* trend in domestic inflation relative to other countries.  If domestic inflation rises faster, the REER will increase more than the NEER, leading to greater divergence.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Method of GDP Calculation                 Description
1. Expenditure Method                         :   Measures aggregate annual value of goods and services
2. Product Method (Value Added)              :   Measures total factor payments
3. Income Method                              :   Measures aggregate value of spending on final goods and services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

1. **Expenditure Method:** This method sums up all final expenditures in the economy (consumption, investment, government spending, net exports) to arrive at GDP. It does *not* measure the aggregate annual value of *all* goods and services (including intermediate goods).

2. **Product Method (Value Added):** This method adds up the value added at each stage of production across all sectors of the economy. It does *not* measure total factor payments; that’s the income method.

3. **Income Method:** This method adds up all the incomes earned in the economy (wages, salaries, profits, rents, interest) to calculate GDP. It does *not* measure the aggregate value of spending on final goods.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Concept                       Description
1.  Capital Output Ratio                     :   Measures how much capital is required per unit of output
2.  Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR) :   Measures the average efficiency of capital
3.  Productivity                             :   Output per unit of input


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.

1. **Capital Output Ratio:** This correctly describes the capital-output ratio as a measure of the capital required to produce a unit of output.  A higher ratio suggests lower capital efficiency.

2. **ICOR (Incremental Capital Output Ratio):** This measures the additional capital needed to produce one additional unit of output. It reflects the efficiency of *new* investments, not average capital efficiency.  The description of average capital efficiency is more suitable for the capital-output ratio.

3. **Productivity:** This definition accurately describes productivity as output per unit of input (labor, capital, etc.).


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Indian Economic Data                     Description
1.  GDP at Current Market Prices             :   GDP at constant market prices
2.  GDP at Constant Market Prices           :   Measures economic growth in India
3.  Per Capita GDP                           :   GDP divided by population


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

1. **GDP at Current Market Prices:** This represents GDP using current year prices. It is *not* at constant prices. GDP at constant market prices (or real GDP) uses base-year prices to isolate the impact of quantity changes on economic growth.

2. **GDP at Constant Market Prices:** In India, economic growth is measured by real GDP, which is GDP at constant market prices. It isolates the impact of quantity changes in production, removing the effect of price fluctuations.

3. **Per Capita GDP:** This is correctly defined as GDP divided by the population.  It provides a measure of GDP per person.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Indian economic development, poverty, and human capital formation, drawing upon names, organizations, and publications mentioned in the text.  Note that the difficulty is intentionally high, requiring precise recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Book/Publication                                   Author/Editor
1.  *Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation* :  Jean Dreze
2.  *Everybody Loves a Good Drought: Stories from India’s Poorest Districts* :  P. Sainath
3. *India’s Development Experience: Selected Writings of S. Guhan* :  V.M. Dandekar
4. *Poverty in India*                                   :  B.S. Minhas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Amartya Sen is the author of *Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation*.  P. Sainath authored *Everybody Loves a Good Drought: Stories from India’s Poorest Districts*.  S. Subramanian edited *India’s Development Experience: Selected Writings of S. Guhan*.  B.S. Minhas, along with others, contributed to articles and reports on poverty in India, but isn't solely associated with a book titled *Poverty in India*.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge. The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between authors and editors.



**2. With reference to Indian Economic Development, consider the following pairs:**

   Government Report/Publication                   Ministry/Organization
1.  Economic Survey 2004-05                         : Planning Commission
2.  Tenth Five Year Plan 2002-2007, Vol. II        : Ministry of Finance
3. Report of the Expert Group on Estimation of Proportion and Number of Poor : Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
4. Economic Survey 2005-06                         :  Reserve Bank of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Economic Survey 2004-05 is published by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India. The Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-2007) was formulated by the Planning Commission. The report on the estimation of the proportion and number of poor was a Planning Commission publication.  The Reserve Bank of India does not typically publish economic surveys. This question tests knowledge of Indian government publications and their associated ministries.  The distractors are designed to be plausible based on the general functions of the organizations.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                             Journal
1.  ‘Pattern of Consumption and Poverty in Delhi Slums’ : Economic and Political Weekly
2.  ‘Declining Incidence of Poverty in the 1980s — Evidence versus Artefacts’ :  Economic Times
3.  ‘The Chinese Economic Miracle: Lessons to be Learnt’ :  The Hindu Business Line
4. ‘Is Poverty now a Permanent Phenomenon in Pakistan?’ :  The Indian Express


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Naveen Kumar and S.C. Aggarwal's article, ‘Pattern of Consumption and Poverty in Delhi Slums,’ appeared in the *Economic and Political Weekly*.  S. Azhar Zami's article, ‘Is Poverty now a Permanent Phenomenon in Pakistan?’ was published in the *Economic and Political Weekly*. The other options are incorrect. This question tests knowledge of academic journals and articles related to poverty and development.  The distractors use similar-sounding journals to create plausible but incorrect options.



**4. With reference to the study of poverty in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Scholar/Person                                 Contribution/Association
1.  Dadabhai Naoroji                             :  Early concept of Poverty Line
2.  Arokya Ray                                   :  Studies on Chinese economic growth
3.  V.M. Dandekar and Nilakantha Rath          :  Work on the political economy of poverty
4.  Shaheen Rafi Khan and Damian Killen         :  Studies on the dimensions of poverty


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji's work included early discussions on a poverty line in India. Arokya Ray has written extensively on the Chinese economy. V.M. Dandekar and Nilakantha Rath are known for their work on the political economy of poverty in India. Shaheen Rafi Khan and Damian Killen have contributed to research on the various dimensions of poverty.  All the pairings are accurate; this question tests factual recall of scholars and their contributions to the field of poverty studies.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                          Description
1.  Human Capital                                  :  Investment in health, education, and training
2.  Seigniorage                                    :  Profit from money creation by the central bank
3.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates :  Comparison of prices of a basket of goods across countries
4.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)       : Measures the real value of a currency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Human capital refers to investments in education, health, and training that enhance productivity. Seigniorage is the profit a central bank earns from creating money. PPP exchange rates compare the cost of a standard basket of goods across countries. NEER measures the nominal value of a currency, not its real value. This question tests conceptual understanding of economic terms.  The distractor in option (d) is designed to be plausible to those who may confuse NEER with REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate).


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Subsidy                     Example
1. Producer Subsidy                     :   Minimum Support Price (MSP) to farmers
2. Consumer Subsidy                     :   LPG subsidy through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)
3. Direct Subsidy                        :   Price subsidy on fertilizers
4. Indirect Subsidy                       :   Government procurement of subsidized goods
5. Implicit Subsidy                       :   Government provision of subsidized social services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a direct payment to producers (farmers), hence a producer subsidy.  LPG subsidy disbursed directly to consumers via DBT is a consumer subsidy.  Fertilizer subsidies, where the government sells fertilizers below market price, are direct subsidies.  Government procurement of goods at subsidized prices, even if indirectly benefiting consumers, represents a form of indirect subsidy.  Finally, the government’s provision of social services like healthcare and education at subsidized rates or free of cost is an example of implicit subsidy, as the benefit is not directly linked to a specific transaction but rather embedded in the overall service delivery.  Therefore, all five pairs accurately reflect different types of subsidies and their corresponding examples.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Subsidy Type                       Issue Associated
1. Price Subsidy                       :   Leakages undermine effectiveness
2. Price Subsidy                       :   Distorts markets, harming the poor
3. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)      :   Regressive benefits distribution
4. Price Subsidy                       :   Often regressive, benefiting the rich more
5. Income Support                      :   No market distortion

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Price subsidies are susceptible to leakages, where resources intended for the poor are diverted elsewhere.  They also distort market mechanisms by interfering with price signals, potentially harming the poor who rely on efficient resource allocation.  Price subsidies are frequently regressive, disproportionately benefiting wealthier individuals who consume more of the subsidized good.  Income support, unlike price subsidies and DBT, does not directly influence market prices and therefore avoids market distortion. Option (c) is incorrect because it excludes the correct pairing of Income Support with the absence of market distortion. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, omitting several correct pairings.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic of Public Goods       Example
1. Non-rivalrous consumption        :   Police services
2. Non-excludable benefits           :   National defense
3. Rivalrous consumption              :   Border security services
4. Excludable benefits                :   Public parks
5. Non-rivalrous consumption        :   Border security

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Public goods are characterized by non-rivalrous consumption (one person's use doesn't diminish another's) and non-excludability (it's difficult to prevent anyone from benefiting).  Police services and national defense fit these criteria. Border security also demonstrates non-rivalrous consumption; the protection provided to one citizen doesn't reduce the protection afforded to others.  Public parks, however, are excludable (one could charge admission) and to some degree rivalrous (overcrowding can diminish enjoyment). Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of UBI                        Description
1. Periodic                               :   Paid as a one-time grant
2. Cash Payment                          :   Paid in vouchers for specific use
3. Individual                             :   Paid to households
4. Universal                             :   Paid based on a means test
5. Unconditional                          :   Requires work or willingness to work

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.  UBI is characterized by regular, periodic payments, not one-time grants.  It's typically a cash payment, not vouchers.  It's paid to individuals, not households. It's universal, not means-tested.  And it's unconditional; no work requirement is attached.  Therefore, none of the pairs accurately reflect the features of a Universal Basic Income.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Economic Concept                     Description
1.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)      :   Compares prices of different baskets of goods across countries
2.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) :   Indicates appreciation or depreciation of a currency
3.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   Reflects changes in trade competitiveness
4.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)          :   Measures changes in prices of services only
5.  Wholesale Price Index (WPI)         :   Gives higher weightage to food items than CPI

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the definition of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is correctly matched.  PPP uses a common basket of goods to compare prices across countries.  NEER and REER are both exchange rate measures, but NEER reflects the nominal value, while REER incorporates inflation adjustments and relates to trade competitiveness.  CPI incorporates both goods and services, not just services.  WPI doesn't necessarily give higher weightage to food items than CPI; the weightage varies based on the basket of goods considered for each index.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy during 1950-1991       Characteristic
1. License Raj                             :   Promoted competition and entrepreneurship
2. Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI)  :   Led to technological backwardness
3. Reservation for small-scale industries :   Facilitated economies of scale
4.  MRTP Act 1969                        :   Encouraged business expansion
5.  Green Revolution                      :   Slowed agricultural growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the statement about Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) leading to technological backwardness is correctly matched.  The License Raj, with its complex regulations, stifled competition and entrepreneurship.  Reservations for small-scale industries hindered the achievement of economies of scale.  The MRTP Act restricted business expansion for large firms.  The Green Revolution significantly increased agricultural output.  Therefore, only pair 2 accurately reflects the characteristic of the corresponding policy.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Macroeconomic Variable              Description
1.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)       :   Includes net factor income from abroad
2.  Gross National Product (GNP)       :   Excludes depreciation
3.  Net National Product (NNP)         :   Value of goods and services at constant prices
4.  Real GDP                            :   Value of goods and services at current prices
5.  Nominal GDP                         :   The total value of all final goods and services produced in a country


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 5 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the description of Nominal GDP is correct. GDP measures the value of goods and services produced within a country's borders, excluding net factor income from abroad.  GNP includes net factor income from abroad.  NNP accounts for depreciation.  Real GDP uses constant prices, while nominal GDP uses current prices. Therefore, only pair 5 is correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Function                   Description
1. Allocation Function                  :   Attempts to achieve a fair income distribution
2. Distribution Function               :   Provides public goods like national defense
3. Stabilization Function               :   Addresses economic fluctuations like inflation
4. Allocation Function                  :   Regulates markets to prevent monopolies
5. Distribution Function               :   Collects taxes to fund social welfare programs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 5 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the Stabilization function (addressing economic fluctuations) and the Distribution function (using tax revenue for social welfare) are correctly matched. The Allocation function focuses on providing public goods, not income distribution.  The Allocation function primarily involves resource allocation, not market regulation.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fiscal Policy Measure                  Effect
1. Increased Government Spending       :   Reduces aggregate demand
2. Reduced Taxes                         :   Increases aggregate supply
3. Increased Government Borrowing      :   Can lead to higher interest rates
4. Increased Taxes                       :   Decreases disposable income
5. Reduced Government Spending         :   Increases fiscal deficit


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Only the effects of increased government borrowing leading to higher interest rates and increased taxes decreasing disposable income are correctly matched. Increased government spending boosts aggregate demand.  Tax reductions increase aggregate demand, not supply.  Reduced government spending typically reduces, not increases, the fiscal deficit. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                  Description
1. Paradox of Thrift                       :   Increased saving leads to higher aggregate saving
2.  Multiplier Effect                      :   A change in autonomous spending causes a larger change in output
3.  Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) :   The proportion of income saved
4.  Autonomous Expenditure Multiplier   :   Determined solely by the marginal propensity to save
5.  Effective Demand Principle            :   Aggregate output determined by aggregate supply


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the description of the Multiplier Effect is correct.  The Paradox of Thrift states that increased saving can lead to lower aggregate saving.  MPC is the proportion of income *consumed*, not saved.  The autonomous expenditure multiplier is determined by MPC, not MPS.  The Effective Demand Principle states that aggregate output is determined by aggregate *demand*, not supply. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept                     Description
1. Marginal Propensity to Consume     :   The proportion of additional income saved
2. Ex ante Investment                  :   Actual investment made during a period
3. Ex post Investment                  :   Planned investment for a future period
4. Autonomous Expenditure Multiplier :   The ratio of change in equilibrium income to change in autonomous spending

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is the proportion of additional income spent on consumption, not saved.  Ex ante investment refers to planned investment, while ex post investment is the actual investment realized. The autonomous expenditure multiplier accurately describes the relationship between a change in autonomous spending and the resulting change in equilibrium income. Options 1, 2, and 3 present common misconceptions regarding these key macroeconomic concepts.  Option (c) is correct because it correctly defines the autonomous expenditure multiplier.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Budget Component         Description
1. Revenue Receipts                     :   Expenditures that create physical or financial assets
2. Capital Receipts                      :   Current government income from taxes and non-tax sources
3. Revenue Expenditure                 :   Government spending on day-to-day operations and interest payments
4. Capital Expenditure                  :   Government borrowing and other non-tax revenue sources

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Revenue receipts are indeed the current income of the government from taxes and non-tax sources. Revenue expenditure accurately describes the government's spending on its day-to-day functioning and interest payments.  Capital receipts are inflows of funds that do not represent current income, such as borrowing or the sale of assets. Capital expenditure is the investment in assets like infrastructure, which increases the government’s capital stock. Options 1 and 3 correctly define the revenue components of the budget; Options 2 and 4 incorrectly interchange the descriptions of capital receipts and expenditure.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Fiscal Policy Measure                 Effect on Equilibrium Income
1. Increase in Government Spending    :   Decrease in equilibrium income
2. Increase in Lump-Sum Taxes          :   Increase in equilibrium income
3. Decrease in Proportional Taxes       :   Increase in equilibrium income
4. Balanced Budget Increase in G & T :   No change in equilibrium income

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

An increase in government spending directly boosts aggregate demand, leading to a rise in equilibrium income.  Similarly, a decrease in taxes increases disposable income, stimulating consumption and raising equilibrium income.  A balanced budget increase in government spending and taxes has a multiplier effect of one; that is, equilibrium income increases by the amount of the increase in government spending. Option 1 and 2 incorrectly state the effects of government spending and lump-sum taxes on equilibrium income. Option (b) correctly identifies the impact of a decrease in proportional taxes and a balanced budget increase in government spending and taxes.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Type of Subsidy                      Method of Disbursement
1. Price Subsidy                         :   Direct cash transfer to beneficiaries
2. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)        :   Subsidized prices for specific goods
3. Income Support                       :   Unconditional cash transfers to individuals or households
4. Universal Basic Income (UBI)         :   Targeted subsidies based on income or need

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

DBT involves direct cash transfers, while income support provides unconditional cash transfers. Price subsidies involve selling goods at below-market prices. UBI is a form of income support, not a targeted subsidy. Option (c) is correct because it correctly matches DBT and income support with their respective disbursement mechanisms.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Characteristic of Inclusive Growth    Description
1. Broad-based Growth                  :   Focuses solely on income redistribution
2. Focus on Productive Employment   :   Prioritizes direct cash transfers over job creation
3. Long-term Perspective                :   Emphasizes short-term gains over sustained development
4. Equality of Opportunity              :   Ensures equal access to resources and markets

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Inclusive growth prioritizes broad-based growth across sectors, ensuring that the benefits reach various segments of the population. It emphasizes productive employment to empower individuals and create sustainable livelihoods.  A long-term perspective is crucial for inclusive growth, focusing on sustained development rather than short-term gains.  Equality of opportunity is fundamental, providing fair access to resources and markets. Options 1,2, and 3 incorrectly describe inclusive growth. Option (d) is correct as it correctly defines productive employment and equality of opportunity as characteristics of inclusive growth.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Policy                       Objective
1. Command and Control                  :   Market-driven growth with government facilitation
2. Plug and Play                         :   Top-down planning and control of production
3. Amrit Kaal                              :   25-year plan for a developed India
4. Fiscal Policy                          :   Stabilizing output and employment through government spending and taxation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Command and control refers to a centrally planned economy, while plug and play describes a policy environment where the private sector is free to operate with minimal government interference. Amrit Kaal is indeed a 25-year plan for a developed India. Fiscal policy, uses government spending and taxation to influence the economy's output and employment. Option (b) is correct as it correctly matches Amrit Kaal and Fiscal Policy with their objectives. Options 1 and 2 are incorrectly matched.



**7. Consider the following statements:**

Statement                                   True or False
1.  An increase in NEER indicates rupee appreciation.     : True
2.  An increase in REER indicates improved trade competitiveness. : False
3.  Increasing domestic inflation relative to other countries causes increasing divergence between NEER and REER. : True

Which of the statements given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

A higher Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) signifies that the rupee has appreciated against a basket of currencies. An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) reflects a *decline* in trade competitiveness, as domestic goods become relatively more expensive compared to foreign goods.  A widening gap between NEER and REER is indeed a consequence of differing inflation rates between a country and its trading partners. Option (a) is correct as it correctly matches statements 1 and 3. Statement 2 is incorrect.


**8. With reference to Public Goods, consider the following pairs:**

Characteristic                     Example
1. Non-rivalrous                     : A congested highway
2. Non-excludable                   :  A pay-per-view television broadcast
3. Provided by the government      : National defense
4. Market failure                    : Public park

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) Only 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A public good is non-rivalrous (one person's consumption doesn't diminish another's) and non-excludable (it's difficult to prevent anyone from consuming it).  National defense is a classic example of a public good provided by the government. A congested highway is rivalrous, and a pay-per-view broadcast is excludable.  Public parks demonstrate market failure because private provision would likely underprovide them due to the free-rider problem.  Only pair 3 accurately reflects a characteristic and example of a public good.


**9. With reference to the Indian Economy, consider the following pairs:**

Concept                         Description
1. Paradox of Thrift                 : Increased saving leads to increased aggregate demand
2. Effective Demand Principle       : Output is determined by aggregate supply
3. Multiplier Effect                 : An increase in autonomous spending leads to a smaller increase in output
4.  Seigniorage                       : Profit from money creation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1,2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Paradox of Thrift states that increased saving can lead to decreased aggregate demand, not increased. The Effective Demand Principle states that output is determined by aggregate demand, not supply. The Multiplier Effect describes how an increase in autonomous spending leads to a *larger* increase in output. Seigniorage is indeed the profit a central bank makes from issuing currency.  Only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**10. With reference to Rural Development in India, consider the following pairs:**

Program/Initiative                     Focus
1. National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) : Self-employment opportunities in rural areas
2.  Food for Work Programme           :   Guaranteed wage employment for unskilled workers
3.  Prime Minister’s Rozgar Yojana (PMRY)    :   Providing minimum basic amenities to people
4.  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) :   Improving rural infrastructure

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NREGA focuses on providing guaranteed wage employment, not self-employment. Food for Work was a program aimed at generating wage employment for the rural poor. PMRY focused on self-employment opportunities,  while PMGSY targeted rural infrastructure development. Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on aspects of government budgeting, fiscal policy, and macroeconomic principles, drawing parallels to the economic concepts presented in the source material.  Remember that these questions are designed to be challenging and require a strong understanding of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                          Description
1.  Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) :  The proportion of additional income saved.
2.  Paradox of Thrift                        :  Increased saving leads to reduced aggregate demand.
3.  Autonomous Expenditure Multiplier      :  Ratio of change in equilibrium output to change in autonomous spending.
4.  Effective Demand Principle              : Aggregate supply determines aggregate output.
5.  Government Budget Revenue Expenditure: Expenditure that creates physical or financial assets.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

* **Pair 2:** The Paradox of Thrift accurately describes the situation where increased individual saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand, potentially hindering economic growth. This is because reduced consumption expenditure offsets the increased savings, resulting in lower overall economic activity.

* **Pair 3:** The autonomous expenditure multiplier correctly defines the relationship between a change in autonomous spending (independent of income) and the resulting change in equilibrium output.  A higher multiplier indicates a greater impact of a change in autonomous spending on the overall economy.

The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** MPC is the proportion of additional income *spent*, not saved.  The Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) is the proportion saved.

* **Pair 4:** The Effective Demand Principle states that aggregate *demand* determines aggregate output in the short run, assuming perfectly elastic aggregate supply.

* **Pair 5:** Revenue expenditure, by definition, does *not* create physical or financial assets.  It covers day-to-day government operations. Capital expenditure is what creates assets.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Budget Component                Characteristic
1. Revenue Receipts                           :  Include only tax revenues.
2. Revenue Expenditure                      :  Always results in the creation of assets.
3. Tax Revenue                               :  Comprises only indirect taxes.
4. Non-Tax Revenue                          :  Includes interest receipts on government loans.
5. Capital Budget                             :  Deals solely with plan expenditure.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched.  Non-tax revenue for the government includes various sources, and interest receipts from government loans are a significant component.

The other pairs are incorrect because:

* **Pair 1:** Revenue receipts include both tax and non-tax revenues.

* **Pair 2:** Revenue expenditure is for the normal functioning of government, not asset creation; that's capital expenditure.

* **Pair 3:** Tax revenue includes both direct and indirect taxes.

* **Pair 5:** The capital budget encompasses both plan and non-plan capital expenditures.


**3. With reference to macroeconomic concepts, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                       Definition
1.  GDP at Factor Cost                        :  Total value of goods and services at market prices, including indirect taxes.
2.  GDP at Market Prices                      :  Total value of goods and services at basic prices, excluding indirect taxes.
3.  Per Capita GDP                            :  GDP divided by the total population.
4.  Nominal GDP                              :  Measures the value of output at constant prices.
5.  Real GDP                                 : Measures the value of output at current prices.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Per capita GDP is calculated by dividing the total GDP by the population of the country, providing a measure of GDP per person.

The other pairs are incorrect because:

* **Pair 1:** GDP at factor cost excludes indirect taxes; GDP at market prices includes them.

* **Pair 2:** GDP at market prices includes indirect taxes; GDP at factor cost excludes them.

* **Pair 4:** Nominal GDP measures output at *current* prices.

* **Pair 5:** Real GDP measures output at *constant* prices (a base year's prices).


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Macroeconomic Indicator                     Interpretation of Increase
1.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)   :  Indicates a depreciation of the domestic currency.
2.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)      :  Signals improved trade competitiveness.
3.  Trade Deficit                              :  Indicates higher exports than imports.
4.  Inflation Rate                             : Represents a decrease in the general price level.
5.  Capital Output Ratio                       : Indicates greater capital efficiency.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. An increase in the REER suggests that domestic goods have become relatively more expensive compared to foreign goods, potentially impacting trade competitiveness.  However, the impact isn't always straightforward and depends on other economic factors.

Other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** An increase in NEER suggests appreciation, not depreciation.

* **Pair 3:** A trade deficit means imports exceed exports.

* **Pair 4:** Inflation represents an *increase*, not a decrease, in the general price level.

* **Pair 5:** A higher capital-output ratio indicates *lower*, not greater, capital efficiency (more capital needed per unit of output).


These questions test knowledge of key macroeconomic concepts and government fiscal policies, requiring a nuanced understanding beyond simple definitions.  The distractors are designed to challenge even well-prepared candidates.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Initiative                        Focus
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana          :   Funding voluntary organizations for skill development
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme           :   Reducing India's dependence on gold imports
3. Gold Monetization Scheme             :   Promoting FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme             :   Consumption requirements of farm households

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) aims to provide funding to small and micro entrepreneurs, not voluntary organizations.  The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme are both designed to bring idle gold held by households into the formal financial system, thereby reducing reliance on imports and potentially impacting the balance of payments. However, neither is directly focused on promoting FDI in the gold and jewellery sector. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme offers short-term credit to farmers for various agricultural needs, including working capital, purchase of inputs, and post-harvest expenses; however, consumption requirements of farm households are only one part of its objectives. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include mismatched pairs based on the actual objectives of these schemes.


**2. With reference to the Indian Economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                         Description
1. Merchant Discount Rate                :   Incentive given by a bank to a merchant for accepting debit card payments
2. Legal Tender Money                     :   Metallic money in circulation in a country
3. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)         :   Decided by each individual bank
4. Money Multiplier                       :   Increases with an increase in the statutory liquidity ratio

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is the fee charged to a merchant by a bank for accepting card payments, not an incentive. Legal tender money is currency that a creditor is legally obligated to accept for payment of debts, not just metallic money. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is a regulatory requirement set by central banks, not individual banks.  The money multiplier is inversely related to the cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio; an increase in these ratios decreases the money multiplier.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                      Associated Characteristic
1. Demand-pull inflation                   :   Rising interest rates
2. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)         :   Compares prices of a basket of goods across countries
3. V-shaped recovery                     :   Rapid and sustained poverty reduction
4. Inclusive Growth                        :   Focuses on productive employment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Demand-pull inflation is caused by increased aggregate demand, not rising interest rates (which are a contractionary measure). Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) indeed compares the prices of identical goods and services in different countries to determine relative exchange rates. A V-shaped recovery is a sharp, quick rebound from an economic downturn, not directly associated with poverty reduction. Inclusive growth prioritizes equitable distribution of economic benefits and productive employment. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to financial instruments, consider the following pairs:**

   Instrument                                  Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                          :   Long-term instrument issued by the RBI
2. Certificate of Deposit                       :   Short-term unsecured promissory note
3. Call Money                                 :   Long-term finance used for interbank transactions
4. Zero Coupon Bonds                           :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations, not a long-term instrument issued by the RBI. Certificates of deposit are short-term debt instruments issued by banks, not corporations. Call money is short-term interbank lending, not long-term. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; the return is derived from the difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity.  Therefore, none of the provided pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Economic Indicator                        Interpretation
1. Increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   Indicates depreciation of the rupee
2. Increase in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     :   Indicates improvement in trade competitiveness
3. Increasing trend in domestic inflation relative to other countries : Causes increasing divergence between NEER and REER

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

An increase in NEER signifies appreciation, not depreciation, of the domestic currency relative to a basket of other currencies. An increase in REER, which adjusts for inflation, does indicate improved trade competitiveness.  A widening gap between NEER and REER is a consequence of a disparity in domestic and foreign inflation rates. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accurate relationship between the economic indicators and their interpretations.



**6. With reference to the functioning of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

  Aspect                                    Characteristic
1. RBI Governor Appointment                 :   Appointed by the State Governments
2. RBI's Power Source                        :   Derived from the Indian Constitution
3.  Government Directions to RBI            :   Issued only with the consent of RBI

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RBI Governor is appointed by the Central Government, not the State Governments. The RBI's powers are primarily derived from the RBI Act, 1934, not directly from the Indian Constitution, though the Constitution empowers the government to issue directions in public interest. The government can issue directions to the RBI in public interest, but it is not dependent on RBI's consent. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sector/Activity                           Employment Characteristic
1. Formal Sector                             :   Predominantly casual wage labour
2. Informal Sector                           :   Enjoys social security benefits
3. Public Sector Establishments              :   Always employs fewer than 10 workers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The formal sector is characterized by regular employment and social security benefits, unlike the description given. The informal sector is typically characterized by casual employment and lack of social security benefits. Public sector establishments can employ 10 or more workers, hence the statement is incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the Indian economy's growth and employment patterns, consider the following pairs:**

   Period/Phenomenon                       Characteristic
1. 1960-2000                               :   Employment growth consistently outpaced GDP growth
2. Late 1990s                               :   Widening gap between GDP growth and employment growth (Jobless Growth)
3.  Shift from farm work to non-farm work   :   No significant change in the proportion of self-employed workers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

During 1960-2000, GDP growth generally outpaced employment growth, not the other way around. The late 1990s witnessed a significant increase in this gap, leading to the phenomenon of jobless growth. The shift from farm to non-farm work did result in a change in the distribution of employment, affecting the proportion of self-employed workers. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Macroeconomic Variable                  Calculation Method
1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)             :   Only Income Method
2. Gross National Product (GNP)           :   GDP + Net factor income from abroad
3. Net National Product (NNP)             :   GNP + Depreciation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GDP can be calculated using the product, expenditure, and income methods. GNP is correctly calculated by adding net factor income from abroad to GDP.  NNP is calculated by subtracting depreciation from GNP, not adding it. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**10. With reference to macroeconomic identities, consider the following pairs:**

   Identity                                   Relationship
1.  I = S                                    :   Applicable only in an economy with government and foreign trade
2.  I + G + X - M = S + T                  :   Represents the equilibrium condition in an open economy with a government
3.  GDP = C + S + T                           :   Shows how households dispose of their earnings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The identity I = S holds true only in a closed economy without government intervention. The identity I + G + X - M = S + T accurately represents the equilibrium condition in an open economy with a government sector.  The identity GDP = C + S + T correctly reflects the ways households allocate their income. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect because the identity I=S is only applicable in a closed economy with no government intervention.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                     Post-1991 Trend in India
1. Share of agriculture in GDP           :   Increased enormously
2. Share of India's exports in world trade :   Decreased significantly
3. FDI inflows                           :   Increased substantially
4. India's foreign exchange reserves     :   Increased enormously

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Post-1991 liberalization, India experienced significant shifts in its economic landscape.  While FDI inflows (3) and foreign exchange reserves (4) demonstrably increased, the share of agriculture in GDP (1) did not increase enormously.  In fact, while its absolute value may have increased, its *share* in the GDP decreased as the services and industrial sectors grew faster. The share of India's exports in world trade (2) also did not decrease significantly, but rather saw an increase, albeit not as dramatic as the increase in FDI and reserves.  Option (b) accurately reflects the substantial increase in FDI inflows and foreign exchange reserves, which are hallmarks of the post-liberalization era. The other options incorrectly incorporate the trends in agricultural GDP share and export share in world trade.  Understanding these nuanced economic shifts is crucial for a comprehensive grasp of India's post-liberalization trajectory.  The question tests factual recall and analytical abilities by requiring the candidate to differentiate between absolute growth and proportional change in economic indicators.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sectoral Shift in India's Economy       Characteristic
1. Shift from agriculture to industry      :   Followed a typical developmental trajectory
2. Shift from agriculture to services      :   An exception to typical development patterns
3. Dominance of services sector in GDP  :   Caused by inadequate infrastructure for manufacturing
4. Manufacturing sector's growth         :    Hindered by complex land acquisition processes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India's economic development deviated from the standard agricultural-industrial-services progression. The shift from agriculture to services (2) is a unique feature of India's growth, unlike the typical developmental path (1). The dominance of the services sector (3) is partly due to insufficient infrastructure, regulatory hurdles, and other challenges in the manufacturing sector.  Complex land acquisition (4) is one of the significant factors responsible for hindering the growth of manufacturing industries. Option (d) correctly identifies these key characteristics of India’s economic transition.  Option (a) is incorrect because while the dominance of the services sector is linked to the lack of manufacturing development, it doesn't represent a typical developmental trajectory. Options (b) and (c) contain incorrect pairings of characteristics with sectoral shifts. This question tests the candidate’s understanding of India's unique economic development path and the factors contributing to its sectoral composition. The question assesses conceptual understanding and analytical skills.


**3. With reference to the factors affecting manufacturing growth in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Factor                                  Challenge
1. Land availability                       :   High population density, complex acquisition procedures
2. Transportation infrastructure          :   Costly freight, poor rural connectivity
3. Port efficiency                         :   Inefficient management, delays in import/export
4. Power availability                      :   Unreliable supply, high cost in some regions
5. Labour laws                            :   Rigid regulations, difficult compliance for firms


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs accurately reflect the challenges hindering manufacturing growth in India.  Land scarcity (1) due to high population density and bureaucratic land acquisition processes is a major impediment.  The transportation network (2) suffers from high costs and connectivity issues, particularly in rural areas.  Port inefficiencies (3) lead to delays and increased costs for imports and exports.  Power supply (4) remains unreliable and expensive in several regions, disrupting production.  Finally, the complex and rigid labour laws (5) make it difficult for businesses to operate efficiently.  Option (d) thus correctly matches all the factors and their associated challenges.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these crucial pairings. This question assesses factual recall, analytical skills, and the candidate's understanding of the constraints on India's manufacturing sector. The question is designed to be difficult due to the number of pairs and the need for precise knowledge of Indian economic realities.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative                   Objective
1.  District Mineral Foundations (DMF)   :   Promoting mineral exploration activities
2.  National Investment Fund (NIF)      :   Financing select social sectors
3.  Make in India                          :   Increasing the share of manufacturing in GDP
4.  UDAY (Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana):   Improving the financial health of DISCOMs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs presented correctly link the government initiative to its primary objective. District Mineral Foundations (DMF) (1) are indeed established to benefit communities affected by mining operations, though mineral exploration is not their primary focus. The National Investment Fund (NIF) (2) utilizes a portion of its income to fund social sectors.  The Make in India (3) initiative aims to significantly increase manufacturing's contribution to the GDP. UDAY (4) was specifically designed to address the financial distress plaguing state-owned electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs). Therefore, option (d) correctly matches all four pairs. The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these accurate pairings.  This question tests factual recall and the candidate's understanding of various Indian government initiatives across different sectors. The comprehensive nature of the question and the need for precise knowledge of multiple schemes make it a difficult question.


**5. With reference to India's economic structure, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Sector                      Characteristic
1. Agriculture                           :   Largest employer in rural areas
2. Manufacturing                        :   Contributes a smaller share to GDP than services
3. Services                              :   Employs a significant portion of skilled labour
4. Informal sector                       :   Characterized by a high proportion of casual labour
5. Formal sector                         :   Offers better social security benefits to employees

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately describes a characteristic of the respective economic sector in India.  Agriculture (1) remains the dominant source of employment in rural India. The manufacturing sector (2) contributes a smaller percentage to the GDP compared to the services sector. The services sector (3) typically employs a higher proportion of skilled workers. The informal sector (4) is largely characterized by casual employment and lack of social security. The formal sector (5) provides better job security and social security benefits.  Therefore, option (d) correctly matches all five pairs.  Other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these accurate pairings.  This question assesses factual recall, analytical skills, and the candidate's understanding of the structure of the Indian economy. The comprehensive nature of the question and the need for detailed knowledge of various sectors make it a difficult question.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                      Associated Author/Work
1.  Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation :  V.M. Dandekar and Nilakantha Rath
2.  The Political Economy of Hunger     :   Amartya Sen
3.  Everybody Loves a Good Drought: Stories from India’s Poorest Districts : Jean Dreze


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because only the third pair is correctly matched.  Amartya Sen is indeed associated with the seminal work "Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation," while Jean Drèze is the author of "Everybody Loves a Good Drought: Stories from India’s Poorest Districts."  The work "The Political Economy of Hunger" is associated with multiple authors and is not solely attributable to Amartya Sen. V.M. Dandekar and Nilakantha Rath are known for their work on poverty in India, but not the specified title. The other options incorrectly attribute authorship or associate works with the wrong authors.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of key figures in development economics.  The distractors are designed to be plausible to someone with a general understanding of the field but lacking specific knowledge of the exact book titles and authors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy                         Key Feature
1.  Import Substitution                    :  Emphasis on export promotion
2.  Disinvestment                          :  Complete withdrawal of government from ownership
3.  Globalisation                           :  Increased economic interdependence
4.  Liberalisation                          :  Removal of trade barriers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because only pairs 3 and 4 are accurately matched. Globalisation is characterized by increased economic interdependence between nations, and liberalization involves the removal of trade barriers to facilitate greater market access. Import substitution focuses on domestic production to replace imports, not export promotion. Disinvestment involves reducing government stake, not complete withdrawal. This question tests the understanding of core economic policies and their defining characteristics.  The distractors exploit common misconceptions about the nuances of these policies.  A candidate needs precise knowledge to answer correctly.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Committee           Focus Area
1.  NITI Aayog                             :   Allocation of funds to ministries
2.  Narasimhan Committee I               :   Banking sector reforms
3.  P.J. Nayak Committee                 :   Governance of PSBs' boards
4.  Dalwai Committee                      :  Doubling Farmers' Income


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is the correct answer. The Narasimhan Committee I focused on reforming the Indian financial system, including the banking sector. The P.J. Nayak Committee specifically addressed governance issues within the boards of public sector banks (PSBs). The Dalwai Committee's mandate was to explore strategies for doubling farmers' income. NITI Aayog doesn't allocate funds; that's the Finance Ministry's role. This question tests knowledge of Indian government bodies and their roles in economic policy and planning. The distractors include a prominent government body with a slightly related but different function, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of these institutions' mandates.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financing Facility                        Key Feature
1.  Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) :  Interest subvention for farm loans
2.  PMFBY                                    :  Focus on post-harvest losses
3.  Fund for farm and farm processing activities :  Credit guarantee coverage for MSMEs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct.  The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) explicitly covers post-harvest losses. The fund for farm and farm processing activities provides credit guarantee coverage, particularly beneficial for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). AHIDF focuses on animal husbandry infrastructure, not directly on farm loans. This question assesses knowledge of specific government schemes and their key features, requiring detailed understanding of agricultural policies.  The distractors play on the general theme of agricultural support but lack the specificity needed for accurate matching.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Concept              Characteristic
1.  Domestically Systemically Important Banks (DSIBs) :  Asset size below 2% of GDP
2.  Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)       :  Investment exceeding 10% of equity capital
3.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)          :  Active management participation
4.  Strategic Disinvestment                   :  Transfer of management control


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) typically involves active management participation by the foreign investor. Strategic disinvestment involves the transfer of management control to a strategic partner.  DSIBs have asset sizes exceeding 2% of GDP, not below. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) is defined by investments below 10% of equity capital, not exceeding it. This question tests understanding of financial concepts and definitions, requiring precise knowledge of terminology and thresholds. The distractors are designed to be confusing by using values close to the correct ones or misrepresenting the key features.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Factor                   Impact on Indian Manufacturing
1. Availability of Land                 :  High population density and complex land acquisition processes hinder large-scale industrial development.
2. Transportation Infrastructure       :  Costly and inefficient transportation (roads and railways) increases production costs and reduces competitiveness.
3. Port Efficiency                     :  Inefficient port management leads to delays in import/export, increasing costs and hindering global competition.
4. Power Availability                  :  Unreliable and expensive power supply disrupts production and increases costs, particularly impacting manufacturing firms.
5. Labour Laws                         :  Complex labour laws make it difficult for manufacturing firms to comply and hinder flexibility in workforce management.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the challenges faced by the Indian manufacturing sector.  The text explicitly details how each factor – land acquisition, transportation, port efficiency, power supply, and labour laws – has significantly constrained industrial development.  High population density and complicated land acquisition procedures make it difficult to secure large tracts of land needed for manufacturing facilities.  Inefficient and costly transportation systems (both road and rail) add to production costs, reducing the competitiveness of Indian goods in the global market.  Similarly, inefficient port management leads to significant delays in the import of raw materials and export of finished goods, impacting profitability and global competitiveness.  The lack of reliable and affordable power supply, a critical input for manufacturing, disrupts production and raises costs.  Finally, the complexity of Indian labour laws creates significant hurdles for businesses, hindering flexibility and increasing compliance costs.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Five Year Plan Period               Focus/Characteristic
1. First Five Year Plan                 :  Emphasis on agriculture and rural development
2. Second Five Year Plan                :  Focus on heavy industries and industrialization
3. Third Five Year Plan                  :  Emphasis on import substitution and self-reliance
4. Fourth Five Year Plan                 :  Focus on poverty alleviation and employment generation
5. Fifth Five Year Plan                   :  Focus on removing poverty and achieving self-sufficiency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects the primary focus or characteristic of the corresponding Five Year Plan in India's post-independence economic planning. The First Five Year Plan prioritized agriculture and rural development, laying the foundation for agricultural growth. The Second Five Year Plan shifted the emphasis to heavy industries and industrialization, aiming for rapid industrial expansion. The Third Five Year Plan focused on import substitution, promoting domestic production to reduce reliance on imports. The Fourth Five Year Plan incorporated poverty alleviation and employment generation as key objectives. The Fifth Five Year Plan continued the focus on poverty reduction and self-sufficiency, emphasizing balanced regional development.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. With reference to the Indian Economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                 Description
1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)      :  The total value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a year.
2. Gross National Product (GNP)     : The total value of all final goods and services produced by a country's residents, regardless of location, in a year.
3.  Per Capita Income                :  GDP divided by the total population of a country.
4. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) : A weighted average of a currency's exchange rates against other currencies, reflecting changes in the value of the currency.
5. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER): NEER adjusted for inflation differences between countries.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs present accurate definitions and descriptions of key economic indicators. GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country's geographical boundaries; GNP considers production by a nation's residents regardless of location. Per capita income is a crucial indicator of a country's average standard of living. NEER provides a comprehensive measure of a currency's value against a basket of other currencies, while REER accounts for inflation differentials, offering a more realistic picture of a currency’s competitiveness.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one accurately described economic indicator.


**4. With reference to the challenges faced by the “Make in India” initiative, consider the following pairs:**

   Challenge                                 Specific Issue
1. Low Labour Productivity                 :  Indian manufacturing workers are significantly less productive than their counterparts in countries like China and Thailand.
2. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Issues :  A substantial portion of FDI comes from Mauritius-based shell companies, raising concerns about the nature of investment.
3. Size of Industrial Units                 :  Small-scale industrial units limit economies of scale, hindering investment in modern equipment and supply chain development.
4. Labour Laws                             :  Outdated and complex labour laws create compliance challenges and inflexibility in the workforce.
5. Infrastructure Deficiencies            :  Inadequate transportation networks and costly electricity increase production costs and reduce competitiveness.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately describe challenges hindering the success of the "Make in India" initiative.  The text explicitly mentions low labour productivity compared to other nations, issues with FDI inflows from shell companies, the limitations imposed by the small size of many industrial units, the complexities of existing labour laws, and infrastructure deficiencies in transportation and electricity supply. Each of these factors contributes to the difficulties faced by the initiative.  Therefore, option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to encompass the full range of correctly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to India's economic development, consider the following pairs:**

   Historical Period                     Economic Characteristic
1. Pre-Independence Era                 :  Dominance of agricultural sector in employment and GDP.
2. Post-Independence (early years)      :  Adoption of socialist policies and import substitution industrialization.
3. Post-1991 Economic Liberalization    :  Shift towards market-oriented policies and increased globalization.
4. Recent Trends                        :  Rapid growth of the services sector and emergence of the informal economy.
5.  Colonial Period                     :  Deindustrialization, export of raw materials, and import of finished goods.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a significant economic characteristic of the specified historical period in India's economic development. Before independence, the economy was overwhelmingly agrarian, with agriculture dominating both employment and GDP.  The early post-independence period saw the adoption of socialist policies and a focus on import substitution industrialization. Post-1991, India underwent significant economic liberalization, embracing market-oriented reforms and increased integration into the global economy. Recent trends show a remarkable expansion of the services sector, coupled with a growing informal economy. Finally, the colonial period is known for its deindustrialization policies, focusing on the export of raw materials to Britain and the import of finished goods.  Thus, all five pairs are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.


**6. With reference to sources of Human Capital Formation in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Investment Type                       Contribution to Human Capital
1. Education                           :  Increases future income potential and enhances overall skill levels.
2. Health                              :  Improves worker productivity and reduces absenteeism.
3. On-the-Job Training                  :  Enhances specific job skills and increases worker efficiency.
4. Migration                           :  Facilitates movement to higher-paying jobs, although at a cost.
5. Information Acquisition              :  Enables informed decision-making about investments in human capital.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly establishes that investments in education, health, on-the-job training, migration, and information acquisition all contribute significantly to human capital formation.  Education improves skills and raises earning potential.  Health investments improve worker productivity by reducing illness and absenteeism.  On-the-job training directly enhances job-specific skills.  Migration, while involving costs, can lead to higher earnings.  Finally, access to information about labor markets and training opportunities helps individuals make informed decisions about their human capital investments.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct response.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one accurately matched pair.

PM-KISAN provides direct income support to farmers.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**8. With reference to the evolution of India's economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Phase                      Key Feature
1. Pre-Independence                      :  Predominantly agrarian economy with limited industrialization.
2. Early Post-Independence               :  Emphasis on import substitution industrialization and planned economy.
3. Post-1991 Liberalization              :  Shift to market-oriented policies, privatization, and globalization.
4. Recent Decades                         :  Rapid growth of the services sector and increasing income inequality.
5. British Colonial Rule                 :  Extraction of resources, deindustrialization of traditional crafts, and exploitation of labor.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect key features of the respective economic phases in India's history. The pre-independence era was characterized by an agrarian economy with limited industrial development. The early post-independence period saw a planned economy and a focus on import substitution industrialization. Post-1991, liberalization led to market-oriented reforms, privatization, and greater integration with the global economy. Recent decades have been marked by the rapid expansion of the services sector but also by rising income inequality.  The British colonial period was defined by the extraction of resources from India, suppression of traditional industries, and exploitation of the Indian labor force. Consequently, all pairs are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one accurately described economic phase.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy/Scheme                     Primary Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana              :   Providing pension to old and destitute persons
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme               :   Promoting FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
3. Gold Monetization Scheme                 :   To reduce India’s dependence on gold imports
4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme                  :  Construction of family houses and setting up village cold storage facilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) aims at bringing small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing loans. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme are government initiatives designed to bring idle gold lying with households into the economy and reduce India's dependence on gold imports. They are not primarily aimed at promoting FDI in the gold and jewellery sector. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme provides short-term credit support to farmers for working capital, purchase of inputs, and post-harvest expenses; it does not cover the construction of houses or cold storage facilities.  Therefore, only the pairing of Gold Monetization Scheme with its objective is accurate. Option (c) is the correct answer.


**2. With reference to India's economic policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept/Policy                     Characteristic
1. Import Substitution                         :   Promoting exports of manufactured goods
2.  "Plug and Play" policy                      :   Government control over production capacity
3.  "Command and Control" approach         :   Market-driven allocation of resources
4. Amrit Kaal's Panch Pran                   :   Focus on income redistribution schemes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Import substitution is an inward-looking trade strategy that aims at replacing imports with domestic production; it does not directly promote exports. The "Plug and Play" policy emphasizes ease of doing business for private sector, contrasting with the "Command and Control" approach, which involves extensive government planning and regulation of production. The "Command and Control" approach is not market-driven; it prioritizes central planning over market forces. Amrit Kaal's Panch Pran focuses on national development goals, not specifically on income redistribution. None of the given pairs are correctly matched.  Therefore, option (d) is correct.


**3. With reference to financial institutions and instruments, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument/Institution             Description
1. Commercial Paper                           :   Long-term unsecured promissory note
2. Certificate of Deposit                       :   Short-term instrument issued by scheduled commercial banks
3. Call Money                                  :   Long-term finance used for interbank transactions
4. Zero Coupon Bonds                          :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by scheduled commercial banks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds. Certificates of Deposit are short-term borrowing instruments issued by banks. Call money is short-term interbank borrowing. Zero coupon bonds are debt instruments that do not pay periodic interest; they are sold at a discount and mature at face value.  None of the descriptions provided accurately match the financial instruments/institutions.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                          Measurement/Characteristic
1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)    :   Indicates improvement in trade competitiveness
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)       :   Indicates appreciation of the rupee
3. Consumer Price Index (CPI)                :   Lower weightage of food items compared to WPI
4. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)               :   Captures changes in service prices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NEER measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies, reflecting appreciation or depreciation; it doesn't directly indicate trade competitiveness. REER adjusts NEER for inflation differentials, influencing trade competitiveness. CPI gives higher weightage to food items than WPI. WPI does not capture service prices; CPI does.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is correct.


**5. With reference to India's economic growth, consider the following pairs:**

   Growth Phase/Period                           Characteristic
1.  1980-91                                     :   GDP growth rate of 8%
2.  1992-2001                                   :   Declining growth in agriculture and industry sectors
3.  Post-2014 Indian Economy                    :   Growth driven primarily by the manufacturing sector
4. Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-07) Projected GDP growth:  Significant increase in foreign direct investment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GDP growth rate during 1980-91 was 5.6%, not 8%.  The period 1992-2001 saw a decline in the growth rate of agriculture and industry sectors, while the service sector grew. Post-2014, the service sector remained a major contributor to India's growth; the manufacturing sector's contribution, while significant, was not the primary driver. The Tenth Five Year Plan projected an 8% GDP growth rate and significant increases in foreign direct investment.  Therefore, only pair 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (c) is correct.


**6. With reference to  inclusive growth in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Attribute of Inclusive Growth               Description
1. Opportunity                               :   Focus on providing means to protect against livelihood loss
2. Capability                                :   Concentrates on providing means to enhance capabilities
3. Access                                    :   Focuses on generating more income opportunities
4. Security                                  :   Focuses on bringing opportunities and capabilities together


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The opportunity attribute of inclusive growth is about generating income opportunities. Capability focuses on providing the means for people to enhance their capabilities. Access focuses on bringing opportunities and capabilities together. Security focuses on protecting against livelihood loss. Only the pairing of Capability with its description is correct. Therefore, option (b) is correct.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Term Related to Indian Economy                  Meaning/Description
1. Seigniorage                                     :  Interest accruing from bank balances with central banks
2. Merchant Discount Rate                           :  Incentive given by a bank to a merchant for accepting payments
3. Legal Tender Money                               : Bank money in the form of cheques, drafts, etc.
4. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)                     : Decided by each individual bank


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Seigniorage is the profit a central bank makes from issuing currency, encompassing interest income and inflation tax, not just interest from bank balances.  The Merchant Discount Rate is the charge a bank levies on a merchant for accepting card payments, not an incentive. Legal tender money is currency that a creditor is legally obliged to accept, not just bank money. CAR is a minimum regulatory requirement, not decided by individual banks.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is correct.


**8. With reference to  Bitcoins, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of Bitcoins                                    True/False
1. Tracked by Central Banks of countries                : True
2. Online payments sent without revealing identities     : False
3. Anyone with a Bitcoin address can send/receive Bitcoins : False


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Bitcoins are not tracked by central banks; they operate on a decentralized, blockchain-based system. Online Bitcoin payments can be made without revealing full identities, depending on the platform and measures taken. Anyone with a Bitcoin address can send and receive Bitcoins, but this does not always guarantee anonymity. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is correct.


**9. With reference to the functions of money, consider the following pairs:**

   Function of Money                                  Description
1. Medium of Exchange                              :  Storing wealth for future use
2. Unit of Account                                  : Expressing value of goods and services in monetary units
3. Store of Value                                   :  Facilitating transactions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A medium of exchange facilitates transactions. A unit of account expresses value in monetary terms. A store of value allows wealth preservation. Only the pairing of Unit of Account with its description is correct. Option (b) is correct.


**10.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Term/Concept                             Definition/Description
1. Potential GDP                                    : Factors inhibiting India from realizing its potential GDP
2. V-shaped recovery                               :  Difference between computing methodology of India's GDP before and after 2015
3. Inclusive growth                                 :  Rapid and sustained poverty reduction


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Potential GDP refers to the maximum output an economy can produce with full utilization of resources; it's not directly defined by factors inhibiting its realization. A V-shaped recovery is a sharp economic rebound after a downturn; it doesn't describe GDP computation methods. Inclusive growth aims for equitable distribution of growth benefits, not solely rapid poverty reduction. None of the given pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is correct.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy                        Year of Implementation/Introduction
1.  LPG Reforms                             :   1991
2.  National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship  :   2015
3.  Start-up India initiative                 :   2016
4.  Aatamanirbhar Skilled Employee Employer Mapping (ASEEM) portal :   2020
5.  Special Economic Zones Act             :   2005

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided pairs accurately reflect the chronological introduction or implementation of significant Indian economic policies.  The Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization (LPG) reforms were initiated in 1991, marking a pivotal shift in India's economic strategy.  The National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship was launched in 2015, aiming to address the skill gap and promote entrepreneurship. The Start-up India initiative, designed to foster a vibrant startup ecosystem, was introduced in 2016.  The Aatamanirbhar Skilled Employee Employer Mapping (ASEEM) portal was launched in 2020 to bridge the demand-supply gap in the skilled workforce market. The Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Act was passed in 2005. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  Option (c) is the only option encompassing all the correctly matched pairs.  Understanding the timing of these policies is crucial for comprehending the evolution of India's economic landscape and its approach to development.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative                     Primary Aim
1.  Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Swaniyojan Yojana :   Boosting rural entrepreneurship
2.  Atal Innovation Mission (AIM)          :   Promoting financial inclusion
3.  Project “Chunauti”                      :   Supporting startups in Tier-II towns
4.  Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana    :   Improving agricultural productivity
5.  DigiSaksham                            :   Enhancing digital literacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Swaniyojan Yojana is a rural entrepreneurship program, making pair 1 correct. Project “Chunauti” specifically targets startups in smaller Indian cities, thus pair 3 is also correct. DigiSaksham focuses on improving digital skills, aligning with pair 5.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are partially incorrect because they incorrectly associate AIM with financial inclusion, and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana with agricultural productivity.  The Atal Innovation Mission aims to foster innovation and entrepreneurship across sectors, not primarily financial inclusion. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana enhances skill development, not specifically agricultural productivity. Therefore, only option (d) accurately reflects the primary aims of the listed government initiatives.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific government programs and their objectives.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Term                        Description
1.  Inclusive Growth                      :   Growth focused on income redistribution
2.  Amrit Kaal                            :   25-year period leading to India@100
3.  Plug and Play (PM's interpretation) :   Government control over production
4.  Command and Control (1950-1990)      :   Private sector-led development with minimal government intervention
5.  Panch Pran of Amrit Kaal              :   Five commitments for India's future development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Amrit Kaal is indeed the 25-year period leading up to India's centenary in 2047, making pair 2 correct. The Panch Pran are the five commitments outlined by the Prime Minister for this period, accurately described in pair 5.  Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are mismatched. Inclusive growth prioritizes broad-based benefits and equal opportunities, not solely income redistribution. The Prime Minister's interpretation of "Plug and Play" emphasizes private sector participation with government support, the opposite of government control.  "Command and Control" describes a top-down approach to economic planning, not private sector-led development.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched. The question tests understanding of key economic concepts and government policies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                     Characteristic
1.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   Reflects improvement in trade competitiveness
2.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     :   Indicates rupee appreciation
3.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)            :   Higher weightage for services than WPI
4.  Wholesale Price Index (WPI)           :   Higher weightage for food than CPI
5.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)          :   Compares prices of goods across countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 3 correctly states that the CPI gives higher weightage to services compared to the WPI.  Pair 5 accurately describes PPP as a method for comparing the prices of identical goods and services across different countries. The other pairs are incorrect.  An increase in NEER indicates a weakening, not a strengthening, of the domestic currency, and an increase in REER does suggest improvement in trade competitiveness.  The WPI doesn't have a higher weightage for food than CPI, it's the other way around. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of macroeconomic indicators and their interpretations. The difficulty arises from the subtle differences between closely related concepts.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                Characteristic
1.  Commercial Paper                   :   Long-term instrument issued by RBI
2.  Certificate of Deposit               :   Short-term unsecured promissory note
3.  Call Money                           :   Used for interbank transactions
4.  Zero Coupon Bonds                   :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds
5.  Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme          :   Promotes FDI in gold and jewelry sector


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Call money is indeed a short-term financial instrument used primarily for interbank transactions to manage short-term liquidity needs. The other pairs are incorrect because they mischaracterize the instruments.  Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note, not a long-term instrument issued by the RBI. Certificates of Deposit are issued by banks, not the RBI, and are typically short- to medium-term. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; their return comes from the difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme aims to bring idle gold into the economy and reduce reliance on imports, not to promote FDI in the gold and jewelry sector.  This question tests knowledge of financial instruments and their characteristics, requiring precise understanding of their definitions and uses.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Institution                  Function/Role
1.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)           :   Supervises Urban Cooperative Banks
2.  National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :   Launched RuPay card payment scheme
3.  Small Finance Banks (SFBs)           :   Primarily cater to large corporations
4.  Commercial Banks                     :   Do not hold deposits as assets
5.  Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) :   Invest directly in government securities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The RBI plays a significant supervisory role over Urban Cooperative Banks, making pair 1 correct.  NPCI did indeed launch the RuPay card payment scheme, which is an important initiative for financial inclusion and domestic payment systems, making pair 2 correct.  Pairs 3, 4, and 5 are incorrect.  SFBs are designed to serve small businesses and marginal farmers, not large corporations.  Deposits are a major component of commercial bank assets. FIIs do not directly invest in government securities but rather in equities and other securities.  This question tests knowledge of financial institutions and their functions within the Indian financial system.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept/Policy                      Impact/Effect
1.  Money Multiplier                    :   Decreases with higher cash reserve ratio
2.  Devaluation of Currency              :   Increases the foreign value of domestic currency
3.  Demand-pull inflation               :   Reduced by expansionary monetary policies
4.  Capital Account Convertibility       :   Increases vulnerability to global financial crises
5.  Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)         :   Incentive given by the government to merchants


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A higher cash reserve ratio directly reduces the money multiplier because banks have less money to lend, making pair 1 correct. Full capital account convertibility increases a country's susceptibility to global financial shocks, thus pair 4 is also correct.  Pairs 2, 3, and 5 are incorrect. Devaluation makes a currency less valuable internationally. Demand-pull inflation is exacerbated, not reduced, by expansionary policies. MDR is a charge levied by banks on merchants, not a government incentive.  This question tests the understanding of economic concepts and their practical implications.  The accurate matching requires a deep understanding of monetary policy, international finance, and the banking sector.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Yojana                      Target Beneficiary
1.  Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana         :   Old and destitute persons
2.  Kisan Credit Card Scheme            :   Small entrepreneurs
3.  Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana :   Poor farmers
4.  National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS):   IT professionals
5.  PRIME (Programme for Reskilling/Upskilling of IT Manpower for Employability) :   Apprentices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana aims to provide funding to micro and small entrepreneurs, making pair 2 correct. The Kisan Credit Card scheme provides credit support to farmers, thus pair 3 is also correct. The other pairs are mismatched. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana doesn't target the elderly. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana focuses on skill development, not solely on farmers.  NAPS targets apprentices, not IT professionals, and PRIME specifically aims to upskill IT professionals.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of government schemes and their target beneficiaries.  The correct matching requires familiarity with specific details of various social welfare and economic development programs.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Infrastructure Project               Objective/Characteristic
1.  Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) :   Focuses primarily on agricultural development
2.  Bangalore-Mumbai Economic Corridor (BMEC):   Connects economic hubs with efficient transport
3.  Chennai-Bangalore Industrial Corridor (CBIC):   Does not include planned urbanization
4.  Sagarmala Project                   :   Aims to reduce logistics costs for domestic and EXIM cargo
5.  Special Economic Zones (SEZs)       :   Treat domestic sales within SEZs as exports


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The BMEC and other industrial corridors aim to improve connectivity between economic hubs with efficient transport systems, making pair 2 correct.  The Sagarmala project's main objective is to reduce logistics costs, making pair 4 correct. The other pairs are mismatched. DMIC is not primarily focused on agriculture; it aims to boost industrial development.  Planned urbanization is an integral part of industrial corridor development.  Domestic sales within SEZs are treated as imports, not exports. This question tests knowledge of major infrastructure projects and their characteristics, requiring familiarity with their objectives and implementation details. The difficulty stems from the need to accurately recall the specific features of each project and avoid common misconceptions.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy/Resolution        Year of Adoption
1. Industrial Policy Resolution 1948 : 1956
2. Industrial Policy Resolution 1956 : 1948
3.  Special Economic Zone (SEZ) policy in India : 2000
4. India’s first EPZ  : 1965

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 laid the foundation for India's industrial development post-independence.  The Industrial Policy Resolution 1956, adopted during the Second Five-Year Plan, categorized industries and outlined the role of the public and private sectors.  The SEZ policy was indeed formulated in 2000 to attract foreign investment and boost exports. India's first Export Processing Zone (EPZ) was established in 1965. Option (d) accurately reflects these facts. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly jumble the years associated with the industrial policy resolutions and the establishment of the EPZ.  Understanding the historical context of these policies is crucial for analyzing India's economic development trajectory. The question tests factual recall regarding key economic policies and their timelines.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                      Definition/Characteristic
1. Import Substitution                 :  Encouraging domestic production to replace imports
2. Tariff                               :   A tax on imported goods
3. Quota                               :   Restriction on the quantity of goods imported
4.  Disinvestment                      :  Government's sale of its stake in Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Import substitution is a trade strategy where a country prioritizes domestic production over imports. Tariffs are taxes levied on imported goods to make them more expensive and less competitive with domestic products. Quotas are quantitative restrictions limiting the amount of a particular good that can be imported. Disinvestment refers to the government's partial or full sale of its ownership in PSUs.  All four pairs are correctly matched.  Understanding these terms is essential for analyzing trade and economic policies. The question tests the candidate's conceptual understanding of trade policies and their mechanisms.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sector                  Contribution to GDP in 1990-91 (%)
1. Agriculture             : 59.0
2. Industry                : 24.6
3. Services                : 40.5

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question tests factual recall of India's sectoral GDP contribution in 1990-91.  While the service sector did see significant growth, its contribution to GDP in 1990-91 was not as high as 40.5%. Similarly, agriculture's contribution was significantly higher than what's presented in option 1. Only the figure for industry's contribution to GDP (24.6%) is accurate.  Understanding sectoral shifts in GDP is crucial for assessing the overall economic development of a nation.  The distractors are designed to test the accuracy of the candidate's recall of data and their ability to identify the correct information amidst plausible-but-incorrect alternatives.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Reform Measure        Intended Outcome
1.  Removal of Fertilizer Subsidy  : Reduce the cost of agricultural production
2.  Reduction in Import Duties     :  Protect domestic industries from foreign competition
3.  Disinvestment of PSUs        : Improve financial discipline and modernization of PSUs
4.  Promoting Value Added Exports : Increase the competitiveness of Indian goods

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The removal of fertilizer subsidies aimed to reduce government expenditure and increase efficiency in resource allocation, not to directly reduce the cost of production for farmers.  Lower import duties are meant to increase competition, not protect domestic industries. Disinvestment of PSUs aimed to improve financial discipline and facilitate modernization. Promoting value-added exports seeks to increase competitiveness by focusing on higher-value products. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to analyze the intended outcomes of various economic reform measures and identify the correct cause-and-effect relationships.  The inclusion of incorrect pairs tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of these policies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Public Sector Undertaking (PSU)         Sector
1. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC)         :  Steel
2. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) :  Telecommunications
3. Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL)       :  Steel
4. Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL)       :  Telecommunications
5. Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL)    :  Oil and Natural Gas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual knowledge about Indian PSUs and their respective sectors.  IOC, BPCL, and GAIL operate in the oil and natural gas sector. SAIL is in the steel sector. VSNL is in telecommunications.  Therefore, options 1 and 2 are mismatched. Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings.  The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of PSU operations and sectoral classifications.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                          Function Related to Exporters
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)           : Providing insurance against various risks to exporters
2. State Trading Corporation of India     : Providing insurance against various risks to exporters
3. EXIM Bank                             : Providing insurance against various risks to exporters
4. Export Credit and Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) : Providing insurance against various risks to exporters

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses knowledge of organizations involved in supporting Indian exporters.  While RBI, STC, and EXIM Bank play roles in the economy, ECGC is the specific organization that provides insurance against various risks to exporters.  The other options are incorrect because they attribute the function of risk insurance to organizations that do not primarily fulfill that role.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between the functions of different economic organizations.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Public Sector Undertaking (PSU)    Status Granted
1.  Navaratna PSU                      : Mini-Ratna Status
2. Mini-Ratna PSU                     : Navaratna Status
3. Profit-making PSU                   :  Navaratna or Mini-Ratna Status

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question focuses on the classification of PSUs based on performance and autonomy. Navaratna status denotes higher autonomy and operational freedom compared to Mini-Ratna status.  Profitable PSUs could be granted either Navaratna or Mini-Ratna status.  Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly swap the statuses.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests the understanding of the public sector classification system and its rationale. The distractors highlight potential confusion between the two PSU statuses.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                               Description
1. Inclusive Growth                       : Focuses solely on income redistribution
2. Pro-poor Growth (absolute definition) : Poor people benefit in absolute terms
3. Pro-poor Growth (relative definition) : Incomes of the poor grow faster than the population as a whole

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Inclusive growth is a broader concept than just income redistribution; it includes aspects like opportunity, capability, access, and security.  The absolute definition of pro-poor growth focuses on whether poor people benefit in absolute terms, irrespective of changes in inequality. The relative definition focuses on whether the income of the poor grows faster than the overall population, indicating a reduction in inequality.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the different approaches to economic development and poverty reduction.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Related Issue                  Description
1. Agricultural Subsidies             : Developing countries are not allowed access to developed country markets
2. Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs)        : Stringent quality standards restricting market access
3. Quantitative Restrictions (QRs)   :  Removal of these on imports by India as per WTO commitments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question tests understanding of issues related to the WTO and its impact on developing countries.  Developed countries' agricultural subsidies often distort global markets, hindering developing countries' access.  NTBs, including stringent quality standards, act as barriers to market access. India has indeed removed QRs on imports as part of its WTO commitments.  All three pairs are correctly matched. The question assesses understanding of the complexities of international trade and the challenges faced by developing countries within the WTO framework.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Policy/Scheme           Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) : Covers only pre-harvest losses
2. Soil Health Card Scheme                : Expanding the cultivable area under irrigation
3. National Agriculture Market (NAM)      : Provides farmers access to a nationwide market

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PMFBY covers both pre- and post-harvest losses. The Soil Health Card Scheme aims to improve soil health and fertilizer use, not to expand irrigated land. NAM indeed aims to provide farmers with access to a nationwide market.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of specific agricultural policies and their objectives.  The incorrect options highlight potential misconceptions about these schemes.  This question demands precise knowledge of government schemes.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Commodity          Major Producing State(s)
1. Groundnut                      : Andhra Pradesh
2. Rice                             : Punjab and Haryana
3.  Bananas                         : Kerala
4.  Marine Products                 : Kerala, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Andhra Pradesh is a major groundnut producer. Punjab and Haryana are significant rice-producing states. Kerala is known for banana cultivation.  Kerala, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu are major producers of marine products. All the pairs are correctly matched. The question tests knowledge of India's agricultural geography and major producing regions for various commodities.  The options are designed to test the candidate's geographical awareness.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Instrument               Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                 : Long-term secured promissory note
2. Certificate of Deposit             : Short-term instrument issued by commercial banks
3. Call Money                         : Short-term interbank transaction financing
4. Zero Coupon Bonds                 : Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by commercial banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note. Certificates of Deposit are short-term instruments issued by banks. Call money is indeed used for short-term interbank transactions. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; the return is the difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity. Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The question tests knowledge of financial instruments and their characteristics.  The incorrect options highlight potential misconceptions about these instruments.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution              Role/Function
1. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)       : Primarily cater to large corporations
2. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) : Promotes financial inclusion
3. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)       :  Does not regulate Urban Cooperative Banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

SFBs are designed to serve small businesses and individuals, not large corporations. NPCI plays a crucial role in promoting financial inclusion through various payment systems. RBI does regulate Urban Cooperative Banks.  Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of the roles and functions of different financial institutions in India. The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of each institution’s mandate.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term Related to Currency/Exchange Rates  Description
1. Devaluation of a currency              : Increases the foreign value of domestic currency
2. Money Multiplier                      : Increases with an increase in the cash reserve ratio
3. Masala Bonds                          : Rupee-denominated bonds issued by Indian borrowers
4. Capital Account Convertibility         :  Restriction on the free flow of capital

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Devaluation decreases the foreign value of domestic currency. The money multiplier is inversely related to the cash reserve ratio. Masala Bonds are indeed rupee-denominated bonds issued by Indian borrowers. Capital account convertibility implies free flow of capital. Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests understanding of concepts related to exchange rates, monetary policy, and capital flows. The incorrect options highlight potential confusions between related concepts.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Yojana         Primary Target Beneficiary
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana      : Old and destitute persons
2. Kisan Credit Card Scheme           : Small and marginal farmers
3. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme       : Foreign Institutional Investors

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

MUDRA Yojana targets small entrepreneurs. Kisan Credit Card Scheme provides credit support to farmers. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme aims to mobilize domestic gold holdings. Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of government schemes and their target beneficiaries.  The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's precise understanding of the schemes' objectives.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                      Description
1.  Merchant Discount Rate                 :   The incentive given by a bank to a merchant for accepting payments through debit cards pertaining to that bank.
2.  Legal Tender Money                     :   The money which a creditor is under compulsion to accept in settlement of his claims
3.  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)          :   The amount that banks have to maintain in the form of their own funds to offset any loss that banks incur if the account-holders fail to repay dues.
4.  Masala Bonds                           :   Rupee denominated bonds issued by Indian borrowers to raise capital in international markets.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 correctly defines Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).  CAR is indeed the ratio of a bank's capital to its risk-weighted credit exposures. It's a crucial regulatory requirement designed to protect banks from insolvency.  Statement 1 incorrectly describes Merchant Discount Rate (MDR); MDR is the fee a merchant pays to a bank for processing card payments, not an incentive. Statement 2 misrepresents legal tender money; legal tender is the currency that a creditor *must* accept in payment of a debt.  Statement 4 is incorrect; Masala Bonds are rupee-denominated bonds issued in international markets, not necessarily by Indian borrowers alone.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                  Primary Aim
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana           :   Providing loans to poor farmers for cultivating particular crops
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme             :   To promote FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
3. Kisan Credit Card Scheme               :   Construction of family house and setting up of village cold storage facility
4.  Government’s Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme: To reduce India’s dependence on gold imports

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 accurately reflects the purpose of the combined Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme. These schemes aim to mobilize idle gold held by households, thereby reducing reliance on gold imports and increasing domestic gold reserves.  Statement 1 is incorrect; MUDRA Yojana targets small entrepreneurs, not solely farmers. Statement 2 is wrong; the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme primarily aims to bring domestic gold into the financial system, not to attract FDI. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Kisan Credit Card Scheme provides short-term credit for agricultural inputs and expenses, not for construction or cold storage setup.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                              Description
1.  Money Multiplier                          :   Increases with an increase in the cash reserve ratio
2.  Demand-pull Inflation                    :   Caused by rising interest rates
3.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)           :   Investment through capital instruments essentially in a listed company
4.  Reserve Tranche Position (RTP)          :   Acts as debt on member country


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The money multiplier is inversely related to the cash reserve ratio (CRR); a higher CRR leads to a lower multiplier. Demand-pull inflation is driven by increased aggregate demand, not rising interest rates (which are generally contractionary). FDI is not exclusively about investment in listed companies; it encompasses various forms of direct investment.  RTP is a portion of a country's quota in the IMF that it can use at its discretion, not a debt.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution                               Function
1.  National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :   Launched RuPay, a card payment scheme
2.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)            :   Manages and services only Government of India Securities, not State Government Securities
3.  Small Finance Banks (SFBs)              :   To encourage young entrepreneurs to set up business particularly in rural areas.
4.  Food Corporation of India (FCI)           :   Outsourcing its stocking operations to various agencies such as Central Warehousing Corporation, State Warehousing Corporation, Private Sector


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. NPCI did indeed launch RuPay. RBI manages both central and state government securities. FCI does outsource its stocking operations. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while SFBs do aim to provide credit to small businesses, their primary focus is not exclusively on encouraging young entrepreneurs in rural areas.  Their mandate is broader than that.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                   Description
1.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)           :   In terms of PPP dollars, India is the sixth largest economy in the world
2.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)              :   The weight age of food in CPI is lower than that in Wholesale Price Index (WPI).
3.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   An increase indicates the depreciation of rupee.
4.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)      :  An increase indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct. While PPP is used to compare economies across countries, India's ranking might vary based on the data source and year. The weight of food in CPI is generally higher than in WPI. An increase in NEER indicates appreciation, not depreciation, of the domestic currency. An increase in REER does not always indicate improved trade competitiveness; it depends on other factors as well.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                                   Feature
1.  National Food Security Act, 2013         :  Families coming under the category of 'below poverty line (BPL)' only are eligible to receive subsidized grains.
2.  One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC)     :  Enables migrant workers and their family members to buy subsidized ration from any fair price shop anywhere in the country under the NFSA.
3.  Shanta Kumar Committee Recommendations :  Recommends to have a relook at the current coverage of 67 percent of population under NFSA.
4.  National Food Security Act, 2013         : Pregnant women and lactating mothers are entitled to a take-home ration of 1600 calories per day during pregnancy and for six months thereafter.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. ONORC facilitates nationwide portability of ration cards. The Shanta Kumar Committee did recommend reviewing the NFSA coverage.  The NFSA does provide extra rations for pregnant women and lactating mothers. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the NFSA includes both BPL and APL families, not only BPL.  The eligibility criteria are broader than just BPL status.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Indicator                         Characteristic
1.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)              :  Calculated by adding up the value of all goods and services produced by all the firms in an economy
2.  Net National Product (NNP)               :  Evaluated at market prices includes indirect taxes.
3.  Personal Income (PI)                      :  Includes Undistributed Profits
4.  Personal Disposable Income (PDI)         :  Includes Personal Tax Payments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correctly matched. GDP is indeed calculated by summing the value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders. Statement 2 is incorrect; NNP at market prices *includes* indirect taxes, but NNP at factor cost excludes them. Statement 3 is incorrect; PI excludes undistributed profits. Statement 4 is incorrect; PDI excludes personal tax payments.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    WTO Agreement                                 Feature
1.  Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) : Allows countries to set their own standards based on science.
2.  Agreement on Agriculture (AoA)              :  Classifies domestic support into Green Box, Amber Box, and Blue Box categories.
3.  Information Technology Agreement (ITA)        :  Requires each participant to eliminate and bind customs duties at zero for all products specified in the Agreement.
4.  Countervailing Duty                          :  Applied when there is a surge in imports of a particular product irrespective of a particular country/ies.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe the features of the respective WTO agreements. The SPS agreement emphasizes science-based standards, AoA uses the box system for domestic support, and ITA mandates zero tariffs on IT products.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; countervailing duties are applied specifically to offset subsidies given by exporting countries, not to general import surges. Safeguard duties address general import surges.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    IMF/World Bank Feature                        Description
1.  World Bank Objective                        : To promote international monetary cooperation
2.  IMF Source of Funds                         : Issuance of bonds in international financial markets
3.  World Bank Lending                           : Usually conditional short-term loans to all member countries
4.  IMF Votes                                   : Votes = Basic votes + 1 vote for each Quota of SDR one lakh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The World Bank does raise funds through bond issuances. The IMF's voting system is indeed based on quotas.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the World Bank's objective is primarily development and poverty reduction, not international monetary cooperation (that's the IMF's primary role). Statement 3 is incorrect; the World Bank typically provides long-term loans, not short-term conditional loans, which is the IMF's lending approach.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Macroeconomic Variable                     Characteristic
1.  Real GDP                                   :  Calculated using constant prices to compare GDP across different time periods.
2.  GDP Deflator                              :  The ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP
3.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)                 :  Includes prices of goods consumed by the representative consumer, including imported goods.
4.  Wholesale Price Index (WPI)               :   Also known as Producer Price Index (PPI) in countries like the USA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correctly matched. Real GDP uses constant prices for comparison. The GDP deflator is the ratio of nominal to real GDP. CPI includes both domestically produced and imported goods consumed by the representative consumer. And WPI is indeed also known as PPI in some countries.  There are no inaccuracies in any of the provided pairings.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Industrial Corridor                     Partner Country
1. Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) :   China
2. Chennai-Bangalore Industrial Corridor (CBIC) :   Germany
3. Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor (AKIC)  :   Japan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor (AKIC) is being developed in collaboration with Japan.  The other pairings are incorrect. While the DMIC has significant international collaborations,  China is not the primary partner country.  Similarly, Germany is not the primary partner country for the CBIC. The question tests factual recall about the specific partner countries associated with major Indian industrial corridors, requiring detailed knowledge beyond general awareness. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings, serving as effective distractors, making the question challenging and demanding precise knowledge.  The correct answer, (c), highlights the importance of understanding the specific international partnerships driving India's infrastructural development.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Zone Type                      Characteristic Feature
1. Special Economic Zone (SEZ)            :   Treated as deemed foreign territory for trade operations
2. Coastal Economic Zone (CEZ)           :   Focuses primarily on inland manufacturing
3. Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) :   Envisages development of 100 Smart Cities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are indeed treated as deemed foreign territory for trade operations, duties, and tariffs. This is a core characteristic of SEZs, designed to attract foreign investment and boost exports.  The DMIC's plan to develop 100 Smart Cities is also a well-documented feature.  However, Coastal Economic Zones (CEZs) are focused on coastal development and leveraging port infrastructure for economic growth, not primarily on inland manufacturing.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of distinct economic zone types and their primary characteristics. Options (a), (c), and (d) include mismatched pairs, effectively testing the candidate's ability to differentiate and accurately recall the specific features of each zone type. This makes the question challenging and requires detailed knowledge of India's economic geography and policy.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative                     Primary Goal
1. Sagarmala Project                        :   Enhance inland waterway transportation
2. Make in India                              :   Increase manufacturing's share in GDP to 25% by 2025
3. Stand-up India Scheme                    :   Encourage entrepreneurship among SC/STs and women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Make in India initiative explicitly aims to increase the manufacturing sector's contribution to India's GDP, targeting a 25% share by 2025.  The Stand-up India Scheme's primary goal is to promote entrepreneurship amongst Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and women entrepreneurs.  However, the Sagarmala Project's primary focus is on enhancing port-led development and maritime logistics, not solely on inland waterway transportation, although it does encompass improvements to inland waterways as part of a broader strategy. The question tests the candidates' understanding of the objectives of major government initiatives, requiring precise knowledge and the ability to distinguish between the primary and secondary goals of each program. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect or incomplete pairings, acting as effective distractors to gauge the candidate's in-depth understanding.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding challenges faced by India's manufacturing sector:**

1. Low labour productivity compared to global competitors.

5. Casual Wage Labourers (1972-73)         : 23.2%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses the understanding of employment status distribution over time. Option (c) is correct because it accurately reflects the workforce distribution across self-employed, regular salaried employees, and casual wage laborers in 1999-2000 and also in 1972-73. In 1999-2000, self-employment constituted 52.6%, regular salaried employment 14.6%, and casual wage labor 32.8%.  The data also shows a shift in employment patterns from 1972-73 to 1999-2000, where the proportion of self-employed decreased slightly, while casual wage labor increased significantly. This demonstrates a trend of increasing informality in the Indian labor market. Other options are incorrect because they either miss some correct pairings or include incorrect data. Analyzing these trends is crucial for understanding the changing nature of work and the challenges faced by Indian workers.

(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

This question tests the understanding of the classification of economic activities. Option (b) is the correct answer because it correctly classifies the examples into their respective sectors. Fishing and agriculture fall under the primary sector, which involves extraction of raw materials from nature. Construction and transportation are part of the secondary and tertiary sectors respectively. Manufacturing is also a secondary sector activity.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly classify at least one economic activity, therefore, they are incorrect. This understanding of economic sector classification is fundamental to analyzing economic data and development strategies.



**5. With reference to the Indian workforce in 1999-2000, consider the following pairs:**

   Sector                     Percentage of Women Workers
1. Formal Sector              : 17%
2. Informal Sector            : 31%
3. Primary Sector             : 76%
4. Secondary Sector           : 12%
5. Tertiary Sector            : 24%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question focuses on the gendered distribution of the workforce across sectors. Option (a) is correct because it correctly identifies the proportion of women in the formal sector and primary sector. In 1999-2000, women constituted approximately 17% of the formal sector workforce and about 76% of the primary sector. The other percentages given for women in other sectors are incorrect.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of at least one mismatched pair. The data reveals significant gender disparities in employment, particularly the overrepresentation of women in the primary sector and their underrepresentation in the formal sector. This understanding is crucial for designing policies promoting gender equality in the Indian workforce.


**6. With reference to employment in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Unemployment      Description
1. Open Unemployment        :  People actively seeking work but unable to find it.

5. Disguised Unemployment  : Workers receiving fair wages.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question deals with different types of unemployment prevalent in India. Option (a) is correct as it accurately defines open, disguised, and seasonal unemployment. Open unemployment refers to individuals actively seeking work but unable to find it. Disguised unemployment occurs when more workers than necessary are employed in a task, leading to reduced individual productivity. Seasonal unemployment arises when work is only available during specific periods, like agricultural work.  Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect statement that people working less than an hour are considered openly unemployed. Options (b) and (c) are incomplete. Understanding these types of unemployment is vital for developing effective employment policies.


**7. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Sector           Characteristics
1. Agriculture              :  Largest share of GDP at independence.
2. Industry                 :  Least share of GDP at independence.
3. Services                  :  Significant growth after 1991 reforms.
4. Agriculture              :  Largest employer in 1999-2000.
5. Industry                 :  Consistent 12-14% annual growth since 2014.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses understanding of the historical and contemporary characteristics of different economic sectors in India. Option (b) is correct because it correctly matches three pairs. At independence, agriculture held the largest share of India's GDP. The services sector experienced significant growth following the 1991 economic reforms.  Agriculture remained the largest employer in 1999-2000. The other pairings are incorrect.  Option (d) is incorrect because it claims a consistent 12-14% annual growth for the industry sector since 2014, which is not entirely accurate. The other options are also incorrect due to mismatched pairs.  Understanding the evolution of these sectors is key to understanding India’s economic development.


**8. With reference to the "Make in India" initiative, consider the following pairs:**

   Challenge                          Description
1. Low Labour Productivity          :  Indian manufacturing workers are significantly less productive than their counterparts in countries like China and Thailand.
2. FDI Inflow                         : Primarily from direct foreign investment sources.
3. Labour Laws                        :  Outdated laws hinder ease of doing business.
4. Infrastructure                     : Adequate railway network for efficient freight transportation.
5. Land Acquisition                   :  Rapid and streamlined processes.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only

(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question evaluates the knowledge of challenges faced by the "Make in India" initiative. Option (a) is correct, accurately describing two key challenges.  Low labor productivity in India's manufacturing sector is a significant issue compared to other countries. Outdated labor laws create obstacles for businesses. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair. The FDI inflow is not primarily from direct foreign investments, but includes significant investments from shell companies.  The infrastructure and land acquisition processes are not efficient as implied in the other options.  Understanding these challenges is crucial for evaluating the success and future prospects of "Make in India."


**9. With reference to the Industrial Policy Resolution 1956 (IPR 1956), consider the following pairs:**

   Industry Category                  Government Control
1. Category 1                         : Exclusive state ownership.
2. Category 2                         : State and private sector collaboration.
3. Category 3                         : Private sector only, with no licensing.
4. All Categories                     : Subject to licensing for expansion.
5. Category 3                         :  Complete state control.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question focuses on the classification of industries under the IPR 1956. Option (a) is correct because it correctly identifies the government's control over the industry categories. Category 1 industries were under exclusive state ownership. Category 2 allowed for state-private collaboration, while Category 3 was for the private sector.  Importantly, licensing was required for expansion across all categories. Option (c) is incorrect as it incorrectly states that category 3 had no licensing. Options (b) and (d) are incomplete.  Understanding the IPR 1956 is crucial for analyzing India's post-independence industrial policy.


**10. With reference to India's economic development, consider the following pairs:**

   Stage of Development            Economic Characteristics
1. Early Stages                      :  Emphasis on basic infrastructure.
2. Mature Economies                  :  Greater share of service-related infrastructure.
3. Post-Independence Era (initial) :  Dominance of the agricultural sector in GDP.
4. Post-1991 Reforms Era            :  Significant growth in the services sector.
5. Post-2014 Era                     :  Consistent high growth in the manufacturing sector.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the understanding of the evolution of India's economy across different stages of development. Option (c) is correct. In the early stages of development, the focus was on building basic infrastructure like irrigation and transportation. Mature economies typically see a larger proportion of service-related infrastructure.  Post-independence India saw the agricultural sector dominate GDP. The post-1991 reform era saw significant growth in the services sector. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes an inaccurate claim of consistent high growth in manufacturing since 2014.  The other options are incomplete. Understanding these phases is essential for analyzing India's economic strategy.


**1. With reference to macroeconomic indicators, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                    Description
    1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :  Reflects the improvement in trade competitiveness
    2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)      :  Indicates the appreciation of the rupee
    3. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)           :  Compares prices of a basket of goods across countries

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct matching is only for pair 3. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries. This allows for a more accurate comparison of economic output and living standards across nations, adjusting for differences in price levels.

Pair 1 is incorrect. An increase in NEER signifies a strengthening of the domestic currency relative to a basket of other currencies, not necessarily an improvement in trade competitiveness.  Trade competitiveness is better reflected in REER, which accounts for inflation differentials.

Pair 2 is incorrect.  An increase in the REER indicates a *decline* in trade competitiveness, as the domestic currency becomes more expensive relative to other currencies, making exports less attractive and imports more attractive.  An appreciation of the rupee is indicated by an increase in NEER, not REER.


**2. With reference to economic growth and development, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                     Indicator
    1. Higher level of economic development    :  Increase in absolute and per capita real GNP
    2. Capital formation inefficiency           :  High capital-output ratio
    3. Pro-poor growth (absolute definition)   :  Incomes of poor grow faster than overall population income

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. A high capital-output ratio indicates that a significant amount of capital investment is required to generate a unit of output. This signifies inefficiency in capital formation, as resources are not being used productively.

Pair 1 is incorrect because increases in absolute and per capita real GNP are not sufficient conditions for higher economic development.  Poverty, unemployment, and inequality can still exist despite high GNP.  Economic development encompasses broader social and human indicators beyond just economic output.

Pair 3 is incorrect because the absolute definition of pro-poor growth focuses on whether poor people benefit in absolute terms, irrespective of whether their income growth is faster or slower than the overall population's.


**3. With reference to economic indices and inflation, consider the following pairs:**

    Index                                        Characteristic
    1. Consumer Price Index (CPI)                :  Lower weightage for food items compared to WPI
    2. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)              :  Captures changes in service prices
    3.  Money Multiplier                         : Increase with higher Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The CPI typically gives a higher weightage to food items than the WPI, reflecting the higher proportion of income spent on food by a typical consumer.

Pair 2 is incorrect.  The WPI primarily focuses on wholesale prices of goods and does not comprehensively capture changes in service prices, which are better reflected in the CPI.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The money multiplier is inversely related to the CRR. A higher CRR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thereby decreasing the money multiplier.


**4. With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Scheme                       Purpose
    1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana          :  Providing loans to poor farmers for specific crops
    2. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)           : Primarily focused on encouraging young entrepreneurs in rural areas
    3.  Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme          :  Promoting FDI in the gold and jewellery sector

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing them with loans, not specifically for poor farmers cultivating particular crops.

Pair 2 is incorrect. While SFBs do provide credit to small businesses, their primary purpose is not solely focused on encouraging young entrepreneurs in rural areas.  They cater to a wider range of small businesses and individuals.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme aims to bring idle gold from households into the economy and reduce reliance on gold imports.  It does not directly promote FDI in the gold and jewelry sector.


**5. With reference to financial instruments and markets, consider the following pairs:**

    Instrument/Concept                         Characteristic
    1. Commercial Paper                         :  A long-term unsecured promissory note
    2. Certificate of Deposit                    :  Issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks to corporations
    3.  Call Money                               :  Used for interbank transactions

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Certificates of Deposit are indeed short-term instruments issued by banks to corporations, and call money is a short-term borrowing used for interbank transactions.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds.


**6. With reference to foreign investment in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Investment Type                          Characteristic
    1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)        : Investment less than 10% of equity capital of a listed company
    2. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)     : Investment involving debt servicing
    3.  Overseas Direct Investment (ODI)      :  Investment made by Indian companies abroad


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Overseas Direct Investment (ODI) does refer to investments made by Indian companies in foreign countries.

Pair 1 is incorrect. FDI is defined as investment of 10% or more in equity capital of a listed company or investment in an unlisted company.

Pair 2 is incorrect. FPI is mainly equity investment and does not inherently involve debt servicing.  Debt-servicing is associated with debt-based investments.


**7. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect                                      Fact
    1. RBI Governor Appointment                 : Appointed by the State Governments
    2. RBI's Power Source                       :  Derived from the Indian Constitution
    3. Government Directives to RBI             :  Issued by the Central Government in public interest

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Central Government does have the power to issue directions to the RBI in public interest, as enshrined in certain constitutional provisions.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The RBI Governor is appointed by the Central Government, not the State Governments.

Pair 2 is incorrect. While the RBI Act governs the RBI's functions, its ultimate power and authority are not derived directly from the Indian Constitution.  The Constitution empowers the Parliament to establish a central bank, but the details of its operation are in the RBI Act.


**8. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect                                      Fact
    1. Supervision and Regulation              : By local boards set up by State Governments
    2. Share Issuance                           : Can issue only equity shares
    3.  Banking Regulation Act, 1949             : Brought under its purview by an amendment in 1999

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Urban Cooperative Banks are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not local boards set up by State Governments.

Pair 2 is incorrect. Urban Cooperative Banks can issue both equity and preference shares.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The amendment bringing Urban Cooperative Banks under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, occurred in 1966, not 1999.


**9. With reference to factors influencing Indian Government Bond Yields, consider the following pairs:**

    Factor                                      Influence
    1. Actions of the United States Federal Reserve:  Direct and immediate impact
    2. Actions of the Reserve Bank of India     : Indirect and minimal impact
    3. Inflation and short-term interest rates  :  Significant influence


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Inflation and short-term interest rates are major determinants of government bond yields. Higher inflation generally leads to higher yields as investors demand higher returns to compensate for the erosion of purchasing power.  Similarly, rising short-term interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding bonds, leading to higher yields.

Pair 1 is incorrect. While global factors, including actions of the US Federal Reserve, can indirectly influence Indian bond yields, their impact is not direct or immediate.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The RBI's actions, such as its monetary policy decisions, have a significant impact on bond yields.


**10. With reference to components of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Investment Type                          Characteristic
    1. Foreign currency convertible bonds      : Included in FDI
    2. Foreign institutional investment         :  Always included in FDI
    3. Global depository receipts              : Included in FDI

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) are a form of FDI as they represent ownership in a foreign company.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Foreign currency convertible bonds are not considered FDI, as they are debt instruments, not equity investments.

Pair 2 is incorrect. Foreign institutional investment is considered FPI, not FDI, unless it meets the criteria for FDI (such as exceeding 10% ownership).


**11. With reference to the effects of currency devaluation, consider the following pairs:**

    Effect                                    Outcome
    1. Improves competitiveness of exports     : Always results in improved trade balance
    2. Increases foreign value of domestic currency:  A necessary outcome
    3. Improves trade balance                  : A likely, but not guaranteed, outcome


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Devaluation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, which can improve the trade balance. However, this is not guaranteed, as other factors (like global demand, supply elasticity) can also influence the trade balance.

Pair 1 is incorrect. While devaluation makes exports more competitive, it does not guarantee an improved trade balance.

Pair 2 is incorrect. Devaluation, by definition, *decreases* the foreign value of the domestic currency.  It is a deliberate policy to make the currency less valuable.


**12. With reference to demand-pull inflation in the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

    Factor                                     Effect
    1. Expansionary policies                   : Causes demand-pull inflation
    2. Fiscal stimulus                         : Increases demand-pull inflation
    3. Rising interest rates                     : Increases demand-pull inflation


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2 and 3 only
    (d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies increase aggregate demand, which can lead to demand-pull inflation.  Fiscal stimulus, in particular, increases government spending, boosting demand.

Pair 3 is incorrect. Rising interest rates are a *contractionary* policy aimed at curbing inflation by reducing borrowing and spending.  They counteract demand-pull inflation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                      Definition/Description
1.  Rural Development                        :   Improving infrastructure in rural areas, diversification of activities, and promoting organic farming.
2.  Agricultural Diversification            :   Shifting from solely crop production to allied activities like livestock and non-agricultural sectors.
3.  Formal Sector Employment                :   Employment in public sector establishments and private sector firms with 10 or more hired workers.
4.  Informal Sector Employment              :   Employment in enterprises with fewer than 10 hired workers, including self-employed individuals.
5.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)           :   The total money value of all goods and services produced within a country's domestic territory in a year.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Rural development encompasses infrastructure improvement, diversification into non-agricultural activities, and a growing focus on sustainable practices like organic farming. Agricultural diversification is a crucial strategy for reducing reliance on a single income source and enhancing rural livelihoods. The formal sector, as defined by employment regulations, includes larger organizations offering social security benefits.  The informal sector comprises smaller businesses and self-employment, often lacking formal protections.  Finally, GDP accurately reflects the total value of goods and services produced domestically within a specified period.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of these definitions within the context provided.  All options other than (c) incorrectly exclude one or more of the accurately matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                     Description
1.  Jobless Growth                         :   Increase in GDP without a corresponding rise in employment opportunities.
2.  Casualisation of Workforce             :   Shift from self-employment and regular salaried jobs to casual wage labor.
3.  Import Substitution                     :   Replacing imports with domestically produced goods to protect local industries.
4.  Minimum Support Price (MSP)           :   Government-guaranteed minimum price for certain agricultural products.
5.  Production Linked Incentive (PLI)      :  Incentives provided to companies based on their incremental sales of domestically manufactured products.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately describe the given economic indicators. Jobless growth is a phenomenon where economic growth doesn't translate into job creation. Casualization of the workforce describes the increasing trend of temporary or contract-based employment. Import substitution is a trade policy aimed at promoting domestic production. Minimum support prices are government interventions to protect farmers' incomes.  Production Linked Incentives are policies to boost domestic manufacturing.  Therefore, option (c) is the only correct answer as it includes all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more accurately matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sector                                     Characteristic
1. Primary Sector                              :   Includes agriculture, forestry, and fishing.
2. Secondary Sector                           :   Involves manufacturing, construction, and utilities.
3. Tertiary Sector                             :   Comprises services like trade, finance, and transportation.
4.  Formal Sector                              : Primarily characterized by high wages and better working conditions.
5. Informal Sector                             : Often characterized by low wages, lack of social security, and precarious employment.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The primary sector involves the extraction of raw materials; the secondary sector transforms these materials into finished goods; and the tertiary sector provides services.  The formal sector typically offers better employment conditions, while the informal sector is often characterized by low wages and limited worker protections.  Therefore, option (d), which includes all correctly matched pairs, is the correct answer. Other options are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Initiative                        Objective
1.  Import Substitution                     :   Reduce reliance on foreign goods and promote domestic industries.
2.  Liberalization                          :   Deregulation of the economy and increased private sector participation.
3.  Privatization                           :   Transfer of state-owned enterprises to the private sector.
4.  Globalization                           :   Increased integration of the Indian economy with the global economy.
5.  Inclusive Growth                         :   Ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared equitably across all segments of the population.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Each pair correctly links a policy or initiative with its primary objective. Import substitution aimed to reduce dependence on imports; liberalization sought to open up the economy; privatization involved transferring state-owned assets; globalization increased economic integration; and inclusive growth focuses on equitable distribution of benefits. Option (c) correctly identifies all these accurate matches. The other options are incorrect as they omit one or more of the correctly paired items.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sector                                    Employment Characteristic
1. Agriculture                               :   High proportion of self-employed workers.
2. Manufacturing                           :   Significant number of casual wage laborers.
3. Services                                 :   Increasing demand for skilled and specialized workers.
4. Formal Sector                            :   Relatively higher wages and better job security.
5. Informal Sector                           :   Predominantly characterized by low wages and irregular employment.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect employment characteristics across different sectors in the Indian economy. Agriculture is characterized by a high number of self-employed farmers.  Manufacturing often involves a significant portion of casual laborers. The services sector increasingly demands skilled workers. The formal sector offers better wages and job security compared to the informal sector, which is characterized by low wages and irregular employment.  Therefore, option (d) which correctly identifies all these matches, is the correct answer.  The other options are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy                      Year of Implementation/Announcement
1.  LPG Reforms                          :   1991
2.  Atmanirbhar Bharat Package         :   2020
3.  Upward revision of MSME definition :   2006
4.  Implementation of new MSME definition: 2022

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization (LPG) reforms were announced in 1991.  The Atmanirbhar Bharat package was announced in 2020. The upward revision of the MSME definition was announced in 2020, as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat package, and came into effect from July 1, 2020.  Option (d) is incorrect because the MSME Development Act was enacted in 2006, but the revision of its definition, not its initial implementation, was announced in 2020 and implemented in 2020. Option (a) and (b) are partially correct but incomplete.  Option (c) correctly identifies the accurate match for three pairs; the fourth pair is only partially correct, making option (c) the most comprehensive and accurate answer.


**2. With reference to the Indian Economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                     Description
1.  Inclusive Growth                     :   Focuses solely on income redistribution
2.  Pro-poor Growth (Absolute Definition):   Poor people benefit in absolute terms, irrespective of inequality changes.
3.  Pro-poor Growth (Relative Definition):   Incomes of poor grow faster than the overall population, reducing inequality.
4.  Seigniorage                          :   Profit from money creation, including inflation tax.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Inclusive growth aims for broad-based benefits and equal opportunities, not just income redistribution.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The definitions of pro-poor growth (absolute and relative) are accurately described in pairs 2 and 3. Seigniorage encompasses profit from money creation, including the inflation tax, making pair 4 correct. Option (c) accurately reflects the correct matching of pairs 2, 3, and 4. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise understanding of economic concepts.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                     Key Feature
1. PM-AASHA                             :   Focuses solely on price deficiency payments
2. PM-KISAN                             :   Provides income support linked to agricultural output.
3. Price Support Scheme (PSS)           :   Involves physical procurement of crops by private agencies.
4. Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS):  Direct payment of the difference between MSP and selling price.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PM-AASHA is an umbrella scheme encompassing price support, deficiency payments, and private procurement. Pair 1 is incorrect as it oversimplifies the scheme. PM-KISAN provides income support irrespective of agricultural output, making pair 2 incorrect.  PSS involves physical procurement by Central Nodal Agencies, not private agencies, making pair 3 incorrect.  PDPS, not PPSS, involves direct payment of the price difference, making pair 4 incorrect.  All pairs are incorrectly matched; hence, option (d) is the correct answer.  This question tests detailed knowledge of government schemes and their mechanisms.


**4. With reference to  Financial Institutions and Schemes, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Scheme         Characteristic
1.  Small Finance Banks (SFBs)         :   Primarily cater to large corporations.
2.  Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme    :   Covers only post-harvest expenses.
3.  Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana      :   Provides loans to poor farmers for specific crops.
4.  National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI): Launched RuPay, a card payment scheme.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Small Finance Banks target small businesses and marginal farmers, making pair 1 incorrect. KCC provides credit for various agricultural purposes, not just post-harvest expenses, making pair 2 incorrect. MUDRA Yojana aims at bringing small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system, not solely providing loans to farmers for specific crops, making pair 3 incorrect.  NPCI did indeed launch RuPay, making pair 4 correct. Only pair 4 is correctly matched; therefore, option (c) is correct. The question assesses knowledge of various financial schemes and institutions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                  Definition/Description
1.  Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)      :   Incentive given by a bank to a merchant for accepting debit card payments.
2.  Legal Tender Money                 :   Metallic money in circulation.
3.  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)       :   Decided by each individual bank.
4.  Money Multiplier                   :   Decreases with increased banking habit.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

MDR is a charge to merchants, not an incentive, making pair 1 incorrect. Legal tender is money a creditor must accept, not just metallic money, making pair 2 incorrect. CAR is set by regulatory authorities, not individual banks, making pair 3 incorrect.  The money multiplier increases with increased banking habits, making pair 4 incorrect.  All pairs are incorrectly matched, making option (d) correct.  This question tests understanding of financial terms and concepts.


**6. With reference to  Foreign Investments and Exchange Rates, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                 Effect/Characteristic
1.  Increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER):  Indicates depreciation of the rupee.
2.  Increase in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER): Improves trade competitiveness.
3.  Devaluation of a currency             : Necessarily increases the foreign value of domestic currency.
4.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)      : Investment through capital instruments in a listed company only.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

An increase in NEER indicates appreciation, not depreciation, of the rupee, making pair 1 incorrect. An increase in REER does not necessarily improve trade competitiveness, as it depends on other factors, making pair 2 incorrect. Devaluation improves export competitiveness but doesn't increase the foreign value of the domestic currency, making pair 3 incorrect. FDI can involve various investment methods, not just capital instruments in listed companies, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, all pairs are incorrectly matched, making option (d) correct.  This question tests understanding of exchange rate mechanisms and foreign investment characteristics.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                     Measurement/Characteristic
1.  Inflation                               :   Measured solely by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).
2.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)           :   Gives lower weight to food compared to WPI.
3.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates: Calculated by comparing prices of a basket of goods in different countries.
4.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)         :   Calculated only by the expenditure method.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Inflation is measured by both CPI and WPI, making pair 1 incorrect. CPI gives higher weight to food compared to WPI, making pair 2 incorrect. PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing prices of a similar basket of goods in different countries, making pair 3 correct. GDP is calculated by product, income, and expenditure methods, making pair 4 incorrect.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched, making option (b) correct. This question tests knowledge of economic indicators and their calculation methods.


**8. With reference to the Indian Financial System, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Concept                     Description
1.  IFSC (GIFT-SEZ)                       :   Treats transactions as domestic transactions.
2.  International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA):  Established before 2020.
3.  Strategic Disinvestment               :   Always involves a complete transfer of ownership.
4.  Balance of Payments (BoP)            :  Records only transactions related to goods.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

IFSC treats transactions as offshore, not domestic, making pair 1 incorrect. IFSCA was established in 2020, making pair 2 incorrect. Strategic disinvestment can involve partial ownership transfer, making pair 3 incorrect. BoP records transactions related to services and capital flows as well, making pair 4 incorrect. All pairs are incorrectly matched, making option (d) correct. This question tests understanding of the Indian financial system and its components.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Sector Initiative          Characteristic
1.  Operation Flood                       :   Failed to significantly increase milk production.
2.  Milk Cooperatives in Gujarat          :   Considered a model of inefficiency.
3.  Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLIS):  Incentives are not linked to incremental sales.
4.  Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs)         :   Primarily benefit large and medium farmers.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Operation Flood significantly increased milk production, making pair 1 incorrect.  Gujarat's milk cooperatives are a success story, making pair 2 incorrect. PLIS incentives *are* linked to incremental sales, making pair 3 incorrect. CHCs primarily benefit small and marginal farmers, making pair 4 incorrect.  All pairs are incorrectly matched, making option (d) correct. This question tests knowledge of agricultural initiatives and their impact.


**10. With reference to  Government Policies and Initiatives for MSMEs, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                       Feature
1.  Udyam Registration Number           :   Does not provide a unique identifier to MSMEs.
2.  Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance (RAMP): Does not address delayed payments.
3.  ASPIRE                                :   Focuses solely on urban entrepreneurship.
4.  CHAMPIONS                             :   Does not offer single-window solutions.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Udyam Registration provides a unique identifier, making pair 1 incorrect. RAMP specifically addresses delayed payments, making pair 2 incorrect. ASPIRE focuses on rural entrepreneurship, making pair 3 incorrect. CHAMPIONS provides single-window solutions, making pair 4 incorrect.  All pairs are incorrectly matched; thus, option (d) is correct. This question tests knowledge of government schemes aimed at promoting MSMEs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                  Description
1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :  Indicates a decrease in the value of the rupee
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     :  Reflects changes in a country's trade competitiveness
3. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)         :  Compares prices of goods and services across countries using a common currency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

Statement 2 accurately describes the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER).  The REER adjusts the nominal exchange rate for inflation differences between countries, providing a more accurate picture of a nation's competitiveness in international trade. An increase in the REER indicates a decrease in competitiveness, while a decrease suggests improved competitiveness.

Statement 3 correctly defines Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). PPP is a theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach. By comparing the cost of the same goods and services in different countries, PPP exchange rates are calculated to provide a more accurate comparison of economic output and living standards than nominal exchange rates.

Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in NEER indicates an *appreciation* of the rupee, meaning its value has increased relative to other currencies. A decrease in NEER would indicate a depreciation.  The question subtly tries to mislead the candidate by reversing the relationship.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                      Characteristic
1.  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)        :   Decided by each individual bank
2.  Money Multiplier                     :   Increases with higher banking habit of the population
3.  Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)       :   Interest and capital gains are tax-exempt

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only statement 2 is correctly matched.

Statement 2 accurately describes a key factor influencing the money multiplier. The money multiplier is the ratio of the money supply to the monetary base.  A higher banking habit (more people using banks) leads to a larger money multiplier effect because banks can lend out a greater proportion of their deposits, increasing the overall money supply.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is not decided by individual banks.  It is a regulatory requirement set by central banks (like the Reserve Bank of India) to ensure banks maintain sufficient capital to cover potential losses.  The level of CAR is a minimum percentage that banks must meet, and it's not individually decided.

Statement 3 is also incorrect. While inflation-indexed bonds offer protection against inflation, the interest received and capital gains are generally *taxable*, not tax-exempt. The tax treatment might vary depending on the specific country's regulations, but tax exemption is not a universal characteristic.


**3. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                       Primary Goal
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana           :   Providing loans to poor farmers
2. Kisan Credit Card Scheme              :   Short-term credit for post-harvest expenses
3. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana     :   Social protection and inclusion

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b). Only the second pair is correctly matched.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the Kisan Credit Card Scheme's primary goal.  The scheme provides short-term credit to farmers for various agricultural needs, including working capital, purchase of inputs, and post-harvest expenses.  It's a crucial part of India's agricultural credit system.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) is aimed at providing funding to micro and small businesses, not specifically poor farmers. While some farmers may benefit, the scheme's scope is broader.

Statement 3 is also incorrect.  While Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) aims to improve rural connectivity, which can indirectly contribute to social inclusion, its primary focus is on road infrastructure development, not directly on social protection and inclusion as a primary goal.  Social benefits are a consequence, not the central objective.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Economic Term                         Definition
1.  Seigniorage                               :   Profit from money creation
2.  Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)           :   Incentive for merchants accepting debit card payments
3.  Legal Tender Money                       :   Money a creditor is compelled to accept

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched.

Statement 1 correctly defines seigniorage. Seigniorage is the difference between the face value of money and the cost of producing it. Governments and central banks profit from this difference, which is a form of revenue generation without direct taxation.

Statement 3 accurately describes legal tender money. Legal tender is the currency that a creditor must accept as payment for debts.  This is a fundamental aspect of monetary systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is *not* an incentive; it is a *fee* charged to merchants by banks for processing debit card payments.  It's a cost for businesses, not an incentive.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Expenditure                     Example
1. Revenue Expenditure                     :   Acquisition of new technology
2. Capital Expenditure                     :   Interest payments on government debt
3.  Capital Budget Item                     :   Loans received from foreign governments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). Only statement 3 is correctly matched.

Statement 3 accurately describes a capital budget item.  Capital budgets account for government spending on long-term assets and investments. Loans from foreign governments represent an inflow of capital that increases the government's financial resources for such investments.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Acquiring new technology is considered *capital* expenditure because it increases the productive capacity of an organization or government.  It is a long-term investment, not a recurring operational cost.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Interest payments on government debt are classified as *revenue* expenditure.  These are recurring operational costs for servicing the debt, not investments in long-term assets.  They are part of the government's ongoing expenses.


**6. With reference to fiscal policy, consider the following pairs:**

   Fiscal Policy Tool                     Effect
1. Fiscal Stimulus                        :   Reduces aggregate demand
2.  Expansionary Monetary Policy        :   Increases money supply
3.  Tight Monetary Policy                 :   Increases interest rates

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). Only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the effect of expansionary monetary policy.  This policy involves actions like lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply to stimulate economic activity.  Increased money supply fuels spending and investment.

Statement 3 accurately describes a key effect of tight monetary policy.  This policy aims to curb inflation by reducing the money supply, often through increasing interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, thus reducing spending and investment.

Statement 1 is incorrect. A fiscal stimulus is designed to *increase* aggregate demand, not reduce it.  Stimulus packages usually involve increased government spending or tax cuts to boost economic activity.  A reduction in aggregate demand would typically be achieved through contractionary fiscal policy (reduced government spending or higher taxes).


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax Type                                 Example
1. Direct Tax                               :   Excise duty
2. Indirect Tax                             :   Corporate tax
3.  Tax Revenue Component                  :   Dividends on government investments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only statement 3 is correctly matched.

Statement 3 correctly identifies a component of tax revenue.  Dividends received by the government on its investments are a form of tax revenue, though not a direct tax collected through a tax system.  It's revenue generated from government holdings.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Excise duty is an *indirect* tax, levied on the manufacture or sale of goods within a country.  Direct taxes are levied on income or wealth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Corporate tax is a *direct* tax, levied on the profits of companies.  Indirect taxes are levied on goods and services.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Method of GDP Calculation              Description
1. Expenditure Method                       :   Sums all incomes received by factors of production
2. Income Method                            :   Sums all final expenditures in the economy
3.  Value Added Method                     :   Sums the value added at each stage of production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). Only statement 3 is correctly matched.

Statement 3 accurately describes the value-added method of calculating GDP.  This method sums up the value added at each stage of production in the economy, avoiding double counting of intermediate goods. It's a common approach to GDP calculation.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The expenditure method sums up all final expenditures in the economy (consumption, investment, government spending, net exports), not incomes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The income method sums up all incomes received by factors of production (wages, profits, rent, interest), not final expenditures.  Both statements 1 and 2 are reversed.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on economic concepts and their application within the Indian context, mirroring the style and difficulty level of UPSC questions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator                     | Description
---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) |  A weighted average of a country's currency value against a basket of currencies, reflecting changes in the nominal exchange rate.
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     | A weighted average of a country's currency value against a basket of currencies, adjusted for relative price levels.
3. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)       | A theory that states that exchange rates between currencies are in equilibrium when their purchasing power is the same in each of the two countries.
4. Consumer Price Index (CPI)           | A measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a basket of consumer goods and services.
5. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)           | A measure of the average change over time in the prices received by domestic producers for their output.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The NEER and REER are both weighted averages of a currency's value against other currencies, but the REER adjusts for inflation differences, making it a more accurate reflection of a country's competitiveness. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a widely used economic theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach. CPI and WPI are both price indices, but CPI focuses on consumer prices while WPI focuses on producer prices.  Understanding these key economic indicators is crucial for analyzing macroeconomic trends and policy decisions.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair, demonstrating an incomplete understanding of these crucial economic concepts.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept                     |  Associated Factor
---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
1. Demand-pull inflation                 | Expansionary monetary policies
2. Cost-push inflation                   | Rising input prices
3. Inflation-indexing wages              | Protection against inflation erosion of purchasing power
4. Capital formation                     | High capital-output ratio leading to decreased output
5.  V-shaped recovery                  | Rapid economic rebound following a sharp downturn


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand outpaces aggregate supply, often fueled by expansionary monetary policies. Cost-push inflation arises from increases in production costs (e.g., wages, raw materials). Inflation-indexing wages protects workers' purchasing power by adjusting wages to reflect inflation. A high capital-output ratio indicates that investment in capital goods does not translate efficiently into increased output, hindering economic growth. A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp decline followed by a swift and strong rebound.  Failing to match any of these pairs would indicate a lack of understanding of fundamental macroeconomic concepts and their real-world implications.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Financial Instrument                  |  Characteristic
---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
1.  Commercial Paper                    | Short-term unsecured promissory note
2. Certificate of Deposit (CD)         | Short-term debt instrument issued by banks
3. Call Money                            | Short-term interbank lending
4. Zero-coupon Bonds                   | Bonds that pay no periodic interest
5. External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) |  Loans raised by Indian entities from non-resident entities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Commercial paper is a short-term financing instrument, call money facilitates short-term interbank transactions, zero-coupon bonds don't pay periodic interest, and ECBs involve borrowing from non-resident entities.  Certificates of Deposit are short-term, not long-term, debt instruments issued by banks and other financial institutions.  The incorrect options demonstrate a lack of precise knowledge about financial instruments and their characteristics, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of financial markets and policy.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Institution/Policy                     |  Primary Objective
---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)          | Maintaining price stability and managing currency
2. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana          | Promoting financial inclusion among small businesses
3.  Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme     | Providing credit to farmers for various agricultural needs
4.  Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme         | Mobilizing domestic gold reserves
5. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)           | Catering to underserved segments of the population


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. The RBI's primary mandate includes price stability and currency management. MUDRA Yojana aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system. The KCC scheme provides credit for various farm-related expenses. Sovereign Gold Bonds aim to mobilize gold held by households.  Small Finance Banks (SFBs) target underserved customer segments.  Incorrect options would reveal a lack of awareness of key Indian financial institutions and policies, highlighting a gap in the understanding of India's economic development strategies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Term                          |  Definition
---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------
1. Seigniorage                           | Profit earned by the central bank from money creation
2. Money Multiplier                     | The amount by which an initial deposit in a bank can expand the money supply
3. Balance of Payments (BoP)           | A record of all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world
4. Real Exchange Rate                    | Nominal exchange rate adjusted for inflation
5. Import Cover                          | The amount of foreign exchange reserves relative to import value


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched.  Seigniorage represents the profit a central bank makes from issuing currency. The money multiplier shows how an initial deposit can expand the money supply through fractional reserve banking.  The balance of payments records all international transactions. The real exchange rate accounts for inflation differences between countries. Import cover is the ratio of foreign exchange reserves to import value.  Any option missing even one correct pairing reflects a superficial understanding of key macroeconomic terms and their definitions, essential for analyzing international trade and finance.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Scheme/Yojana                     Primary Aim
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana             :   Providing loans to poor farmers for cultivating specific crops
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme               :   Reducing India’s dependence on gold imports by promoting FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
3. Gold Monetization Scheme                 :   Bringing idle gold lying with Indian households into the formal financial system
4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme                 :   Construction of family houses and setting up village cold storage facilities for farmers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing loans.  Option 1 incorrectly links MUDRA Yojana to poor farmers. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme primarily aim to mobilize idle gold held by households, thereby reducing reliance on gold imports and boosting domestic economic activity. Option 2 incorrectly attributes FDI promotion as the primary aim of the Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme, while option 3 accurately describes the Gold Monetization Scheme's goal. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme offers short-term credit to farmers for various agricultural needs, including working capital, post-harvest expenses, and purchase of inputs.  Option 4 incorrectly lists the construction of family houses and cold storage facilities as primary purposes.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.


**2. With reference to financial instruments, consider the following pairs:**

   Instrument                                 Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                           :   A long-term instrument issued by the RBI to corporations
2. Certificate of Deposit                       :   A short-term unsecured promissory note
3. Call Money                                  :   Short-term finance used for interbank transactions
4. Zero Coupon Bonds                          :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks to corporations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by large corporations to raise short-term funds from the market.  Option 1 incorrectly describes it as a long-term RBI instrument. Certificates of Deposit are short-term debt instruments issued by banks to individuals and corporations. Option 2 incorrectly identifies it as an unsecured promissory note. Call money is indeed short-term finance primarily used for interbank transactions to manage liquidity. Option 3 is correctly matched. Zero-coupon bonds are debt instruments that do not pay periodic interest (coupons) but are sold at a discount and mature at their face value.  Option 4 incorrectly describes them as interest-bearing and issued by commercial banks. Thus, only statement 3 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Indian Banking system, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Entity                             Function/Characteristic
1. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :   Primarily responsible for regulating intellectual property rights in India.
2. RuPay                                        :   A card payment scheme launched by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion.
3. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)                   :   Primarily aimed at supplying credit to small business units and small and marginal farmers.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a crucial facilitator of financial inclusion in India through various payment systems like IMPS, UPI, etc. Option 1 incorrectly links NPCI to intellectual property rights regulation. RuPay is a domestic card payment network launched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), not the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion. Option 2 incorrectly attributes its launch to the wrong entity. Small Finance Banks (SFBs) are indeed designed to cater to the credit needs of small businesses, small and marginal farmers, and underserved sections of the population. Option 3 accurately reflects the primary purpose of SFBs.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Action                                    Economic Situation/Goal
1. Buying Government Securities              :   Addressing rapidly depreciating rupee.
2. Selling Dollars in the Market               :   Combating high inflation.
3. Following an expansionary monetary policy :   Stopping the slide of the Indian rupee.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RBI might buy government securities to inject liquidity into the market and stimulate economic activity, but this is not the primary response to a depreciating rupee.  Option 1 is incorrectly linked to rupee depreciation. Selling dollars in the foreign exchange market is a tool the RBI uses to manage the exchange rate and prevent excessive rupee depreciation, not to combat high inflation. Option 2 is incorrectly matched. An expansionary monetary policy, characterized by lower interest rates, is generally used to boost economic growth, not to stem the slide of a currency. Option 3 is incorrectly linked to rupee depreciation.  Therefore, only option (b) is correct as selling dollars is a direct response to a depreciating rupee.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                       Definition/Description
1. Legal Tender Money                         :   Metallic money in circulation in a country.
2. Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)              :   Incentive given by a bank to a merchant for accepting payments through debit cards.
3. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)               :   Amount decided by each individual bank to offset losses from non-repaying account holders.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Legal tender money refers to currency that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of a debt. Option 1 is correctly matched, although it simplifies the definition.  The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is the fee charged to merchants by banks for accepting payments through debit/credit cards. Option 2 incorrectly describes it as an incentive. The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is the minimum amount of capital a bank must maintain to cover potential losses.  This ratio is set by regulatory bodies, not individual banks. Option 3 incorrectly states that individual banks decide the CAR. Therefore, only statement 1 is correctly matched.


**6. With reference to international financial instruments, consider the following pairs:**

   Instrument                                    Characteristic
1. Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs) :   Included in Foreign Direct Investments (FDI).
2. Foreign Institutional Investment (FII)       :   Always involves debt-servicing.
3. Global Depository Receipts (GDRs)           :   A type of External Commercial Borrowing (ECB).
4. Non-Resident External Deposits (NRE Deposits) :   A method of raising finance through the secondary market.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs) are a form of external financing where bonds can be converted into equity, and are considered a component of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) if certain conditions are met. Option 1 is correctly matched. Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) which is a form of Foreign Portfolio Investment,  doesn't necessarily involve debt servicing; it primarily involves equity investments. Option 2 is incorrect. GDRs are not a type of ECB; they are a way for foreign investors to buy shares of a company listed on a foreign exchange. Option 3 is incorrect. NRE Deposits are deposits held by Non-Resident Indians, and are not a method of raising finance through the secondary market. Option 4 is incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following pairs:**

   BoP Account                                  Transaction Type
1. Current Account                             :   Records all international purchases and sales of assets.
2. Capital Account                             :   Records exports and imports of goods and services.
3. Official Reserve Transactions (ORT)       :   Represents the ultimate financing of any BoP deficit or surplus.
4. Errors and Omissions                        :   Reflects inaccuracies in recording international transactions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The current account records transactions in goods, services, and income, not asset purchases and sales. Option 1 is incorrect. The capital account records capital flows, which affect a country's foreign assets and liabilities; it does not record exports and imports of goods and services.  Option 2 is incorrect. Official Reserve Transactions are indeed the accommodating item in the BoP, representing the ultimate financing of deficits or surpluses.  Option 3 is correctly matched. Errors and omissions are the balancing item in the BoP, accounting for unrecorded transactions. Option 4 is correctly matched.  Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to international trade policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Trade Policy Instrument                      Purpose/Application
1. Anti-Dumping Duty                          :   Applied when a government gives subsidies to its exporters.
2. Safeguard Duty                              :   Applied when there is a surge in imports of a particular product, irrespective of the country of origin.
3. Countervailing Duty                         :   Used to rectify the situation arising from the dumping of goods at below-market prices.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Anti-dumping duty is imposed to counteract the effects of dumping (selling goods below market value), not government subsidies. Option 1 is incorrectly matched. Safeguard duty is a temporary measure taken to protect domestic industries from a surge in imports. Option 2 is correctly matched. Countervailing duty is applied to offset the effects of government subsidies given to foreign exporters. Option 3 is incorrectly matched.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.


**9. With reference to the IMF and World Bank, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution                                   Primary Function/Characteristic
1. International Monetary Fund (IMF)           :   Provides long-term loans of 25 to 30 years to developing countries.
2. World Bank                                   :   Assists member countries to overcome balance of payment problems.
3. Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)               :   A unit of account used by the World Bank for its lending operations.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IMF primarily focuses on international monetary cooperation, exchange rate stability, and providing short-term loans to address balance of payments issues. Option 1 is incorrectly matched. The World Bank's main objective is to promote economic development and poverty reduction through long-term loans and technical assistance. Option 2 is correctly matched. SDRs are the unit of account for the IMF, not the World Bank. Option 3 is incorrectly matched. Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.



**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Term                                   Description
1.  Amrit Kaal                                  :   A 75-year plan for India's development
2.  Plug and Play (in PM's interpretation)    :   Government controls production of major items
3.  Command and Control (in context of Indian Economy) :   Government provides infrastructure and policy support, leaving business setup to private entities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Amrit Kaal refers to the 25-year period leading up to India's 100th year of independence, focusing on achieving a developed India.  Option 1 incorrectly describes it as a 75-year plan. The "Plug and Play" concept, as interpreted by the Prime Minister, emphasizes ease of doing business by providing supportive infrastructure and reducing bureaucratic hurdles. Option 2 incorrectly links it to government control over production. The "Command and Control" approach in the Indian economy historically involved centralized planning and control over production and resource allocation. Option 3 correctly describes this approach. Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.


**1. With reference to India's foreign trade and economic openness, consider the following pairs:**

Year                     Percentage of Total Foreign Trade to GDP
1. 1985-86                : 38.9%
2. 2004-2005              : 16%
3.  2004-2005 (Imports)  : 17.1% of GDP
4. 2004-2005 (Exports)    : 11.8% of GDP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that in 2004-2005, imports constituted 17.1% and exports 11.8% of India's GDP.  Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the text indicates that the total foreign trade (exports + imports) as a proportion of GDP was 38.9% in 2004-2005, not 1985-86. Pair 2 is also incorrect; the total foreign trade percentage for 1985-86 was 16%, not 2004-2005.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between total trade and its components (imports and exports). The distractors are designed to confuse candidates by presenting figures that are close to, but not exactly, the correct values, testing their attention to detail.



**2. With reference to the international monetary system and currency convertibility, consider the following pairs:**

Concept                       Description
1.  Freely Convertible Currency  :  A currency that can be converted into gold at a fixed price.
2.  Currency Board Arrangement : A system where a country's currency is pegged to another currency.
3. Dollarization                 :  A system where a country abandons its domestic currency and adopts the US dollar.
4.  Fixed Exchange Rate          :  Exchange rates determined by market forces, with occasional central bank intervention.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The passage accurately describes a currency board arrangement (pair 2) as a system where a country's currency is pegged to another, often a major world currency.  Dollarization (pair 3) is also correctly defined as the adoption of another country's currency, eliminating the domestic one.  Pair 1 is incorrect; while freely convertible currencies were sometimes pegged to gold, the passage doesn't explicitly state this as the sole defining feature.  The definition of a fixed exchange rate (pair 4) is wrong; fixed exchange rates are not determined by market forces. The question tests understanding of different international monetary arrangements and their characteristics.  The inclusion of an incorrect definition of a fixed exchange rate and a partially correct definition of freely convertible currency serves as effective distractors.


**3. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following pairs:**

BoP Account Component       Description
1. Current Account           : Records only the import and export transactions of goods.
2. Trade Balance             :  The balance of exports and imports of goods and services.
3. Capital Account            : Records international purchases and sales of assets.
4. Invisible Trade             : Includes only non-factor income like tourism and shipping.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The text clearly defines the capital account (pair 3) as encompassing international transactions involving assets.  Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect.  The current account includes trade in goods and services, as well as transfer payments (not just goods as stated in pair 1). The trade balance (pair 2) is specifically the balance of goods, not goods and services. Invisible trade (pair 4) encompasses both factor and non-factor income. The question assesses understanding of the components of the BoP, testing recall and the ability to distinguish between related but distinct concepts.  The distractors use partially correct or closely related but inaccurate descriptions to increase the difficulty level.



**4. With reference to the concepts of autonomous and accommodating transactions in the BoP, consider the following pairs:**

Transaction Type          Description
1. Autonomous Transactions : Transactions determined by the net consequences of other BoP items.
2. Accommodating Transactions: Transactions made independently of the BoP's state.
3. Official Reserve Transactions:  A type of accommodating transaction.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The passage correctly identifies official reserve transactions (pair 3) as an accommodating item in the BoP.  Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect.  Autonomous transactions are independent of the BoP state, while accommodating transactions are those that adjust to the net effect of autonomous items. The question evaluates the understanding of the classification of international transactions within the BoP framework. The distractors are deliberately misleading, reversing the definitions of autonomous and accommodating transactions.


**5. With reference to the determination of income in an open economy, consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept              Equation/Description
1. National Income Identity (Open Economy): Y = C + I + G + X – M
2. Marginal Propensity to Import (m) : The fraction of an extra rupee of income spent on imports.
3. Open Economy Multiplier     : Always larger than the closed economy multiplier.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The text correctly presents the national income identity for an open economy (pair 1) and defines the marginal propensity to import (pair 2). Pair 3 is incorrect; the open economy multiplier is smaller than the closed economy multiplier because imports represent a leakage from the circular flow of income. The question tests the understanding of macroeconomic models in open economies. The distractor uses a statement that is the opposite of the correct relationship between open and closed economy multipliers.


**6.  With reference to the foreign exchange market and exchange rates, consider the following pairs:**

Exchange Rate Concept        Description
1. Nominal Exchange Rate     : The ratio of foreign to domestic prices, measured in the same currency.
2. Real Exchange Rate         : The price of one currency in terms of another.
3. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):  Exists when the real exchange rate is equal to one.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The text correctly defines the real exchange rate (pair 2) and purchasing power parity (pair 3). Pair 1 is incorrect; the nominal exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another, not the ratio of prices. The question tests the understanding of exchange rate concepts and their interrelationships.  The distractor presents a reversed definition of nominal and real exchange rates.


**7. With reference to the impact of foreign trade on aggregate demand, consider the following pairs:**

Impact of Foreign Trade      Effect on Aggregate Demand
1. Imports                     : Decreases aggregate demand.
2. Exports                     : Increases aggregate demand.
3. Trade Surplus (X > M)      : Decreases aggregate demand.
4. Trade Deficit (M > X)      : Increases aggregate demand.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Imports represent a leakage from the circular flow of income, reducing aggregate demand (pair 1). Exports inject spending into the economy, increasing aggregate demand (pair 2). Pairs 3 and 4 are incorrect; a trade surplus increases aggregate demand, and a trade deficit decreases it. The question assesses the understanding of how foreign trade affects macroeconomic variables. The distractors reverse the effects of trade surpluses and deficits on aggregate demand.


**8. With reference to the Balance of Payments (BoP) surplus and deficit, consider the following pairs:**

BoP Scenario                Financing Mechanism
1. Current Account Deficit   : Financed by net capital outflow.
2. Current Account Surplus   : Financed by net capital inflow.
3. Current Account Deficit   : Financed by running down foreign exchange reserves.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

A current account deficit (spending more abroad than receiving from sales) necessitates financing, often through selling assets or borrowing (pair 3). Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect; a current account deficit is financed by net capital *inflow*, and a current account surplus requires no external financing. The question evaluates understanding of the relationship between BoP accounts and the mechanisms for financing imbalances.  The distractors incorrectly link current account surpluses and deficits to capital flows in the opposite direction.


**9. With reference to the different monetary aggregates, consider the following pairs:**

Monetary Aggregate           Description
1. M1                          : Includes only currency and demand deposits.
2. M3                          : Also known as "aggregate monetary resources".
3. M4                          : Most liquid monetary aggregate.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

M1 is defined as currency plus demand deposits (pair 1). M3 is indeed commonly referred to as "aggregate monetary resources" (pair 2). Pair 3 is incorrect; M1 is the most liquid monetary aggregate, not M4.  The question assesses the understanding of different measures of money supply and their characteristics. The distractor uses a statement that is partially correct regarding the liquidity of monetary aggregates.


**10. With reference to the impact of demonetization on the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

Economic Variable          Effect of Demonetization
1. Liquidity (Effective Cash) : Increased significantly.
2. Liquidity (Bank Deposits) : Decreased significantly.
3. Money Supply             : Increased significantly.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) None

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrect. Demonetization led to a *decrease* in effective cash in circulation (pair 1). It led to an *increase* in bank deposits (pair 2), as people deposited old notes.  The effect on money supply was complex and debated, but it is unlikely to have led to a significant *increase* (pair 3).  The question tests understanding of the short-term impacts of demonetization on key macroeconomic variables. The distractors use statements that are opposite to the actual effects.


**11. With reference to money creation in a fractional reserve banking system, consider the following pairs:**

Concept                       Description/Value
1. Currency Deposit Ratio (cdr) : The ratio of reserves of banks to deposits of public in banks.
2. Reserve Deposit Ratio (rdr) : The ratio of currency held by the public to deposits of public in banks.
3. Money Multiplier           : Determined only by the currency-deposit ratio.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) None

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrect. The currency deposit ratio (cdr) is the ratio of currency held by the public to deposits (pair 1). The reserve deposit ratio (rdr) is the ratio of bank reserves to deposits (pair 2). The money multiplier is determined by both the cdr and rdr (pair 3).  The question tests understanding of the money creation process and the role of key ratios. The distractors reverse or partially misrepresent the definitions of the ratios and the money multiplier.


**12. With reference to the functions of money, consider the following pairs:**

Function of Money             Description
1. Medium of Exchange          :  Storing wealth for future use.
2. Unit of Account             : Expressing the value of goods and services in monetary units.
3. Store of Value              : Facilitating transactions.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched; the unit of account function of money allows for the expression of value in monetary terms. Pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect; the medium of exchange facilitates transactions, and the store of value function pertains to storing wealth. The question assesses the understanding of the fundamental functions of money in an economy. The distractors incorrectly associate functions with their descriptions.


**13. With reference to External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) and Masala Bonds, consider the following pairs:**

Financial Instrument            Characteristic
1. ECBs                         : Always denominated in Indian Rupees.
2. Masala Bonds                 : Issued outside India and denominated in Indian Rupees.
3. Masala Bonds                 : The currency risk is borne by the Indian borrower.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correct; Masala bonds are issued outside India but denominated in Indian Rupees.  Pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect; ECBs can be in foreign currency or Indian Rupees.  In Masala bonds, the currency risk is borne by the investor, not the borrower. The question assesses the understanding of international financial instruments. The distractors use partially correct or opposite statements to increase question difficulty.


**14. With reference to currency swaps and forex swaps, consider the following pairs:**

Swap Type                     Characteristic
1. Currency Swap (Companies) : Involves exchange of principal amounts in different currencies.
2. Currency Swap (Countries) : Always involves a fixed exchange rate.
3. Forex Swap                  : Involves only the Central Bank of India.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Currency swaps between companies (pair 1) indeed involve exchanging principal amounts in different currencies. Currency swaps between countries (pair 2) frequently involve pre-agreed or fixed exchange rates. Pair 3 is incorrect; forex swaps can involve other entities besides the Central Bank of India.  The question tests knowledge of different types of swaps and their features. The distractor uses a statement that is only partially true about forex swaps.


**15. With reference to the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in GIFT City, consider the following pairs:**

IFSC Characteristic              Description
1. Location                       : Only in GIFT City, Gujarat.
2. Transaction Currency          : Only Indian Rupees.
3. Permitted Entities             : Banking, Insurance, and Capital Markets related companies.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The IFSC in GIFT City is indeed unique in India (pair 1).  The permitted entities are those related to banking, insurance, and capital markets (pair 3). Pair 2 is incorrect; transactions can be in any currency except the Indian Rupee. The question assesses understanding of the IFSC concept and its features. The distractor uses a statement that is the opposite of the reality for IFSC transaction currency.


**16. With reference to the impact of inflation on economic behavior, consider the following pairs:**

Inflation Type                   Economic Effect
1. Low Inflation                 : People are less willing to lend money at low nominal interest rates.
2. Galloping Inflation          : People are willing to sign long-term contracts in money terms.
3. Hyperinflation                : Relative prices become highly unstable.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correct; hyperinflation is characterized by highly unstable relative prices. Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect; low inflation encourages saving and long-term contracts, while galloping inflation discourages lending at low nominal rates and long-term contracts. The question tests understanding of the effects of different inflation levels on economic behavior. The distractors reverse the effects of low and galloping inflation on economic behavior.


**17. With reference to the concepts of deflation and disinflation, consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept              Description
1. Deflation                    : A general increase in prices.
2. Disinflation                 : A slowing down in the rate of inflation.
3. Deflation                    :  Increases unemployment.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Disinflation is accurately described (pair 2). Deflation, being a decrease in prices, does lead to increased unemployment (pair 3). Pair 1 is incorrect; deflation is a decrease, not an increase, in prices. The question tests understanding of deflation and disinflation. The distractor incorrectly defines deflation as an increase in prices.


**18. With reference to India’s exchange rate policy, consider the following pairs:**

Period/System              Characteristic
1. Post-independence to 1975: Rupee pegged to the pound sterling.
2. 1975-1992                  : Rupee pegged to a weighted basket of currencies.
3. Post-1993                  : Rupee's exchange rate is completely fixed by RBI.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The text correctly describes the rupee's peg to the pound sterling (pair 1) and its subsequent peg to a basket of currencies (pair 2). Pair 3 is incorrect; the rupee's exchange rate is market-determined, with RBI intervention for orderly conditions, not completely fixed. The question tests knowledge of the evolution of India's exchange rate policy. The distractor presents a false statement about the post-1993 exchange rate regime.


**19. With reference to the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS), consider the following pairs:**

LRS Feature                     Description
1. Annual Limit                  :  $250,000 per financial year.
2. Permitted Transactions       : Only current account transactions.
3. Aim                           : To completely free up all capital controls in India.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correct; the LRS annual limit is $250,000. Pairs 2 and 3 are incorrect; the LRS permits both current and capital account transactions. The aim of LRS is not to completely free up capital controls but to gradually liberalize them. The question tests understanding of the LRS and its limitations. The distractors present partially correct or opposite statements about the scheme's features and goals.


**20. With reference to the liquidity trap, consider the following pairs:**

Economic Condition              Description
1. Liquidity Trap                : Nominal interest rates are near zero.
2. Liquidity Trap                : Central banks can easily stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates.
3. Liquidity Trap                : People prefer to hold cash rather than invest.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

A liquidity trap is characterized by near-zero nominal interest rates (pair 1).  In a liquidity trap, individuals hoard cash due to low interest rates and weak economic expectations (pair 3). Pair 2 is incorrect; in a liquidity trap, further interest rate cuts are ineffective in stimulating the economy. The question assesses understanding of the liquidity trap phenomenon. The distractor presents a statement opposite to the effectiveness of monetary policy in a liquidity trap.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question focuses on factual recall, analysis, and application of knowledge related to Indian economics and governance.  The difficulty level is aimed at being challenging, requiring precise knowledge and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**1. With reference to the Indian economy's openness, consider the following pairs:**

    Year                     Percentage of Foreign Trade to GDP
    1. 1985-86                :   38.9%
    2. 2004-2005              :   16%
    3. Post-2004-2005         :   Above 50% in several countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement in pair 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that in 1985-86, the total foreign trade (exports + imports) as a proportion of GDP was 16 percent. Pair 1 incorrectly reverses the figures for 1985-86 and 2004-2005. Pair 3 is accurate in stating that many countries exhibit foreign trade proportions exceeding 50% of their GDP, a fact used for comparison with India's relatively lower openness.  The question tests the ability to recall precise numerical data and understand the concept of economic openness.  The incorrect options provide plausible distractors by interchanging or misrepresenting the percentage figures.



**2. With reference to the components of India's Balance of Payments (BoP), consider the following pairs:**

    Account                     Transaction Type
    1. Current Account          :   International purchases and sales of assets
    2. Capital Account           :   Exports and imports of goods and services
    3. Capital Account           :   Remittances, gifts, and grants
    4. Current Account          :   Foreign investments (FDI and FPI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The current account encompasses exports and imports of goods and services, as well as transfer payments (remittances, gifts, and grants). The capital account records international purchases and sales of assets.  The question tests the understanding of the fundamental distinction between the current and capital accounts in the BoP.  The incorrect options deliberately confuse the components of each account to create plausible but incorrect pairings.



**3. With reference to the determination of exchange rates, consider the following pairs:**

    Term                         Definition
    1. Nominal Exchange Rate    :   Ratio of foreign to domestic prices
    2. Real Exchange Rate       :   Amount of domestic currency to buy one unit of foreign currency
    3. Purchasing Power Parity  :   Goods cost the same in two countries when measured in the same currency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) refers to the situation where goods cost the same in different countries when measured in a common currency.  Pair 1 incorrectly defines the nominal exchange rate as the ratio of prices, while it is actually the price of one currency in terms of another. Pair 2 incorrectly assigns the definition of the real exchange rate to the nominal exchange rate. This question tests the understanding of key economic terms related to exchange rates and their precise definitions.  The distractors are carefully designed to confuse similar but distinct concepts.



**4. With reference to the Foreign Exchange Market, consider the following pairs:**

    Participant                     Role
    1. Commercial Banks           :   Regulate foreign exchange transactions
    2. Foreign Exchange Brokers   :   Facilitate trading between participants
    3. Monetary Authorities        :   Determine exchange rates directly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 is correctly matched. Foreign exchange brokers are intermediaries who facilitate trading among market participants. Pair 1 is partially correct; commercial banks are major participants, but they do not regulate transactions – that's the role of monetary authorities. Pair 3 is incorrect; monetary authorities influence exchange rates through policy, but markets primarily determine them. The question assesses the understanding of the roles of different entities in the foreign exchange market. The incorrect options include plausible but inaccurate descriptions of participants' roles.



**5. With reference to India's foreign investment, consider the following pairs:**

    Investment Type                 Characteristic
    1. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) :   Investment less than 10% of equity in a listed company
    2. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI):   Investment of 10% or more in a listed company
    3. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI):   Investment in government securities
    4. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)  :   Involves active management participation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. FDI typically involves active management participation by the foreign investor.  Pair 1 incorrectly describes FDI as being less than 10% equity; it's 10% or more. Pair 2 incorrectly states that FPI is 10% or more in a listed company; it is less than 10%. Pair 3 is partially correct, as FPI can include investments in government securities, but this is not its sole defining characteristic. The question tests the understanding of the key distinctions between FDI and FPI.  The distractors are designed to confuse the thresholds and characteristics of each investment type.


**6.  With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s functions, consider the following pairs:**

    Function                         Activity
    1. Banker to the Government    :   Managing and servicing government securities
    2.  Debt Manager               :  Lending at the repo rate to banks
    3.  Maintaining Foreign Exchange Reserves: Investing in US government bonds
    4. Money Creation             :   Seigniorage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The RBI manages government securities, invests foreign currency assets (FCA) including US government bonds, and generates seigniorage through money creation. Pair 2 is incorrect; while the RBI lends at the repo rate, this is a monetary policy function, not directly part of its role as a debt manager.  The question assesses knowledge of the RBI's multifaceted roles within the Indian financial system. The distractors subtly alter the descriptions of functions to create plausible but ultimately incorrect pairings.


**7. With reference to the concepts of inclusive growth, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                       Description
    1. Inclusive Growth            :   Focuses solely on income redistribution
    2.  Capability Attribute        :   Concentrates on providing the means for people to enhance capabilities
    3. Access Attribute            :   Focuses on bringing opportunities and capabilities together
    4. Opportunity Attribute        :   Generating more opportunities to increase income


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The capability attribute focuses on empowering individuals, the access attribute on connecting them to opportunities, and the opportunity attribute focuses on income generation. Pair 1 is incorrect; inclusive growth is not solely about income redistribution but also about creating opportunities and capabilities. The question assesses understanding of the key elements of inclusive growth. The distractors misrepresent the core principles of inclusive growth to create plausible but incorrect associations.


**8. With reference to  India's economic reforms post-1991, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Area                   Reform Measure
    1. Industrial Sector           :  Continued dominance of industrial licensing
    2. Financial Sector            :    Establishment of private sector banks
    3. Tax Reforms                 :   Substantial increase in income tax rates
    4. Foreign Exchange Market   :   Rupee devaluation in 1991


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The post-1991 reforms saw the establishment of private sector banks and the devaluation of the rupee. Pair 1 is incorrect; industrial licensing was significantly reduced. Pair 3 is incorrect; income tax rates were generally reduced to encourage compliance. The question tests the knowledge of specific policy changes during India's economic liberalization. The incorrect options present plausible but inaccurate reform measures.



**9.  With reference to different economic indicators, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                      Characteristic
    1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   Indicates improvement in trade competitiveness
    2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     :   Reflects changes in the value of currency based on inflation
    3. Consumer Price Index (CPI)              :    Gives higher weightage to food compared to WPI
    4. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)             :   Captures changes in service prices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The REER reflects currency value adjusted for inflation, and the CPI gives higher weight to food than the WPI. Pair 1 is incorrect; NEER doesn't directly indicate trade competitiveness, the REER does. Pair 4 is incorrect; CPI, not WPI, captures service prices. The question tests the knowledge of different economic indicators and their specific features. The distractors confuse indicators with similar but different characteristics.


**10. With reference to  fiscal policy in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Measure                  Impact
    1.  Reduction in export subsidy  :   Increased current account deficit
    2.  Devaluation of domestic currency :   Improved competitiveness of exports
    3.  Attracting greater FDI        :   Reduced current account deficit
    4. Fiscal Stimulus               :   Boosting economic activity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Devaluation makes exports more competitive, attracting FDI improves the current account, and fiscal stimulus aims to boost economic activity. Pair 1 is incorrect; reducing export subsidies would likely worsen the current account deficit by making exports less competitive. The question assesses the understanding of fiscal policy tools and their impacts on the economy. The distractors offer plausible but incorrect consequences of policy measures.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of IPR                                   Governing Act/Provision
    1. Trade Secrets                               :   TRIPS Agreement
    2. Geographical Indications (GI)              :   Design Act 2000
    3. Industrial Designs                          :   Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999
    4. Patents (product patents for drugs)       :   Patents Act, 1970 (amended in 2005)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Trade secrets are indeed protected under the TRIPS agreement, which sets minimum standards for IPR protection among WTO members.  The Patents Act, 1970, specifically its 2005 amendment, introduced product patents for drugs, a significant change from the previous process-patent-only system.  However, options 2 and 3 are incorrect. Geographical Indications are governed by the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999, not the Design Act 2000.  Industrial designs fall under the purview of the Design Act 2000, not the Geographical Indications Act.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options include incorrect pairings, demonstrating a need for precise understanding of Indian IPR legislation.


**2. With reference to the Indian economy's macroeconomic indicators, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                      Characteristic/Effect
    1. Increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER):   Indicates a depreciation of the Rupee
    2. Increase in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)      :   Indicates an improvement in trade competitiveness
    3. High Capital-Output Ratio                       :   Leads to significant increase in output despite high savings
    4. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates     :   Calculated by comparing prices of a different basket of goods in different countries

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

An increase in the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) does indeed suggest an improvement in a country's trade competitiveness, as its goods become relatively cheaper compared to those of other nations.  However, the other statements are incorrect. An increase in NEER indicates appreciation, not depreciation, of the domestic currency. A high capital-output ratio signifies inefficiency, meaning that a large capital investment yields relatively little output; it does not lead to a significant increase in output despite high savings. Finally, PPP exchange rates are calculated by comparing prices of the *same* basket of goods and services in different countries to account for differences in purchasing power.  Only pair 2 is accurate, highlighting the importance of understanding the nuances of macroeconomic indicators.


**3. With reference to financial instruments and institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Instrument/Institution                            Description
    1.  Compulsory License (under Indian Patent Act 1970) :   Granted only after negotiation between patent owner and manufacturer fails
    2.  Small Finance Banks (SFBs)                     :   Primarily focus on providing credit to large corporations
    3.  Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)                   :   Incentive given by the government to merchants for accepting digital payments
    4.  Legal Tender Money                             :   Money a creditor is not compelled to accept in settlement of claims

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

A compulsory license, as per the Indian Patent Act 1970, is granted *only* after negotiations for a voluntary license between the patent holder and a manufacturer have failed.  The other options contain inaccuracies. Small Finance Banks (SFBs) are designed to cater to small businesses, farmers, and micro-entrepreneurs, not large corporations. The Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) is a *charge*, not an incentive, levied on merchants by banks for accepting card payments. Finally, legal tender money is, by definition, money that a creditor *is* legally obligated to accept.  Only pair 1 accurately reflects the relevant information.


**4.  With reference to India's agricultural policies and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Policy                                     Key Feature
    1. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)      :   Covers only pre-harvest losses
    2. Soil Health Card Scheme                         :   Aims to expand cultivable area under irrigation
    3. National Agriculture Market (NAM) Scheme      :   Provides farmers access to only local markets
    4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme                        :   Provides long-term credit support for farm asset purchase only


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) None
    (b) 1 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) None

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. PMFBY covers both pre and post-harvest losses. The Soil Health Card Scheme focuses on improving soil health and fertilizer management, not irrigation expansion. NAM aims to provide farmers with access to a nationwide market. Kisan Credit Card Scheme offers short-term credit for various agricultural needs, including working capital and post-harvest expenses, not solely long-term credit for asset purchases.  This question highlights the importance of understanding the precise details of various government schemes and their objectives.


**5. With reference to India's foreign trade and balance of payments, consider the following pairs:**

    Account/Concept                            Definition/Characteristic
    1.  Current Account Balance                  :   Includes only trade in goods (visible trade)
    2.  Autonomous Transactions in BoP           :   Made independently of the state of the BoP
    3.  Capital Account in BoP                    :   Records only foreign direct investment (FDI) flows
    4.  Real Exchange Rate                        :   Ratio of domestic to foreign prices measured in the same currency


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Autonomous transactions in the balance of payments are indeed made independently of the overall balance of payments situation, driven by factors like profit motives. The other statements are incorrect. The current account balance includes visible and invisible trade, as well as transfer payments and investment income. The capital account includes various capital flows beyond FDI, such as foreign portfolio investment (FPI) and loans. The real exchange rate is the ratio of foreign to domestic prices, not the other way around.  Only pair 2 accurately describes the concept.


**6. With reference to  India's financial sector reforms and institutions, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Concept                            Location/Function
    1. IFSC (GIFT-SEZ)                            :   Allows only onshore transactions
    2. India International Exchange (India INX)     :   Operates from GIFT City, Gandhinagar, Gujarat
    3. International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA):  Regulates only banking activities in IFSCs
    4.  Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) :  Not involved in strategic disinvestment


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The India International Exchange (India INX) is indeed located at GIFT City, Gandhinagar, Gujarat.  The other statements are not completely accurate. IFSC (GIFT-SEZ) specifically allows offshore transactions. IFSCA regulates a broader range of financial products and services in IFSCs, not just banking. DIPAM is the nodal department for strategic disinvestment.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of key institutions and their roles in India's financial landscape.


Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of macroeconomic concepts, international trade, and the Indian economy.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                   Description
    1.  Balance of Payments (BoP)           :  Records only transactions in goods between residents and the rest of the world.
    2.  Current Account                         :  Includes trade in services but excludes transfer payments.
    3.  Capital Account                         :  Records international purchases and sales of assets like stocks and bonds.
    4.  Autonomous Transactions              :  Transactions made independently of the BoP's state, like those driven by profit motives.
    5.  Accommodating Transactions           : Determined by the net consequences of autonomous items, such as official reserve transactions.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because pairs 2, 3, and 5 accurately reflect the definitions and functions within the balance of payments framework.  The current account encompasses trade in both goods (visible) and services (invisible) along with transfer payments. The capital account indeed involves the buying and selling of assets across international borders.  Accommodating transactions are those undertaken to adjust imbalances created by autonomous transactions, with official reserve transactions being a prime example.


Pair 1 is incorrect as the BoP records transactions in goods, services, and assets. Pair 4 is correctly matched; however, it is not the only correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Term                         Definition/Characteristic
    1.  Real Exchange Rate                  :  The ratio of domestic to foreign prices, measured in the same currency.
    2.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)       :  Goods cost the same in two countries when measured in different currencies.
    3.  Nominal Exchange Rate                :  The price of one currency in terms of another, quoted in money terms.
    4.  Bilateral Nominal Exchange Rate     :  Exchange rates for multiple currencies against a single currency.
    5.  Managed Float Exchange Rate System :  Central bank never intervenes in foreign exchange markets.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) Only 3
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) correctly matches three pairs. The real exchange rate accurately reflects the relative price of goods between countries. The nominal exchange rate correctly defines the price of one currency in terms of another, and is quoted in money terms. The bilateral nominal exchange rate correctly describes the exchange rate between two currencies.

Pair 2 is incorrect; PPP implies goods cost the same in different countries when measured in the *same* currency. Pair 5 is incorrect; a managed float system involves central bank intervention to manage currency volatility.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Policy/Measure                 Impact on the Indian Economy
    1.  Devaluation of the Rupee             :  Necessarily increases the foreign value of the domestic currency.
    2.  Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) :  Allows unlimited remittance of funds overseas by resident individuals.
    3.  Currency Board Arrangement           :  Allows a country to expand its money supply at will.
    4.  Dollarization                           :  Gives a country complete control over its money supply.
    5.  Expansionary Monetary Policy         :  Likely to reduce demand-pull inflation.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only 2
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. Devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper, but doesn't increase the foreign value of its currency. The LRS has a limit of $250,000 per year. A currency board limits money supply expansion, not enables it. Dollarization relinquishes control over the money supply to the dollar-issuing authority. Expansionary monetary policy is likely to *increase*, not reduce, demand-pull inflation.


**4.  With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Instrument                        Characteristic
    1.  Commercial Paper                       :  A long-term secured promissory note issued by corporations.
    2.  Certificate of Deposit (CD)              :  A short-term instrument issued by scheduled commercial banks to corporations.
    3.  Call Money                               :  Short-term finance used for interbank transactions.
    4.  Zero-coupon Bonds                       :  Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by the Reserve Bank of India.
    5. Inflation-Indexed Bonds (IIBs)          : Do not provide protection to investors from uncertainty regarding inflation.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. Call money is indeed short-term interbank finance.  IIBs *do* protect investors from inflation risk; this is their primary purpose.  Commercial paper is short-term and unsecured, CDs are short-term, and zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest.


**5. With reference to India's foreign trade and economic policies, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy/Agreement                         Outcome/Characteristic
    1.  Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)         :  Always lead to a trade surplus for India with partner countries.
    2.  Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP): India is currently a member.
    3.  Anti-Dumping Duty                       :  A WTO-compliant measure to counteract unfairly low-priced imports.
    4.  Countervailing Duty                     :  Imposed on imports from countries that provide subsidies to their exporters.
    5.  WTO Agreements                         :  Guarantee equal market access for all member countries without exception.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) Only 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Anti-dumping and countervailing duties are indeed WTO-compliant measures to address unfair trade practices.

Pair 1 is incorrect as FTAs don't guarantee trade surpluses. Pair 2 is incorrect because India withdrew from RCEP. Pair 5 is incorrect as WTO agreements aim for fair trade but don't guarantee equal market access in all cases due to various factors and existing trade imbalances.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                     Description
1.  Commercial Paper                     :   A long-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations
2.  Certificate of Deposit                 :   A short-term instrument issued by commercial banks to corporations
3.  Call Money                             :   Short-term finance used for interbank transactions
4.  Zero Coupon Bonds                    :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks to corporations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair relating to "Call Money" and its description is correctly matched. Call money is indeed a short-term finance instrument used primarily for interbank transactions to manage short-term liquidity needs.  The other options contain inaccuracies. Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note, not long-term. Certificates of deposit are short-term borrowing instruments issued by banks, not by corporations. Zero-coupon bonds are not interest-bearing during their life; instead they are issued at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturity.  The incorrect pairings highlight common misconceptions about financial instruments and the importance of precise definitions in understanding financial markets.  Understanding the nuances of these instruments is crucial for analyzing monetary policy and financial stability.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Policy Instrument           Effect on Indian Rupee
1. Curbing imports of non-essential goods :   Easing conditions relating to external commercial borrowing
2. Encouraging Indian borrowers to issue rupee-denominated Masala Bonds :   Following an expansionary monetary policy
3. Easing conditions relating to external commercial borrowing :   Stopping the slide of Indian Rupee
4. Following an expansionary monetary policy :   Increasing the slide of Indian Rupee

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair linking an expansionary monetary policy with an increase in the slide of the Indian Rupee is correctly matched. An expansionary monetary policy involves increasing the money supply, which can lead to inflation and depreciation of the currency. The other options present incorrect relationships. Curbing non-essential imports might help the rupee, but it is not directly linked to external commercial borrowing.  Encouraging Masala Bonds, while potentially beneficial in the long run, does not immediately stop a rupee slide. Easing external commercial borrowing conditions can increase the supply of foreign currency, potentially supporting the rupee, rather than causing its slide. These incorrect pairings illustrate the complexities of exchange rate management and the multiple factors that influence a currency's value.  Understanding these intricate relationships is key to evaluating economic policy effectiveness.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Measure to Reduce Currency Crisis Risk    Description
1. Foreign currency earnings of India's IT sector :   Increasing government expenditure
2. Increasing government expenditure          :   Increasing the risk of currency crisis
3. Remittances from Indians abroad           :   Reducing the risk of currency crisis


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair correctly matching remittances from Indians abroad with a reduction in currency crisis risk is accurate. Remittances provide a substantial inflow of foreign exchange, bolstering foreign exchange reserves and improving a country's ability to withstand external shocks.  The other pairings are incorrect.  Foreign currency earnings from the IT sector do contribute positively but are not directly related to increasing government expenditure.  Increasing government expenditure, especially if not matched by revenue increases, can contribute to inflation and potentially weaken the currency, increasing the risk of a currency crisis. The mismatched pairs highlight the importance of considering multiple factors, including the balance of payments and fiscal policy, when assessing a country's vulnerability to currency crises.  Understanding these dynamics is essential for formulating sound macroeconomic policies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Purpose of Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme/Gold Monetization Scheme   Description
1. To bring idle gold lying with Indian households into the economy   :   To promote FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
2. To promote FDI in the gold and jewellery sector                     :   To reduce India’s dependence on gold imports
3. To reduce India’s dependence on gold imports                       :   To bring idle gold lying with Indian households into the economy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair linking the schemes to bringing idle household gold into the economy is correctly matched. Both schemes aim to mobilize gold held by households, increasing the country's gold reserves and reducing reliance on imports. The other pairs are incorrect. While the schemes might indirectly influence FDI and reduce import dependence, their primary and direct objective is not to specifically promote FDI or directly control import levels.  The incorrect pairings underscore the importance of distinguishing between primary and secondary objectives of government policies.  Understanding the core goals of such initiatives is crucial for evaluating their effectiveness in achieving broader economic objectives.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                     Meaning
1.  Merchant Discount Rate                  :   The amount banks pay back to customers using debit cards
2.  Legal Tender Money                      :   Metallic money in circulation in a country
3.  Money Multiplier                       :   Increases with an increase in the cash reserve ratio


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the definition of legal tender money is correctly stated. Legal tender money refers to currency that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of debts.  The other definitions are inaccurate. The merchant discount rate is the fee a merchant pays to a bank for accepting card payments. The money multiplier is inversely related to the cash reserve ratio; a higher CRR leads to a lower money multiplier.  The incorrect pairings emphasize the need for precise definitions in economics, particularly when discussing monetary policy and financial transactions.  Accurate understanding of these terms is crucial for analyzing financial systems and their regulation.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution                                 Function
1.  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) :   Provides short-term, conditional loans for policy reforms only
2.  International Monetary Fund (IMF)        :   Provides long-term loans for both policy reforms and projects
3.  International Development Association (IDA) :   Provides interest-free loans and grants to the world's poorest countries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the description of the International Development Association (IDA) is accurate. IDA specifically focuses on providing concessional financing (interest-free loans and grants) to the world's poorest countries for poverty reduction and development. The other pairings are incorrect. IBRD provides long-term loans, not short-term loans, and its lending extends to both policy reforms and specific projects. The IMF primarily focuses on short-term loans to address balance of payments issues and policy reforms, and not long-term project financing. These incorrect pairings illustrate the distinct roles and functions of various international financial institutions, highlighting the importance of understanding their mandates and operational mechanisms.  This understanding is crucial for analyzing global financial architecture and development cooperation.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Tax                                     Example
1. Direct Tax                                     :   Value Added Tax (VAT)
2. Indirect Tax                                   :   Income Tax
3.  Direct Tax                                    :   Goods and Services Tax (GST)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair correctly classifying GST as a direct tax is accurate.  In the Indian context, GST is a consumption tax levied at each stage of production and distribution, making it an indirect tax.  The other pairings are incorrect. Income tax is a direct tax levied on income earned by individuals and corporations. VAT is also an indirect tax levied on the value added at each stage of production and distribution.  The incorrect pairings highlight the importance of understanding the distinction between direct and indirect taxes, a fundamental concept in public finance.  This understanding is crucial for analyzing fiscal policies and their impact on various segments of the economy.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Inflation Type                             Cause
1. Demand-pull inflation                     :   Rising Interest Rates
2. Cost-push inflation                       :   Expansionary Policies
3. Stagflation                               :   Fiscal Stimulus

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair correctly linking cost-push inflation with expansionary policies is accurate. Expansionary fiscal policies, by increasing government spending or reducing taxes, can increase aggregate demand and lead to cost-push inflation.  The other pairings are incorrect. Demand-pull inflation is caused by excess demand exceeding supply, not rising interest rates. Rising interest rates usually combat inflation. Stagflation is characterized by slow economic growth and high unemployment alongside high inflation, and is not directly caused by fiscal stimulus. The mismatched pairs highlight the different causes of inflation and the complexities of macroeconomic policy. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for formulating effective monetary and fiscal policies.



**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index                                      Characteristic
1. Consumer Price Index (CPI)                 :   Lower weightage of food compared to Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
2. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)              :   Captures changes in the prices of services
3.  Reserve Bank of India's Key Inflation Measure :   Currently, the Consumer Price Index (CPI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair correctly identifying the RBI's key inflation measure as the CPI is accurate. The RBI primarily uses the CPI to assess inflation and guide monetary policy decisions.  The other pairings are incorrect. CPI has a higher weightage of food compared to WPI. WPI does not capture changes in service prices; CPI does.  The incorrect pairings illustrate the differences between various price indices and their implications for macroeconomic policy.  Understanding these differences is crucial for interpreting inflation data and formulating effective policy responses.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                     Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana             :   Providing loans to poor farmers for cultivating specific crops
2. Kisan Credit Card Scheme                 :   Short-term credit support for consumption needs of farm households
3. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana        :   Providing pension to old and destitute persons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing accurately describing the Kisan Credit Card scheme's objective is correct.  The Kisan Credit Card scheme indeed provides short-term credit to farmers for various agricultural purposes, including meeting consumption needs of farm households. The other pairings are incorrect.  The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system, not specifically providing loans to poor farmers. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana focuses on rural road infrastructure, not pension provision. The incorrect pairings showcase the need for precise understanding of government schemes and their specific objectives.  This understanding is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of social and economic policies.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

    Fiscal Policy Instrument             Effect
1. Fiscal Stimulus                      :   Reduces economic activity
2. Tax Reduction                        :   Always increases tax revenue
3. Increased Government Expenditure :   Can lead to increased inflation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing accurately linking increased government expenditure with the potential for increased inflation is correct. Increased government spending can fuel demand and lead to inflationary pressures if not managed effectively.  The other pairings are incorrect. Fiscal stimulus aims to boost economic activity, not reduce it. Tax reduction does not always increase tax revenue; it can sometimes decrease revenue due to lower tax rates. The incorrect pairings highlight the complex interplay between fiscal policy instruments and their potential effects on the economy.  Understanding these dynamics is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of fiscal policies.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Term                            Definition
1.  Real Exchange Rate                       :   Rupee price of foreign exchange
2.  Nominal Exchange Rate                   :   Ratio of foreign to domestic prices
3.  Purchasing Power Parity                  :   Goods cost the same in two countries when measured in the same currency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the definition of Purchasing Power Parity is correctly matched. Purchasing power parity refers to the concept where the same goods cost the same in different countries when expressed in a common currency. The other definitions are incorrect.  The real exchange rate adjusts the nominal exchange rate for price differences between countries. The nominal exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another. The incorrect pairings illustrate the importance of understanding the distinctions between various economic terms related to exchange rates and international trade. This understanding is vital for analyzing international economic relations and formulating trade policies.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Indicator                       Impact of Devaluation
1.  Trade Balance                           :   Always improves
2.  Competitiveness of Domestic Exports    :   Always improves
3.  Foreign Value of Domestic Currency      :   Increases


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing correctly linking devaluation with improved competitiveness of domestic exports is accurate. Devaluation makes exports cheaper for foreign buyers, thereby boosting their competitiveness. The other pairings are incorrect. Devaluation does not always improve the trade balance; it depends on the price elasticity of demand for imports and exports.  Devaluation decreases the foreign value of the domestic currency.  The incorrect pairings highlight the complexities of devaluation and its impact on various economic indicators.  Understanding these complexities is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of exchange rate policies.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                    Description
1.  Seigniorage                               :   Profit from money creation
2.  Money's Function as a Medium of Exchange:   Storing wealth for future use
3.  Money's Function as a Store of Value    :   Facilitating transactions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the definition of seigniorage is correctly matched. Seigniorage refers to the profit a government or central bank earns from issuing currency. The other definitions are incorrect.  Money's function as a medium of exchange facilitates transactions. Money's function as a store of value allows for storing wealth for the future. The incorrect pairings highlight the importance of precise definitions in economics, particularly when discussing monetary policy and the functions of money.  Understanding these concepts is crucial for analyzing monetary systems and their impact on the economy.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution                                  Funding Source
1.  International Development Association (IDA) :   Primarily from contributions of member governments
2.  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD):   Primarily from issuance of bonds in international financial markets
3.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) :   Primarily from quotas subscribed by member countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The pairings correctly describing the funding sources for IDA and IBRD are accurate. IDA is primarily funded by contributions from member countries, while IBRD raises most of its funds from international capital markets. The pairing for AIIB is incorrect; AIIB also raises funds from subscribed capital by member countries and other sources. The incorrect pairing for AIIB highlights the diverse funding mechanisms of multilateral development banks.  Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for analyzing their financial sustainability and their ability to meet their development objectives.


**16. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Concept                             Description
1.  Capital Formation                            :   Always results in significant output increase in a high-saving economy
2.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Exchange Rates :   Calculated by comparing prices of different baskets of goods and services
3.  Potential GDP                                :   Unaffected by industrial and agricultural output


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the description of Purchasing Power Parity exchange rates is correct. PPP exchange rates compare the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries to determine real exchange rates.  The other descriptions are incorrect.  Capital formation does not always result in a significant output increase, especially if the capital-output ratio is high or there are other bottlenecks. Potential GDP is directly impacted by the performance of industrial and agricultural outputs. The incorrect pairings highlight the complexities of macroeconomic indicators and their relationships.  Understanding these relationships is crucial for interpreting economic data and formulating sound economic policies.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator                     Description
1. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :  A decrease indicates the depreciation of the rupee.
2. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)     : An increase indicates improved trade competitiveness.
3. Consumer Price Index (CPI)             :  Gives less weightage to food compared to the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A rise in NEER signifies that the domestic currency has appreciated against a basket of other currencies.  Conversely, a fall indicates depreciation. Thus, statement 1 is correctly matched.  An increase in REER reflects an improvement in a country's trade competitiveness because its goods and services are becoming relatively cheaper compared to those of its trading partners, after adjusting for inflation. This makes its exports more attractive and imports less competitive. Hence, statement 2 is correctly matched.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The CPI gives higher weightage to food compared to the WPI, reflecting the greater importance of food in household consumption in India.  The WPI focuses on wholesale prices and may not fully capture changes in the prices of services, which the CPI does. This difference in weightage and scope is crucial for understanding inflation dynamics and policymaking.  The other options are incorrect because they either include the false statement 3 or exclude the true statements 1 and 2.


**2. With reference to macroeconomic indicators, consider the following pairs:**

Indicator                                  Characteristic
1. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) exchange rates : Calculated by comparing prices of a basket of goods in different countries.
2. Wholesale Price Index (WPI)                : Captures changes in services prices comprehensively.
3. Capital formation in a high-saving economy  : Always results in a significant increase in output.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PPP exchange rates are indeed calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries to account for differences in purchasing power. This makes statement 1 correct. Statement 2 is incorrect; the WPI primarily focuses on wholesale prices of goods and does not capture changes in service prices comprehensively. The CPI provides a more inclusive measure of inflation, incorporating service prices and household consumption patterns. Statement 3 is false. High savings do not guarantee increased output; it also depends on factors like the capital-output ratio, efficiency of capital allocation, and the overall investment climate. A high capital-output ratio means that a large amount of investment is needed to generate a unit of output, potentially reducing the impact of increased capital formation on output.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include false statements 2 and/or 3.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Concept                         Correct Description
1.  Market demand for a good               : Increases if the price of its complement increases.
2.  Demand-pull inflation                  : Can be caused by expansionary policies and fiscal stimulus.
3.  Legal tender money                     : Bank money in the form of checks, drafts, and bills of exchange.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Market demand for a good increases if the price of its substitute increases (consumers switch to the relatively cheaper good) or if the price of the good itself falls (increased affordability). If the price of a complement increases, demand for the original good will likely decrease as consumers buy less of the complement. Statement 2 is correct. Demand-pull inflation arises when aggregate demand outpaces aggregate supply, leading to rising prices. Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies can stimulate demand, potentially leading to this type of inflation. Statement 3 is incorrect. Legal tender money refers to currency (notes and coins) that a creditor is legally obligated to accept in settlement of debts.  Checks, drafts, and bills of exchange are not legal tender; their acceptance depends on trust and creditworthiness. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one false statement.


**4. With reference to financial instruments and policies, consider the following pairs:**

Instrument/Policy                           Description
1.  Commercial Paper                        : A long-term unsecured promissory note.
2.  Certificate of Deposit                    : A short-term instrument issued by scheduled commercial banks to corporations.
3.  Kisan Credit Card Scheme                : Provides short-term credit for constructing family houses and setting up cold storage facilities.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note issued by corporations to raise short-term funds. Statement 2 is correct.  Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are short-term debt instruments issued by banks to individuals and corporations.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Kisan Credit Card scheme provides short-term credit for agricultural purposes, including working capital, purchase of inputs, and post-harvest expenses. It does not cover non-agricultural investments like house construction or cold storage facilities. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include false statements 1 and/or 3.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Financial Term                                  Correct Definition
1. Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)                : The amount paid back by banks to customers using debit cards.
2.  Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)               : The amount banks maintain as their own funds to offset losses from non-repayment of dues by account holders.
3. Masala Bonds                                  : Bonds issued outside India, denominated in the local currency of the issuing country.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MDR is the fee charged by banks to merchants for accepting payments through debit cards. It's not a payment back to customers. Statement 2 accurately describes the CAR. Banks are required to maintain a certain level of capital as a buffer against potential losses. Statement 3 is incorrect. Masala bonds are rupee-denominated bonds issued outside India. They are not denominated in the local currency of the issuing country. They are denominated in Indian Rupees, not the currency of the country where they are issued.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one false statement.


**6. With reference to international financial institutions, consider the following pairs:**

Institution                                   Primary Function
1. International Monetary Fund (IMF)          : Primarily lends for specific development projects.
2. World Bank                                 :  Its main source of funds is quota subscriptions from member countries.
3. Reserve Tranche Position (RTP)            :  A portion of a country's quota in the IMF that is immediately repayable.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMF primarily focuses on maintaining international monetary cooperation, exchange rate stability, and assisting countries facing balance of payments problems. It doesn't primarily lend for specific projects like the World Bank.  Statement 2 is correct. The World Bank's main funding source is indeed quota subscriptions from member countries, supplemented by bond issuances.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The RTP is a portion of a member country's IMF quota that it can use at its discretion without immediate repayment obligations. The other options are incorrect because they include false statements 1 and/or 3.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Financial Instrument/Mechanism            Feature
1.  External Commercial Borrowing (ECB)     : Always denominated in foreign currency.
2.  Currency Swap Agreement (between countries):  Involves pre-agreed exchange rates for the entire swap period.
3.  Forex Swap Agreement (with RBI)          : RBI always buys dollars first and then repurchases them later.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ECBs can be raised in either foreign currency or Indian rupees. Statement 2 is correct. Currency swap agreements between countries typically involve pre-agreed exchange rates, reducing exchange rate risk for the participating central banks. Statement 3 is incorrect. In a forex swap, the RBI can either buy or sell dollars initially, depending on the market conditions and the objective of the transaction. The direction of the transaction (buying or selling dollars first) is flexible.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include false statements 1 and/or 3.


**8. With reference to the Indian economy and international trade, consider the following pairs:**

Concept/Policy                                 Description
1.  Free Trade Agreement (FTA)                   : Members maintain the same tariffs for trade with non-members.
2.  Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP): India's withdrawal was primarily due to concerns about dumping of agricultural products.
3.  Countervailing Duty                          :  Applied when there is a surge in imports of a particular product from any country.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. In an FTA, members reduce tariffs among themselves, but maintain their own tariffs for trade with non-members.  Statement 2 is correct.  India's withdrawal from RCEP was largely driven by concerns about increased competition, especially from China, and the potential for dumping of goods, particularly agricultural products, in the Indian market.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Safeguard duty, not countervailing duty, is applied when there's a surge in imports, regardless of the source country. Countervailing duty is specifically levied to offset subsidies provided by exporting countries. Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of false statements 1 and/or 3.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

     Trade Agreement Type              | Defining Characteristic
    ------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
    1. Free Trade Agreement (FTA)       | Members apply a common external tariff (CET) to imports from non-members.
    2. Customs Union (CU)             | Members reduce tariffs among themselves, maintaining their own tariffs with non-members.
    3. Common Market (CM)            |  Member countries coordinate macroeconomic and exchange rate policies.
    4. Economic Union (EU)            | Movement of factors of production is relatively free among member countries.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is correctly defined in option 2.  Members of an FTA reduce tariffs on trade with each other but maintain their individual tariffs for trade with non-members.  A Customs Union (CU) goes a step further by adding a common external tariff (CET) on imports from non-member countries. Option 1 incorrectly matches FTA with the defining characteristic of a Customs Union.  A Common Market (CM) adds the free movement of factors of production (labor, capital) to a customs union, while an Economic Union (EU) integrates macroeconomic policies and exchange rate policies, making option 3 and option 4 correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because only option 2 is correctly matched. Option (c) is incorrect because only option 4 is correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, consider the following pairs:**

     Agreement                          | Key Principle/Feature
    ------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
    1. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 |  Focuses primarily on trade in services.
    2. General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)      |  Deals with trade in goods, including tariff reduction.
    3. Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) | Protects intellectual creations like inventions and designs.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GATT 1994 (updated under the Uruguay Round) primarily deals with trade in goods, not services.  GATS, on the other hand, specifically addresses trade in services.  TRIPS correctly focuses on intellectual property rights. Option 1 incorrectly pairs GATT with trade in services; GATS is the agreement that focuses on services. Option 2 is also incorrect because it incorrectly attributes goods trade to GATS. Option (d) is also incorrect as only option 3 is correctly matched.  Therefore, only option 3 is correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

     WTO-compliant Trade Protection Measure | Description
    ------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
    1. Anti-Dumping Duty                | Imposed when a country provides subsidies to its exporters.
    2. Countervailing Duty               | Applied when there's a surge in imports of a specific product regardless of origin.
    3. Safeguard Duty                    | Levied when goods are exported at a price lower than their domestic price.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Safeguard duty is correctly defined as a temporary measure to protect a domestic industry from a surge in imports. Anti-dumping duty is imposed to counteract dumping (exporting goods below their domestic price), and countervailing duty addresses government subsidies to exporters. Option 1 incorrectly describes countervailing duty as the measure associated with subsidies; it is anti-dumping duty. Option 2 incorrectly defines safeguard duty; it is not concerned with the origin of the imports. Option (a) is incorrect as only option 3 is correct. Option (b) is also incorrect as only option 3 is correct. Option (d) is incorrect as option 3 is correctly matched.



**4. With reference to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution          | Primary Objective/Function
    ---------------------|--------------------------------
    1. IMF                | Provides long-term loans for development projects.
    2. World Bank        | Monitors global financial stability.
    3. World Bank         | Aims to promote international monetary cooperation.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The IMF's primary focus is on international monetary cooperation and assisting countries with balance of payments problems, typically through short-term loans. The World Bank primarily provides long-term loans and development assistance for projects.  Monitoring global financial stability is a key function of the IMF, not the World Bank. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

     Concept Related to Inclusive Growth | Description
    ------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
    1. Opportunity                     | Protecting individuals from livelihood loss.
    2. Capability                      | Providing access to resources and markets.
    3. Access                          | Enhancing skills and abilities to utilize opportunities.
    4. Security                        | Creating more income-generating opportunities.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Opportunity in inclusive growth focuses on creating more income-generating opportunities, as stated in Option 4. Security, on the other hand, centers around protecting individuals from temporary or permanent loss of livelihood.  Capability and access are incorrectly paired in options 2 and 3. Capability refers to enhancing skills and abilities, while access focuses on providing access to resources and markets. Options (b), (c) and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**6. With reference to India's energy sector, consider the following pairs:**

     Policy/Initiative                     |  Objective/Feature
    ------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
    1. Electricity Act of 2003           |  Mandates complete elimination of cross-subsidies.
    2. Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) |  Impose obligations on entities to purchase only renewable energy certificates (RECs).
    3.  Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) |  Certify ownership of electricity generated from renewable sources.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Electricity Act of 2003 aims for the progressive reduction and elimination of cross-subsidies, not complete elimination immediately.  RPOs allow for the purchase of either RECs or direct renewable power, not exclusively RECs. RECs correctly certify the ownership of renewable energy generated. Option 1 incorrectly states that the Electricity Act mandates complete elimination of cross-subsidies. Option 2 incorrectly states that RPOs mandate the purchase of only RECs.  Therefore, only pair 3 is fully correct.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on Polity and Governance aspects implicitly present within the economic discussions.  Note that some economic concepts are used to frame questions about governance structures and policies.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Area                       Policy Outcome
1.  Import Substitution Policy       :   Increased domestic production
2.  Fertilizer Subsidy Reduction    :   Higher cost of agricultural production
3.  Disinvestment of PSUs          :   Increased government revenue
4.  Tax Incentives for Foreign Investors:   Curtailed government revenue

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Import substitution policies, aimed at replacing imports with domestic goods, indeed lead to increased domestic production. This is a direct consequence of protectionist measures shielding domestic industries from foreign competition.  The reduction in fertilizer subsidies directly increases the cost of agricultural production for farmers, particularly small and marginal farmers who rely heavily on these subsidies.

Option 3 is incorrect because while disinvestment aims to increase government revenue, the effectiveness depends on various factors, including the valuation of PSUs and the utilization of funds.  The text indicates apprehensions about undervaluation and inefficient use of proceeds. Option 4 is incorrect as the text explicitly states that tax incentives for foreign investors, while attracting investment, reduce the government's ability to raise tax revenues.  This is a trade-off between attracting foreign investment and domestic revenue generation.  The government's fiscal policy choices thus demonstrate a complex interplay between economic growth and revenue collection.



**2. With reference to India's economic reforms, consider the following pairs:**

   Reform Measure                   Intended Goal
1.  Rupee Devaluation               :   Increase foreign exchange inflow
2.  Removal of Quantitative Restrictions on Imports:  Boost domestic manufacturing efficiency
3.  Abolition of Industrial Licensing :   Promote competition and reduce bureaucratic hurdles

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Devaluation of the rupee makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, leading to an increase in foreign exchange inflow as exports become more competitive in the international market.  The text clearly indicates that this was an immediate measure to address the balance of payments crisis.  The abolition of industrial licensing aimed at promoting a more competitive environment by reducing bureaucratic hurdles and increasing ease of doing business.  This directly addresses the inefficiencies stemming from excessive regulations.

Option 2 is incorrect because while removing import restrictions could indirectly benefit domestic manufacturing, the text suggests that it can also lead to increased competition and challenges for domestic industries, particularly in agriculture.  The removal of quantitative restrictions on imports, while intended to increase international competitiveness, was a double-edged sword, impacting domestic firms. The success of this policy depends on the ability of domestic industries to compete effectively.



**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy                    Major Criticism
1.  Import Substitution Policy        :   Reduced efficiency and competitiveness
2.  Export-Oriented Policy in Agriculture:   Pressure on food grain prices
3.  Disinvestment of PSUs           :   Undervaluation of PSU assets

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Import substitution policies, by shielding domestic industries from competition, often lead to reduced efficiency and a lack of competitiveness in the global market.  This is a well-documented criticism of such protectionist strategies. The shift towards an export-oriented policy in agriculture, focusing on cash crops, can indeed put pressure on food grain prices as resources are diverted from food production to export-oriented crops. This raises concerns about food security, particularly in a developing country context.  The disinvestment of PSUs has faced criticism due to concerns about the undervaluation of assets during the sale to the private sector, leading to potential losses for the government.

All three pairs represent valid criticisms of specific economic policies adopted during the reform period.  The criticisms highlight the trade-offs and unintended consequences of policy choices, underscoring the complexity of economic governance.



**4. With reference to India's participation in international trade agreements, consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement                                   Major Concern for India
1.  Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP):   Trade deficit with member countries
2.  World Trade Organization (WTO)           :   Inadequate dispute resolution mechanisms
3.  Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)              :   Increased imports compared to exports


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

India's primary concern regarding RCEP was the potential for increased trade deficits due to its existing trade imbalances with many member countries.  Opening markets further under RCEP was feared to exacerbate this issue.  The text highlights concerns about the WTO's dispute settlement system's efficacy, including issues with the Appellate Tribunal and increasing protectionism by members.  India's experience with FTAs, as noted in the text, shows that increased trade has often tilted towards increased imports rather than exports.

This demonstrates India's strategic approach in navigating global trade agreements, balancing the benefits of increased trade with the potential risks to its domestic industries and economy.  The concerns highlighted demonstrate a need for careful consideration of the policy implications of international trade agreements on a developing economy.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                      Interpretation
1.  Increase in Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER):  Appreciation of the Rupee
2.  Increase in Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER):   Improvement in trade competitiveness
3.  Increasing divergence between NEER and REER:      Increasing domestic inflation relative to other countries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

An increase in NEER indicates that the domestic currency has appreciated relative to a basket of other currencies.  This is a straightforward interpretation of the NEER.  An increasing divergence between NEER and REER is indeed a consequence of increasing domestic inflation relative to inflation in other countries.  This is because REER takes into account inflation differentials, while NEER does not.

Option 2 is incorrect. An increase in REER indicates a *decline* in trade competitiveness, not an improvement.  A higher REER means domestic goods become relatively more expensive compared to foreign goods, making exports less competitive.  The interplay between NEER and REER demonstrates the need for a nuanced understanding of exchange rate dynamics beyond simple nominal values.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                     Definition/Description
1.  Balance of Payments (BoP)      :     Records transactions in goods, services, and assets between residents and the rest of the world.
2.  Current Account                   :     Includes exports and imports of goods and services, and transfer payments.
3.  Capital Account                   :     Records international purchases and sales of assets like money, stocks, and bonds.
4.  Trade Balance                     :    The difference between exports and imports of goods only.
5.  Autonomous Transactions       :     International transactions made independently of the BoP state (e.g., profit motive).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched based on standard economic definitions.  The Balance of Payments (BoP) is a comprehensive record of all economic transactions between a country's residents and the rest of the world. This includes the Current Account, which tracks trade in goods and services (visible and invisible trade) and transfers; and the Capital Account, which records flows of capital – investments, loans, etc. The Trade Balance is a subset of the Current Account, focusing solely on the difference between exports and imports of goods. Finally, Autonomous Transactions are those undertaken independently of the overall Balance of Payments position, driven by factors like profit maximization rather than BoP balancing needs.  Therefore, all five pairs accurately reflect established economic concepts. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                  Illustrative Example
1.  Nominal Exchange Rate           :     The rupee price of one US dollar.
2.  Real Exchange Rate               :     Ratio of foreign to domestic prices, measured in the same currency.
3.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)    :      Goods cost the same in two countries when measured in the same currency.
4.  Devaluation                      :     A government-decreed reduction in the value of a currency.
5.  Depreciation                     :    A market-driven decrease in the value of a currency.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately represent standard economic definitions. The nominal exchange rate is simply the price of one currency in terms of another (e.g., rupees per dollar).  The real exchange rate adjusts the nominal exchange rate for price differences between countries, indicating the relative purchasing power of currencies. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theoretical concept suggesting that exchange rates should adjust to equalize the prices of identical goods and services in different countries. Devaluation is an official action by a government to lower its currency's value, while depreciation is a market-driven decline in value.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Investment                 Characteristic
1.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) :    Acquisition of existing mills overseas.
2.  Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI):   Purchase of bonds or stocks issued by an overseas company.
3.  Foreign Institutional Investment (FII):  Investment in a wholly-owned business firm overseas.
4.  Overseas Direct Investment (ODI): Investment made by an Indian resident in an IFSC entity.
5.  Net Capital Inflow               :     Financing a current account deficit by selling assets or borrowing abroad.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The first two pairs are classic definitions of FDI and FPI. FDI involves direct control or ownership in a foreign entity, while FPI is a passive investment in foreign securities.  Pair 4 correctly identifies ODI, as explained in the text.  Pair 5 is accurate: a current account deficit (spending more abroad than receiving from sales) is financed by a net capital inflow. Option 3 is incorrect because creating a wholly-owned business overseas is a form of FDI, not FII, which usually refers to institutional investors like mutual funds.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete, neglecting to include some of the correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization        Primary Focus
1.  World Trade Organization (WTO) :    Solving trade disputes among member nations.
2.  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC): Control over petroleum prices.
3.  International Monetary Fund (IMF): Providing assistance for poverty alleviation to the world's poorest countries.
4.  International Development Association (IDA):  Administering all multilateral trade agreements.
5.  World Bank                       : Establishing a rule-based trading regime.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The WTO's core function is to regulate international trade and resolve disputes. OPEC's primary aim is to manage oil production and prices. Option 3 is incorrect; the IDA, a World Bank affiliate, focuses on poverty alleviation.  Option 4 is incorrect; the WTO, not the IDA, administers trade agreements. Option 5 is incorrect;  the WTO, not the World Bank, aims to establish a rule-based trading regime. Thus, only pairs 1 and 2 accurately reflect the primary focus of the respective organizations.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy/Measure       Impact on Indian Economy
1.  Removal of Export Duties      :     Increased the competitive position of Indian goods internationally.
2.  Removal of Quantitative Restrictions on Imports:  Led to increased competition from cheaper imports.
3.  Reduction in Import Duties    :   Adversely affected Indian farmers due to increased international competition.
4.  Fertilizer Subsidy Removal     :   Increased the cost of production for small and marginal farmers.
5.  Disinvestment of PSUs       :   Generated revenue to offset government revenue shortages.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The removal of export duties aimed to boost Indian exports' competitiveness.  Removing quantitative restrictions on imports increased competition, potentially benefiting consumers but also harming some domestic industries. The removal of fertilizer subsidies directly increased costs for farmers.  Disinvestment generated revenue for the government. Option 3 is incorrect because while the reduction in import duties can increase competition, the passage specifically links the adverse impact on farmers to other policy changes, not simply import duty reductions.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incomplete.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Indicator               Description/Measurement
1.  Gross Domestic Product (GDP)   :   Total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders.
2.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)     :   Measures changes in the prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households.
3.  Wholesale Price Index (WPI)    :   Measures changes in the prices of goods at the wholesale level.
4.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER):  Weighted average of a currency's value against other currencies.
5.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER):  Adjusts NEER for inflation differences between countries.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. GDP measures the total output of an economy. CPI and WPI are standard inflation indices measuring price changes at the consumer and wholesale levels, respectively. NEER reflects a currency's value relative to a basket of other currencies, while REER further adjusts for inflation differentials.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude some of the correctly matched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Growth Strategy/Policy          Objective/Outcome
1.  Import Substitution Industrialisation:  Protecting domestic industries from foreign competition.
2.  Export-Oriented Industrialisation:  Focusing on producing goods for export markets.
3.  Liberalization                     :   Reducing government control and increasing market forces.
4.  Privatization                     :   Transferring ownership of state-owned enterprises to the private sector.
5.  Globalization                     :   Increasing integration of national economies with the global economy.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Import substitution industrialisation aims to protect domestic industries by limiting imports. Export-oriented industrialisation focuses on exporting goods to generate foreign exchange and growth. Liberalization reduces government intervention, allowing markets to operate more freely. Privatization shifts ownership from the public to the private sector. Globalization involves the increasing interconnectedness of national economies. Therefore, all five pairs accurately describe the objectives or outcomes of these economic policies. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Economic Reform Measure     Associated Challenge
1.  Removal of Quantitative Restrictions: Increased competition from cheaper imports.
2.  Reduction in Import Duties        :   Potential for dumping of goods from other countries.
3.  Disinvestment of PSUs           :   Concerns about undervaluation of assets.
4.  Tax Reductions                   :   Reduced government revenue.
5.  Fertilizer Subsidy Removal       :  Increased cost of production for farmers.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Removing quantitative restrictions on imports increased competition from cheaper goods. Reducing import duties carries the risk of dumping (selling goods below cost). Disinvestment of PSUs raised concerns about the sale price. Tax reductions decreased government revenue. Removing fertilizer subsidies increased costs for farmers. Therefore, all five pairs correctly identify challenges associated with specific Indian economic reform measures. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incomplete, excluding correctly matched pairs.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Indian Economic Reform Outcome       Associated Issue
1.  High GDP Growth Rate             :    Inequitable distribution of benefits.
2.  Increased Foreign Investment      :   Concerns about loss of national sovereignty.
3.  Increased Foreign Exchange Reserves:   May not reflect overall economic well-being.
4.  Growth in Service Sector          :   Job creation in other sectors lagging.
5.  Rising Prices                     :   Erosion of purchasing power.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

High GDP growth has not always translated into equal distribution of wealth. Increased foreign investment has raised concerns about potential loss of control over national policies. High foreign exchange reserves do not guarantee overall prosperity. The service sector's growth has not been matched by adequate job creation in other sectors. Rising prices reduce the purchasing power of money. Therefore, all five pairs correctly link an economic outcome with a related issue. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incomplete, excluding some of the correctly matched pairs.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

     International Agreement/Institution   Feature/Outcome
1.  WTO Agreements                     :   Removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers.
2.  Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) :   Preferential arrangements among members.
3.  Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)     :   Reduction of tariffs on trade among members.
4.  India-UAE CEPA                    :   Zero duty access to 90% of India’s exports to UAE.
5.  India-Australia ECTA               :   Preferential market access for India on 100% of Australia’s tariff lines.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

WTO agreements aim to reduce trade barriers globally. RTAs create preferential trade arrangements within a region. FTAs reduce tariffs among participating countries. The India-UAE CEPA and the India-Australia ECTA are specific examples of FTAs with the stated outcomes. Therefore, all five pairs accurately reflect features or outcomes of these international agreements or institutions.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Yojana                     Focus/Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana     :   Providing pension to old and destitute persons
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme      :   To promote FDI in the gold and jewellery sector
3. Gold Monetization Scheme         :   To reduce India’s dependence on gold imports
4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme        :   Construction of family houses and setting up village cold storage facilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency Ltd.) aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system by providing loans.  Option 1 is incorrect. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme are designed to bring idle gold lying with households into the economy and reduce India's reliance on gold imports. Option 2 is incorrect; FDI promotion is not their primary objective. Option 3 is correct. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme provides short-term credit support to farmers for working capital, purchase of inputs, and post-harvest expenses, but not for construction of houses or cold storage facilities, making option 4 incorrect. Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar government schemes.  The distractors are plausible because all the schemes relate to financial inclusion or rural development in some way.


**2. With reference to financial instruments in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Instrument                         Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                  :   A long-term instrument issued by the RBI to a corporation
2. Certificate of Deposit              :   A short-term unsecured promissory note
3. Call money                          :   Short-term finance used for interbank transactions
4. Zero coupon Bonds                  :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks to corporations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Commercial Paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by large corporations to raise short-term funds from the market, making statement 1 incorrect.  Certificates of Deposit are short-term debt instruments issued by banks, not the RBI, and are not unsecured promissory notes. Statement 2 is incorrect. Call money is indeed short-term finance primarily used for interbank transactions, making statement 3 correct. Zero-coupon bonds are debt instruments that do not pay periodic interest but are sold at a discount and mature at face value; they are not short-term and not necessarily issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The question assesses factual knowledge of financial instruments and tests the ability to identify correct characteristics. Distractors utilize close but incorrect details, making simple recall insufficient.


**3. With reference to the Indian banking system, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                     Function/Characteristic
1. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :   Manages and services State Government Securities
2. Small Finance Banks (SFBs)               :   Primarily focused on supplying credit to large corporations
3. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                :   Appointed by the State Governments
4. Urban Cooperative Banks                  :   Supervised and regulated by local boards set up by the State Governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NPCI promotes financial inclusion and launched RuPay, but it does not manage State Government Securities; that's a function of the RBI.  Statement 1 is incorrect. SFBs are designed to provide credit to small businesses, small and marginal farmers, and to encourage entrepreneurship, not large corporations. Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI Governor is appointed by the Central Government, not State Governments. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Urban Cooperative Banks were brought under the Banking Regulation Act, they are not solely supervised by local boards set up by State Governments; the RBI also plays a role. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the Indian financial system and highlights the complexities of regulatory oversight. All distractors represent common misconceptions about the roles and functions of these entities.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                      Meaning/Reference
1. Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)           :   Incentive given by the government to merchants for promoting digital payments
2. Legal Tender Money                     :   Bank money in the form of cheques, drafts, bills of exchange
3. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)           :   Decided by each individual bank
4. Money Multiplier                       :   Increases with an increase in the cash reserve ratio

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

MDR is the charge a bank levies on a merchant for accepting card payments, not a government incentive. Statement 1 is incorrect. Legal tender money is the currency that a creditor is legally obligated to accept for settling debts, not just bank money. Statement 2 is incorrect. CAR is a regulatory requirement set by the RBI, not individual banks. Statement 3 is incorrect. The money multiplier is inversely related to the cash reserve ratio; an increase in the latter decreases the former. Statement 4 is incorrect. This question demands precise understanding of economic terms and their application. All options are designed with subtle inaccuracies to test the candidate's grasp of these concepts.


**5. With reference to measures to mitigate currency crises in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Measure                                     Effect
1. Foreign currency earnings of India's IT sector :   Increases the risk of a currency crisis
2. Increasing government expenditure         :   Reduces the risk of a currency crisis
3. Remittances from Indians abroad             :   Reduces the risk of a currency crisis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency earnings from the IT sector bolster India's foreign exchange reserves, reducing vulnerability to currency crises.  Statement 1 is incorrect. Increasing government expenditure can worsen a country's fiscal position, potentially increasing the risk of a currency crisis. Statement 2 is incorrect. Remittances from Indians abroad directly increase foreign exchange reserves, providing a buffer against currency fluctuations. Statement 3 is correct.  The question assesses understanding of macroeconomic policies and their impact on exchange rates. The distractors exploit the complexities of fiscal and monetary policy effects on currency stability.



**6. With reference to the impact of global financial crises on India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Action                                     Effect
1. Dependence on short-term foreign borrowings :   Provides immunity to global financial crises
2. Opening up to more foreign banks            :   Provides immunity to global financial crises
3. Maintaining full capital account convertibility :   Increases vulnerability to global financial crises

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Reliance on short-term foreign borrowings makes a country highly susceptible to global financial shocks as these loans can be called back quickly. Statement 1 is incorrect. Opening up to more foreign banks can increase competition and efficiency but doesn't necessarily provide immunity against external crises. Statement 2 is incorrect. Full capital account convertibility exposes a country to rapid capital flight during crises, increasing vulnerability. Statement 3 is correct. The question tests the understanding of international finance and its implications for developing economies.  Distractors play on the complexities of financial globalization and its potential benefits and drawbacks.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                 Description
1. "Command and Control"                   :   Post-1991 LPG reforms approach to economic planning
2. "Plug and Play"                          :   Government providing infrastructure support for private businesses
3. Amrit Kaal's "Panch Pran"               :  Focuses solely on economic development goals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

"Command and Control" refers to the pre-1991 centrally planned economy. Statement 1 is incorrect. "Plug and Play" accurately describes the government's facilitation of private sector initiatives by providing necessary infrastructure and policy support. Statement 2 is correct.  Amrit Kaal's "Panch Pran" encompasses a broader vision than just economic development, including social, cultural, and civic aspects. Statement 3 is incorrect. This question tests understanding of economic policy terminology and the ability to differentiate between different economic models.  Distractors use similar but incorrect interpretations of the concepts.


**8. With reference to the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                                      Correctness
1. Only BPL families are eligible for subsidized grains:   True
2. Eldest woman (18+) is the head of the household for ration cards:   False
3. Pregnant/lactating mothers are entitled to 1600 calories/day:   True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NFSA, 2013, covers a broader section of the population than just BPL families. Therefore, statement 1 is not entirely accurate. While the Act prioritizes the eldest woman for ration card issuance, it is not a strict rule. Statement 2 is therefore false.  Pregnant and lactating mothers do receive nutritional support, but the calorie target might vary slightly depending on the interpretation and implementation. Statement 3 is broadly true.  The question assesses knowledge of the NFSA, its provisions, and their interpretation. Distractors use partially true statements to test the candidate's understanding of the Act's nuances.


**9. With reference to the Shanta Kumar Committee recommendations on Food Corporation of India (FCI), consider the following pairs:**

   Recommendation                                   Focus Area
1. Procurement operations handover to states     :   PDS and NFSA
2. Re-look at the current NFSA coverage          :   Procurement
3. Gradual introduction of cash transfers in PDS   :   Stocking and movement
4. Outsourcing FCI stocking operations             :   Buffer stocking and liquidation policy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Shanta Kumar Committee recommended handing over procurement to states to improve efficiency, directly related to procurement not PDS and NFSA.  Statement 1 is mismatched.  The re-evaluation of NFSA coverage was a key recommendation of the committee, correctly matched with its focus area. Statement 2 is correctly matched.  The committee suggested gradual cash transfers as a PDS reform, not related to stocking and movement. Statement 3 is mismatched. The recommendation to outsource stocking operations falls under stocking and movement, not buffer stocking and liquidation. Statement 4 is mismatched.  The question requires detailed recall of the committee's recommendations and understanding of their context within FCI operations. Distractors are constructed using logically plausible but incorrect pairings.


**10. With reference to the PM-AASHA scheme, consider the following pairs:**

   Sub-scheme                                      Mechanism
1. Price Support Scheme (PSS)                      :  Direct payment of price difference to farmers
2. Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS)           :   Physical procurement of pulses, oilseeds, and copra
3. Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS) : Private agency procurement at MSP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PSS involves physical procurement, not direct payment. Statement 1 is incorrect. PDPS uses a direct payment mechanism based on MSP and market prices. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PPSS is correctly described as involving private agency procurement at MSP. Statement 3 is correct. The question tests knowledge of specific government schemes and their implementation mechanisms. Distractors use elements from different sub-schemes to create confusion.


**11. With reference to the PM-KISAN scheme, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                      Characteristic
1. Income support amount per year            :   Rs. 4000
2. Funding source                             :   State Governments
3. Family definition                          :   Husband, wife, and minor children

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The annual income support under PM-KISAN is Rs. 6000, not Rs. 4000. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The scheme is fully funded by the Central Government, not State Governments. Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of a family under PM-KISAN correctly includes the husband, wife, and minor children. Statement 3 is correct.  The question tests factual knowledge of a specific government scheme and its key features. The distractors involve incorrect numerical values and funding sources.


**12. With reference to agricultural extension services in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Agency/Program                                 Role/Function
1. Department of Agriculture & Cooperation (DAC) :   Establishes Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)
2. ICAR                                          :   Operates Agri-clinics and Agri-business centres
3. National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology (NMAET) : Includes Sub-Mission on Seed and Planting Material

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While DAC is involved in agricultural extension, ICAR, through its network, is the primary body establishing and running KVKs.  Statement 1 is incorrect. ICAR does support extension activities but is not the main operator of Agri-clinics and Agri-business centers.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  NMAET does include a sub-mission on seed and planting material, making this statement correct. Statement 3 is correct. The question tests knowledge of agricultural extension agencies and their respective roles. Distractors are formed by swapping functions between related agencies.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                  Description/Function
1. Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs)          :  Provide subsidized farm machinery for individual ownership
2. Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)           :   Conduct on-farm testing and technology demonstrations
3. Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Minor Forest Produce (MFPs) :  State governments can fix MSP up to 20% higher or lower than the central MSP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CHCs are for custom hiring of machinery, not individual ownership. Statement 1 is incorrect. KVKs play a vital role in on-farm testing and technology demonstrations, making statement 2 correct.  State governments have a 10% latitude, not 20%, in setting MSP for MFPs in relation to the central MSP. Statement 3 is incorrect. The question assesses knowledge of agricultural support systems and their implementation. Distractors manipulate numerical values and descriptions to test detailed understanding.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                         Definition/Description
1.  Seigniorage                             :   Profit from money creation, including interest income on reserves and inflation tax.
2.  Managed Float                          :   Exchange rate system where the central bank intervenes to moderate volatility.
3.  Free Float                              :   Exchange rate system with no central bank intervention.
4.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)          :   Exchange rate where goods cost the same in different countries when measured in the same currency.
5.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) :   Multilateral exchange rate representing the price of a basket of foreign currencies.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Seigniorage accurately describes the profit a central bank derives from money creation, encompassing interest income on reserves and the implicit tax from inflation eroding the value of currency held by the public.  A managed float is a system where the central bank intervenes to stabilize the exchange rate, contrasting with a free float where market forces solely determine the exchange rate. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) precisely defines the exchange rate at which a basket of goods costs the same in different countries. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) correctly refers to a weighted average of bilateral exchange rates against a basket of currencies.  Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Exchange Rate Regime                    Characteristic
1.  Fixed Exchange Rate                     :   Exchange rate determined by market forces of supply and demand.
2.  Flexible Exchange Rate                  :   Exchange rate set by government decisions and maintained by government actions.
3.  Managed Float                           :  Central bank intervenes to moderate exchange rate fluctuations.
4.  Currency Board                           :  Domestic currency pegged to a foreign currency at a fixed rate.
5. Dollarization                             :  Adoption of a foreign currency as the domestic currency.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Options 1 and 2 are incorrectly matched. A fixed exchange rate is determined by government actions, not market forces, while a flexible exchange rate is determined by market forces, not government actions.  Options 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  A managed float involves central bank intervention to moderate fluctuations. A currency board system rigidly pegs the domestic currency to a foreign currency, eliminating the central bank's ability to control the money supply. Dollarization is the complete replacement of the domestic currency with a foreign currency, typically the US dollar.  Therefore, only options 3, 4, and 5 are correctly paired, making (d) the correct answer.


**3. With reference to the functions of money, consider the following pairs:**

   Function of Money                         Description
1.  Medium of Exchange                     :   Facilitates storing wealth for future use.
2.  Unit of Account                         :   Expresses the value of goods and services in monetary units.
3.  Store of Value                           :   Facilitates transactions and exchanges.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The medium of exchange function of money refers to its use in facilitating transactions, not storing wealth.  Pair 2 is correct: a unit of account is a function of money where values are expressed in a common monetary unit. Pair 3 is also correct: a store of value is the function where money retains its purchasing power over time, allowing for saving and investment. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer.


**4. With reference to the Indian economy's balance of payments, consider the following pairs:**

   Account                                 Description
1.  Current Account                          :   Records international purchases and sales of assets.
2.  Capital Account                          :   Records exports and imports of goods and services, and transfer payments.
3.  Trade Balance                           :   Balance of exports and imports of goods.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The current account records transactions in goods, services, and transfer payments, not asset transactions. Pair 2 is also incorrect. The capital account records asset transactions, not goods, services, and transfer payments.  Pair 3 is correct. The trade balance is the difference between exports and imports of goods.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.


**5. With reference to the determinants of exchange rates, consider the following pairs:**

   Factor                                   Effect on Exchange Rate
1.  Increase in Domestic Interest Rates    :   Depreciation of the domestic currency.
2.  Increase in Foreign Income              :   Appreciation of the domestic currency.
3.  Increase in Domestic Income             :   Depreciation of the domestic currency.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. Higher domestic interest rates attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the domestic currency and causing appreciation, not depreciation. Pair 2 is correct. Higher foreign income increases demand for exports, leading to higher demand for the domestic currency and appreciation. Pair 3 is also correct. Higher domestic income increases demand for imports, leading to higher demand for foreign currency and depreciation of the domestic currency. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Security                          Characteristic
1.  Equity Security                         :   Represents a loan that must be repaid.
2.  Debt Security                           :   Represents ownership in a company.
3.  Debt Security                           :   Provides regular interest payments.
4.  Equity Security                         :   Offers potential capital gains (share price appreciation).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. Equity securities represent ownership, not loans. Pair 2 is incorrect; debt securities represent loans, not ownership. Pair 3 is correct; debt securities typically pay interest. Pair 4 is correct; equity securities offer potential for capital gains through share price appreciation. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                       Description
1.  Open Economy Multiplier                :   Larger than the closed economy multiplier.
2.  Marginal Propensity to Import (m)     :   Fraction of extra income spent on imports.
3.  Autonomous Expenditure                 :   Includes government spending and investment.
4.  Net Exports (NX)                        :   Exports minus imports.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The open economy multiplier is smaller than the closed economy multiplier due to import leakages. Pair 2 is correct; the marginal propensity to import is the fraction of additional income spent on imports. Pair 3 is correct; autonomous expenditure includes components independent of income, such as government spending and investment. Pair 4 is correct; net exports are the difference between exports and imports.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**8. With reference to the Indian experience with exchange rate management, consider the following pairs:**

   Period                                  Exchange Rate Regime
1.  Post-independence to 1975             :   Managed floating exchange rate.
2.  1975 to 1992                           :   Rupee pegged to a weighted basket of currencies.
3.  Post-1993                              :   Rupee pegged to the pound sterling.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. Post-independence, India initially pegged the rupee to the pound sterling, shifting to a managed floating system later. Pair 2 is correct; during this period, the rupee's exchange rate was determined within a band relative to a basket of currencies. Pair 3 is incorrect; after 1993, India moved towards a market-determined exchange rate with managed floating. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                       Characteristic
1.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)             :   Higher weight for food compared to WPI.
2.  Wholesale Price Index (WPI)            :   Includes services.
3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :   Uses WPI as its primary inflation measure.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correct.  The CPI gives a higher weight to food items than the WPI. Pair 2 is incorrect. The WPI does not capture service sector inflation, unlike the CPI. Pair 3 is incorrect. The RBI primarily uses CPI for its inflation targeting and monetary policy decisions, not WPI.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched, making (a) the correct answer.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Trade Agreement        Characteristic
1.  Free Trade Agreement (FTA)           :   Members apply a common external tariff.
2.  Customs Union (CU)                   :   Members reduce tariffs among themselves, maintaining tariffs for non-members.
3.  Common Market (CM)                  :   Free movement of factors of production among members.
4.  Economic Union (EU)                   :   Coordination of macroeconomic and exchange rate policies.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. FTAs reduce tariffs among members but maintain individual tariffs for non-members; a common external tariff is a characteristic of a customs union. Pair 2 is incorrect.  Customs unions are characterized by a common external tariff, not just reduced internal tariffs. Pair 3 is correct. Common markets allow the free movement of factors of production. Pair 4 is correct. Economic unions coordinate macroeconomic and exchange rate policies. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Agreement Feature                     Year
1. Establishment of WTO                      :   1994
2.  GATT 1994                               :   1995
3.  General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) :   2000
4.  Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) : 1970

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Uruguay Round of negotiations concluded in 1994, leading to the signing of the agreement establishing the WTO on April 15, 1994, and its coming into effect on January 1, 1995.  The updated General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 was also part of this agreement. The Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement was also a result of the Uruguay Round and came into effect along with the WTO. Option (a) is partially correct, as the WTO was established in 1994, but the agreement was signed in 1994 and came into effect in 1995. Option (b) is also partially correct, but misses the TRIPS agreement. Option (d) is incorrect as GATS negotiations began in early 2000 and were incorporated into the Doha Development Agenda in late 2001. The other agreements were concluded in 1994. Thus, only options 1,2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Trade Agreement Type                      Characteristic
1. Free Trade Agreement (FTA)                :   Common External Tariff (CET)
2. Customs Union (CU)                        :   Tariff reduction among members
3. Common Market (CM)                      :   Free movement of factors of production
4. Economic Union (EU)                       :   Coordination of macroeconomic policies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is characterized by the reduction of tariffs on trade between member countries, not by a common external tariff (CET), which is a feature of a Customs Union.  A Customs Union is indeed an FTA with a common external tariff. A Common Market is a customs union that allows for the free movement of factors of production (labor, capital). An Economic Union goes further, including coordination of macroeconomic policies. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Principle                                 Description
1. Most Favoured Nation (MFN)                :   Imported and locally produced goods treated equally
2. National Treatment (NT)                    :   Countries cannot discriminate between trading partners
3.  Progressive Liberalization                  :   Gradual lowering of trade barriers through negotiation
4. Binding and Enforceable Commitments     :   Transparency in trade regulations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Most Favoured Nation (MFN) principle states that countries cannot discriminate between their trading partners, while National Treatment mandates equal treatment of imported and locally produced goods once the foreign goods have entered the domestic market. Progressive liberalization refers to the gradual reduction of trade barriers through negotiation.  Binding and enforceable commitments involve countries agreeing to open their markets and binding those commitments, not transparency.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Agreement                                   Focus Area
1. Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures :   Domestic support in agriculture
2. Agreement on Agriculture (AoA)               :   Food safety and animal/plant health standards
3. Information Technology Agreement (ITA)        :   Tariff elimination on IT products
4. Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) : Investment regulations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures focuses on food safety and animal and plant health standards. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) aims to discipline and reduce domestic support (subsidies) in agriculture. The Information Technology Agreement (ITA) focuses on the elimination of tariffs on IT products. The Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) deals with investment regulations.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                     Key Function
1. World Bank                                  :   Exchange rate stability
2. International Monetary Fund (IMF)           :   Poverty reduction and development
3. World Trade Organization (WTO)              :   Facilitating international payments transactions
4.  Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) :  Managing international trade rules

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The World Bank’s primary function is poverty reduction and economic development. The IMF's main role is to promote international monetary cooperation and facilitate international payments transactions. The WTO's key function is to manage international trade rules. RCEP is a regional trade agreement aimed at enhancing trade and investment within the participating countries. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Economic Policy Measure                 Primary Goal
1. Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana                   :   Reduce India’s dependence on gold imports
2. Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme                     :   Bring idle gold into the economy
3. Gold Monetization Scheme                       :   Promote FDI in the gold and jewellery sector

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana aims at bringing small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme and Gold Monetization Scheme aim to bring idle gold lying with Indian households into the economy and reduce India’s dependence on gold imports.  They do not directly promote FDI in the gold and jewellery sector.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                             Characteristic
1. Commercial Paper                               :   Long-term instrument issued by RBI
2. Certificate of Deposit                           :   Short-term unsecured promissory note
3. Call Money                                      :   Short-term finance for interbank transactions
4. Zero Coupon Bonds                              :   Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Commercial paper is a short-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations. Certificates of deposit are short-term instruments issued by banks, not the RBI. Call money is indeed used for short-term interbank transactions. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay periodic interest; the return comes from the difference between the purchase price and the face value at maturity.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Function                                    Description
1. Managing Government of India Securities      :   Includes State Government Securities
2. Issuing Treasury Bills                          :   Issued only by State Governments
3. Maintaining Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)      :   Decided by individual banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RBI manages and services both Government of India and State Government Securities. Treasury bills are issued by both the central and state governments. The CAR is a regulatory requirement set by the RBI, not decided by individual banks.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Factor                             Contribution to Reducing Currency Crisis Risk
1. Foreign currency earnings of India's IT sector :   Increases government expenditure
2. Increasing government expenditure           :   May exacerbate the crisis
3. Remittances from Indians abroad             :   Provides foreign currency inflows

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Foreign currency earnings from the IT sector and remittances from Indians abroad contribute to foreign exchange reserves, thus mitigating currency crisis risk. Increasing government expenditure, without corresponding revenue increases, can worsen a balance of payments situation and increase the risk of a currency crisis. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    RBI Policy                                   Effect on Indian Rupee
1. Curbing imports and promoting exports       :   Strengthens the rupee
2. Issuing rupee-denominated Masala Bonds     :   Increases foreign currency demand for the rupee
3. Following an expansionary monetary policy  :   Weakens the rupee

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Curbing imports and promoting exports improves the trade balance, strengthening the rupee. Masala bonds issued by Indian borrowers attract foreign investment, increasing demand for the rupee. An expansionary monetary policy increases money supply, potentially leading to inflation and weakening the rupee.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Term                     Definition/Characteristic
1.  Balance of Payments (BoP)         :  Records transactions in goods, services, and assets between residents and the rest of the world.
2.  Current Account                    :  Includes foreign investments like FDI and FPI.
3.  Capital Account                    : Records exports and imports of goods and services, and transfer payments.
4.  Autonomous Transactions          : Transactions made independently of the BoP state (e.g., profit motive).
5.  Accommodating Transactions       : Determined by the net consequences of autonomous items (surplus or deficit).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Balance of Payments (BoP) is a systematic record of all economic transactions between residents of a country and the rest of the world during a specific period.  Option 1 correctly defines the BoP.  Autonomous transactions are those undertaken irrespective of the BoP's state, often driven by profit motives; this aligns with option 4. Accommodating transactions are those that adjust to balance the BoP, either addressing a surplus or deficit; this is accurately described in option 5.  Option 2 is incorrect because the current account deals with transactions that don't alter assets or liabilities; foreign investments fall under the capital account. Option 3 is incorrect as it reverses the definitions of current and capital accounts. This question tests factual recall and understanding of key macroeconomic concepts.  The distractors are plausible because they involve closely related concepts within the BoP framework, demanding precise knowledge for correct matching.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument                Description
1.  Commercial Paper                  :  A long-term unsecured promissory note issued by corporations.
2.  Certificate of Deposit              :  A short-term instrument issued by scheduled commercial banks to corporations.
3.  Call Money                         :  Short-term finance used for interbank transactions.
4.  Zero Coupon Bonds                 : Interest-bearing short-term bonds issued by scheduled commercial banks.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the description of Call Money (option 3) is accurate. Call money is indeed a short-term financial instrument used primarily for interbank transactions.  The other options present inaccurate or misleading descriptions of financial instruments. Commercial paper is a short-term, unsecured promissory note, not long-term. Certificates of Deposit are issued by banks, not necessarily commercial banks, and are short-term, not long-term. Zero-coupon bonds do not bear interest during their life; they are sold at a discount and mature at face value. This question tests factual recall related to financial instruments and assesses understanding of their characteristics. The distractors are designed to confuse candidates by altering the term or description or both, requiring precise knowledge to identify the correct match.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization           Primary Function/Objective
1.  International Monetary Fund (IMF) : To promote international monetary cooperation and facilitate payments transactions.
2.  World Bank                         : Primarily focused on financing investment and providing advisory services to businesses.
3.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB): Primarily concerned with reducing poverty in the world’s poorest countries.
4. New Development Bank (NDB)/BRICS Bank: Focuses on financing infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other emerging economies.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IMF's core function is promoting international monetary cooperation and facilitating global financial transactions, accurately reflected in Pair 1. The World Bank's primary focus is on development projects and providing financial assistance, including advisory services to private sector businesses and governments, making Pair 2 correct.  The NDB/BRICS Bank indeed finances infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS nations and other developing economies, making Pair 4 accurate.  Pair 3 is incorrect; the AIIB's main role is financing infrastructure projects, not poverty reduction, which is a key function of the World Bank's IDA. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the roles and functions of major international financial institutions. The distractors are carefully selected to test for precise knowledge, as the functions of these institutions are interrelated but distinct.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                       Explanation
1.  Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)       :  Calculated by comparing prices of different baskets of goods in different countries.
2.  Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER): An increase indicates a depreciation of the domestic currency.
3.  Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER): An increase indicates improved trade competitiveness.
4.  Money Multiplier                     : Increases with an increase in the cash reserve ratio.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only option 1 correctly describes Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). PPP is calculated by comparing the prices of identical baskets of goods and services in different countries to determine real exchange rates.  The other options offer incorrect or incomplete explanations. An increase in NEER indicates appreciation, not depreciation, of the domestic currency.  An increase in REER does not necessarily mean improved trade competitiveness; it depends on other factors. The money multiplier is inversely related to the cash reserve ratio; an increase in CRR decreases the money multiplier. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of key economic concepts and their accurate definitions. The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring a strong understanding to differentiate between closely related economic concepts.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                     Primary Objective
1.  Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana       :  To provide loans to poor farmers for cultivating specific crops.
2.  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN): To bring idle gold lying with households into the economy.
3.  Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme         : To reduce India's dependence on gold imports.
4. Kisan Credit Card Scheme            : To provide short-term credit support to farmers for working capital, post-harvest expenses, and consumption requirements.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the description for the Kisan Credit Card Scheme (Pair 4) is entirely accurate.  The scheme indeed provides short-term credit support to farmers for working capital, post-harvest expenses, and consumption needs.  The other pairs present inaccurate or misleading objectives. The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana aims to bring small entrepreneurs into the formal financial system, not provide loans solely to poor farmers.  The PM-KISAN scheme provides income support to farmers, not related to gold. The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme aims to bring idle gold into the economy and reduce India's dependence on gold imports. This question tests factual recall of government schemes and their primary goals, requiring precise knowledge to avoid the distractors.  The distractors utilize related but ultimately incorrect information about the schemes, making it crucial to have detailed knowledge.
