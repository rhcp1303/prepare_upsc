**1. Consider the following statements about Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed in 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are approximately 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and 198 DNTs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While many DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, the relationship isn't reciprocal.  Not all nomadic tribes were designated as criminal tribes under the British Raj.  The categorization under the Criminal Tribes Act was arbitrary and based on prejudiced assumptions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act, a discriminatory piece of legislation, was repealed, and the communities previously labeled as "criminal tribes" were denotified.  However, the social stigma and marginalization persisted even after the repeal.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Renke Commission, tasked with studying the issues faced by nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs, provided an estimate of their numbers in India. This estimate highlights the significant population size of these marginalized communities and the scale of the challenges they face.  The number provided is an approximation, and the exact figures may vary based on different methodologies and data collection.  The significance lies in recognizing the large number of people impacted by historical injustices and ongoing social and economic marginalization.

SHA 2011, a result of joint cooperation among the OECD, WHO, and Eurostat, provides a standard framework for producing health accounts, enabling meaningful comparisons across countries.  This standardized classification allows for better analysis of health spending trends and policy effectiveness on a global scale.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the WHO played a significant role, SHA 2011 is a collaborative effort involving the WHO, OECD, and Eurostat.  It's not solely a WHO creation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  SHA 2011 employs a three-axis classification system: consumption, provision, and financing. This means it categorizes health expenditures not only by funding source but also by the type of healthcare service consumed and who provides it. This multifaceted approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of health expenditure patterns.


**2. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, consider the following statements:**

1. In 2021-22, the total health expenditure (THE) per capita in India was less than Rs. 5,000.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008.  The number of signatories is also slightly off. The text mentions 164 signatories, not 174.  However, the core information that it was adopted, entered into force, and includes India as a signatory is accurate enough to consider the statement largely correct in the context of the other statements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Biwako Millennium Framework is a separate initiative working towards an inclusive society for people with disabilities, it's not a supplementary document to the UN-CRPD.  It has a broader focus than just children's rights.

Statement 3 is correct. The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties did indeed have the stated theme.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are largely correct.  The minor inaccuracies in statement 1 do not invalidate its overall truthfulness when compared to the inaccuracies in statement 2.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 are indeed the successor to the International Sanitary Regulations, which were last revised in 1969.  The IHR 2005 aims to establish a legally binding framework for countries to collaboratively address public health events with international implications.  It outlines countries’ rights and obligations in handling such emergencies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the amendments adopted at the 77th World Health Assembly did redefine pandemic emergencies, the new definition includes communicable diseases with "wide geographical spread" or a high risk of one, and exceeding or potentially exceeding the capacity of national health systems.  A high mortality rate is not the sole criterion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IHR 2005 includes all 194 WHO Member States, and also includes observer states like the Holy See and Liechtenstein.  The exclusion of observer states is inaccurate.



**2. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD, adopted in 2006 and entering into force in 2008, mandates affirmative action for persons with disabilities only in the public sector.
2.  The UN-CRPD defines persons with disabilities as individuals with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments that hinder their full and effective participation in society.
3. India is one of the 180 signatory countries of the UN-CRPD, actively implementing its provisions through various national policies and schemes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD promotes the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. While it doesn't explicitly mandate affirmative action solely in the public sector, it encourages comprehensive measures across all sectors of society to ensure inclusion.  The convention promotes a broader approach to inclusion that extends beyond just the public sector.

Statement 2 is correct. The UN-CRPD's definition of persons with disabilities encompasses individuals with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While India is a signatory to the UN-CRPD, the number of signatory countries is 164, not 180.  The exact number of implementing countries varies depending on the stage of ratification and implementation.  The statement overestimates the number of signatories.



**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA, launched by the Prime Minister, aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by focusing solely on skill development and entrepreneurship initiatives.
2.  The scheme is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known for his resistance against British rule, and draws lessons from the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN).
3. PM-JUGA's funding is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds specifically earmarked for this program, independent of existing development schemes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-JUGA's objective is broader than just skill development and entrepreneurship. It aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods through convergence and outreach of various existing schemes.  It's a multi-faceted approach to improving tribal well-being.

Statement 2 is correct.  PM-JUGA is indeed named after Birsa Munda and aims to learn from the successes and experiences of PM-JANMAN.  This connection to a significant tribal leader and the use of prior schemes' knowledge are key features.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PM-JUGA utilizes funding from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. It does not rely on entirely new, dedicated funding.


**4. With reference to Passive Euthanasia in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India, in the Aruna Shanbaug case, legalized both active and passive euthanasia, allowing for the termination of life support in terminally ill patients under specific conditions.
2.  The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has released draft guidelines for passive euthanasia, outlining procedures for withdrawing life-sustaining treatments (LST) based on the Supreme Court's directives.
3. The Karnataka High Court was the first state high court to allow passive euthanasia, paving the way for other states to follow suit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. In the Aruna Shanbaug case, the Supreme Court only legalized passive euthanasia, not active euthanasia. Active euthanasia, which involves actively ending a patient's life, remains illegal in India. The court's decision focused on the right to a dignified death through passive means.

Statement 2 is correct. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare did release draft guidelines for passive euthanasia, detailing the process of withdrawing LST.  These guidelines are partly based on the Supreme Court's pronouncements on the matter.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Kerala, not Karnataka, was the first state to allow passive euthanasia, following Supreme Court directives. Karnataka became the second state to implement such provisions.


**5. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The PWDVA, enacted under Article 15(3) of the Constitution, defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse and excludes other forms of violence like emotional or economic abuse.
2.  The Supreme Court's ruling in the Hiral P Harsora case removed the gender specification ("adult male") from the definition of the perpetrator under the PWDVA.
3. The PWDVA provides for both civil and criminal remedies for victims of domestic violence, including the possibility of imprisonment for perpetrators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA defines domestic violence comprehensively, including physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.  The act's scope goes beyond just physical harm to encompass a wide range of abusive behaviors.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's decision in the Hiral P Harsora case indeed removed the gender-specific language ("adult male") from the definition of the perpetrator, broadening the scope of the act to include all perpetrators irrespective of gender.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PWDVA primarily provides for civil remedies, not criminal ones. While criminal charges might be filed separately under other laws, the PWDVA itself focuses on civil protection orders and other non-criminal measures.  Imprisonment is not a direct consequence under the PWDVA.


**6. With reference to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, and its amendments, consider the following statements:**

1. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, increased the upper gestational limit for abortion to 28 weeks under all circumstances.
2.  The MTP Act, 1971, allows for the termination of pregnancies only by registered medical practitioners (RMPs).
3. The 2021 amendment introduced provisions for seeking abortion beyond 24 weeks only in cases of substantial foetal abnormalities, requiring a medical board's opinion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, did not increase the upper gestational limit for abortion to 28 weeks under all circumstances. The limit remains 24 weeks for most cases, with exceptions for specific categories of women and cases of substantial foetal abnormalities.

Statement 2 is correct. The MTP Act, 1971, explicitly stipulates that only registered medical practitioners (RMPs) are authorized to perform abortions. This is a crucial aspect of the act’s regulatory framework.

Statement 3 is correct.  The 2021 amendment allows for abortion beyond 24 weeks but only under specific circumstances, primarily involving substantial foetal abnormalities.  A medical board's opinion is required in such cases, ensuring that the decision is medically justified.



**1. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD, adopted in 2006 and entering into force in 2008, aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.  
2. The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties to the UN-CRPD focused on rethinking disability inclusion in the context of the upcoming Summit of the Future, with a particular focus on the challenges posed by climate change to persons with disabilities.
3.  The UN-CRPD has 164 signatories, including India, and defines persons with disabilities as those who have short-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the UN-CRPD's objective.  The convention's core purpose is to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy the same rights and freedoms as everyone else, emphasizing their inherent dignity.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the theme of the 17th session, although the specific focus on climate change is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, the overall theme aligns with the broader concerns of disability inclusion in the international arena. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the number of signatories is accurate, the definition of disability in the UN-CRPD specifies *long-term* impairments, not short-term ones.  Short-term impairments would not typically fall under the definition of disability as understood within the framework of the convention.  The focus is on impairments that significantly and enduringly impact a person's life.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA, launched by the Prime Minister, aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by focusing on the saturation of critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, and education, primarily through the allocation of funds from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs' budget.
2. The scheme is named after Birsa Munda, known as "Dharti Aaba," who led the "Ulgulan" movement against the British Raj, and incorporates lessons learned from the successful Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN).
3.  A key feature of PM-JUGA is the implementation of micro-plans through the formulation of Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans, with a particular emphasis on promoting sustainable agriculture practices and reducing reliance on traditional forest-based livelihoods.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While PM-JUGA does aim to improve socio-economic conditions and address gaps in infrastructure, health, and education, the funding primarily comes from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes, not solely from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs' budget. Statement 2 is entirely correct, accurately describing the scheme's namesake and its connection to PM-JANMAN. Statement 3 is incorrect. While PM-JUGA does involve micro-plans and CCD plans, the provided text doesn't specify a particular emphasis on sustainable agriculture or reducing reliance on traditional forest-based livelihoods.  The focus is broader, encompassing various aspects of social infrastructure and livelihood improvement.


**3. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court's judgment in the Sukanya Santha case addressed caste-based discrimination within prisons, specifically highlighting the discriminatory practices against DNTs and "habitual offenders," leading to the striking down of discriminatory provisions in several states' prison manuals.
2.  DNTs, originally "notified" as "born criminals" under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871 (repealed in 1949), are a heterogeneous group with diverse occupations, and many have since been included in Scheduled Tribes (ST), Scheduled Caste (SC), and Other Backward Caste (OBC) lists.
3. The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are approximately 10 crore Indians belonging to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs, with August 31st celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNTs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Supreme Court's ruling in the Sukanya Santha case and its implications for DNTs within the prison system. Statement 2 is also correct, outlining the historical context of DNTs and their diverse backgrounds and subsequent inclusion in various caste categories. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Renke Commission did estimate the number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs, the figure provided in the text is 15 crore, not 10 crore.  The date of Vimukta Jatis Day is also correctly stated.  The discrepancy in the population figure makes statement 3 inaccurate.


**4. With reference to the Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Accessible India Campaign, launched in 2015, aims to create a barrier-free environment for persons with disabilities across various sectors, including transportation, infrastructure, and information and communication technology (ICT), with a focus on achieving universal accessibility by 2022.
2.  The campaign is primarily funded through the allocation of funds from the National Trust for the Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation, and Multiple Disabilities Act, 1999.
3. Key initiatives under the campaign include the creation of accessible websites, the development of accessible public transportation systems, and the provision of assistive devices to persons with disabilities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Accessible India Campaign aims to create a barrier-free environment and includes the sectors mentioned, the target year for universal accessibility is not explicitly stated in the provided text. Statement 2 is incorrect. The funding sources for the Accessible India Campaign are not specified in the given text, but it's unlikely to be solely dependent on the National Trust mentioned.  Statement 3 is correct and accurately reflects some of the key initiatives undertaken as part of the campaign.  The focus on website accessibility, public transport, and assistive devices aligns with the overall goals of the campaign.


**5. With reference to the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCMA), consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court's ruling in the Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action v. UoI case clarified that the PCMA supersedes personal laws and traditions in the prohibition of child marriage, emphasizing the need for uniform application of the law regardless of religious or customary practices.
2.  The PCMA mandates the establishment of Child Marriage Prevention Officers (CMPOs) at the state and district levels, along with the creation of specialized police units and state-level special child marriage prohibition units to enhance enforcement.
3.  The PCMA provides for the establishment of special fast-track courts to expedite the trial of child marriage cases and ensures that all cases are handled within a stipulated timeframe of six months from the date of filing.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Supreme Court's interpretation of the PCMA's supremacy over conflicting personal laws and traditions. Statement 2 correctly describes the PCMA's provisions for establishing CMPOs and specialized units to strengthen enforcement. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the PCMA does advocate for expediting the trial process, it does not mandate a specific six-month timeframe for handling all cases. The actual timeframe may vary depending on the complexity of each case and the availability of court resources.  The absence of a fixed timeframe makes statement 3 inaccurate.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016:**

1. The Act completely prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all occupations.
2.  The Act allows adolescents (14-18 years) to work in any occupation they choose, regardless of its hazardous nature.
3. The Act includes exceptions for children assisting in family enterprises and participating in certain artistic or sporting activities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, while aiming to prohibit child labor, does not offer a blanket ban on all forms of child employment.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the act does not prohibit *all* forms of child labor under 14 years, allowing for exceptions. Statement 2 is incorrect as the act specifically prohibits adolescents (14-18 years) from engaging in hazardous occupations. Statement 3 is correct; the Act provides exceptions for children assisting in family enterprises and involvement in specific non-hazardous activities like artistic performances or sports (excluding circus).  The Act's nuanced approach reflects the complexities of defining and addressing child labor, acknowledging the difference between exploitative labor and permissible family participation. The act seeks to balance the protection of children with the realities of socio-economic conditions in certain communities.


**2. With reference to the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCMA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PCMA defines a child as a male below 18 years of age and a female below 21 years of age.
2. The Act mandates the appointment of Child Marriage Prevention Officers (CMPOs) in every state to prevent child marriages and ensure victim protection.
3.  The annulment of a child marriage can only be sought within one year of the marriage being solemnized.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PCMA defines a child differently than what's presented. The act defines a child as a male under 21 and a female under 18. Statement 2 is correct; the PCMA explicitly mandates the appointment of CMPOs across all states to actively prevent child marriages and provide support to victims.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act allows for the annulment of a child marriage to be sought within 2 years after the child involved attains majority (18 for females, 21 for males), not within one year of the marriage itself. This reflects a recognition that victims may need time to process the situation and seek legal recourse. The provision for annulment highlights the Act's focus on protecting the rights and well-being of children affected by child marriage.


**3. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2006.
2. The convention aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.
3. India is not a signatory to the UN-CRPD.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2008, not 2006.  The convention was adopted in 2006, but there's a difference between adoption and entry into force. Statement 2 is correct. The core objective of the UN-CRPD is to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities, emphasizing their inherent dignity.  Statement 3 is incorrect. India is a signatory to the UN-CRPD, demonstrating its commitment to upholding the rights of persons with disabilities. The participation of India underscores the global effort to ensure inclusive and equitable societies.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA):**

1. The scheme is solely funded through newly allocated funds specifically designated for this initiative.
2. The scheme aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood.
3.  The scheme is named after a prominent tribal leader who resisted British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-JUGA doesn't rely on entirely new funding; it utilizes existing funds from the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  Statement 2 is correct. The scheme's primary goal is to enhance the socio-economic well-being of tribal communities by addressing deficiencies in essential areas like infrastructure, healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. Statement 3 is also correct. The scheme is named after Birsa Munda, a significant tribal leader who spearheaded resistance against British colonial rule. The naming reflects the scheme's focus on empowering tribal communities and honoring their historical struggles.  The convergence of existing schemes under PM-JUGA represents a strategic approach to achieving holistic development in tribal areas.


**5. With reference to provisions for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian government mandates that at least 10% of the workforce in the private sector must consist of PwDs.
2. The concept of "limited guardianship" allows for joint decision-making between a guardian and a PwD, respecting the PwD's will.
3.  The government is not obligated to create social security programs to ensure an adequate standard of living for PwDs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian government incentivizes, but does not mandate, a specific percentage (5%, not 10%) of PwDs in private sector workforces.  The government encourages private sector participation in inclusive employment practices. Statement 2 is correct. The concept of "limited guardianship" is designed to empower PwDs by enabling joint decision-making processes that respect their autonomy and preferences.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The government is legally obligated to formulate social security programs aimed at ensuring an adequate standard of living for PwDs, enabling them to live independently or within their communities. This commitment reflects the government's responsibility to protect the rights and well-being of PwDs.  The implementation of these provisions varies, however the legal obligation remains.


**6.  With reference to the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates that appeals against preliminary assessment orders of the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) must be filed before the Sessions Court.
2. The Act provides for a mandatory 3-month time limit for completing the preliminary assessment of a Child in Conflict with Law (CCL).
3. The Act allows for Child Care Leave (CCL) for female employees and single male parents caring for children, with certain conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Appeals against JJB preliminary assessment orders are to be filed before the Children's Court (where available), not the Sessions Court. This is a crucial distinction emphasizing the specialized nature of juvenile justice proceedings. Statement 2 is incorrect. The 3-month timeframe for preliminary assessments under the Juvenile Justice Act is not mandatory but rather a guideline.  This allows for flexibility based on the specific circumstances of each case. Statement 3 is correct, although the Juvenile Justice Act itself doesn't directly address CCL.  The mention of CCL in the context of this Act usually refers to  separate provisions (like Rule 43-C of the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules, 1972) that grant CCL to government employees, which is often discussed in relation to the broader context of children's welfare and parental leave.  The linkage underscores the importance of supportive policies for parents.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961:**

1. The Act only applies to permanent employees, excluding contractual workers.
2. The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 increased the paid maternity leave to 26 weeks for women with less than two surviving children.
3. The Act does not provide any provisions for work from home for nursing mothers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A Madras High Court ruling clarified that contractual employees are also entitled to maternity benefits under the Act, emphasizing that the Act's provisions supersede less favorable contractual terms. Statement 2 is correct; the 2017 amendment significantly extended paid maternity leave to 26 weeks for women with fewer than two surviving children, promoting better maternal and child health outcomes.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The 2017 amendment introduced provisions for work from home for nursing mothers, depending on the nature of their work. This provision recognizes the challenges faced by working mothers and promotes work-life balance.  The amendment reflects a progressive approach to supporting women in the workforce.


**8. With reference to the legal framework surrounding abortion in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, allows for abortion up to 24 weeks in all circumstances.
2. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, introduced stricter regulations on abortions beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy.
3.  The Supreme Court has interpreted the MTP Act to include marital rape as a ground for abortion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MTP Act, while allowing for abortion, does not permit it up to 24 weeks in all circumstances. The permissible gestational limit varies depending on the circumstances and requires the opinion of one or two registered medical practitioners (RMPs), as specified under the Act and its amendments.  Statement 2 is correct.  The 2021 amendment introduced tighter restrictions on abortions beyond 20 weeks, requiring the opinion of two RMPs and limiting access to specific categories of women.  Statement 3 is also correct.  The Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling, extended the right to safe and legal abortion up to 24 weeks for unmarried and single women and clarified that marital rape, for the purposes of the MTP Act, should be considered rape.  This judicial interpretation expanded the scope of the law to better protect women's reproductive rights.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding Surrogacy laws in India:**

1. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, permits both altruistic and commercial surrogacy.
2.  The Act establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) to oversee the implementation of the Act.
3. Traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is genetically related to the child, is explicitly permitted under the Act.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy where no monetary compensation is involved beyond basic medical expenses and insurance.  Statement 2 is correct. The Act established the NARTSB to regulate and monitor the implementation of surrogacy practices, ensuring ethical and responsible procedures.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act effectively bans traditional surrogacy as it promotes gestational surrogacy (where the surrogate mother is not genetically related to the child).  This is a key element of the Act, aiming to prevent exploitation and promote ethical practices within the surrogacy framework.  The creation of the NARTSB reflects the government's efforts to regulate this sensitive area while protecting the rights of all parties involved.


**10. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency to include only communicable diseases with extremely high mortality rates.
2.  The amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism to support developing countries in responding to public health emergencies.
3. The amendments eliminate the role of national IHR authorities in coordinating responses within countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The amendments to the IHR broaden the definition of a pandemic emergency to include communicable diseases with a wide geographical spread or a high risk of such spread, exceeding or potentially exceeding the capacity of national health systems to respond effectively. It is not limited to only high mortality rates. Statement 2 is correct. The amendments introduce a coordinating financial mechanism to assist developing countries in addressing the financial challenges associated with responding to public health emergencies. This addresses inequalities in global health preparedness and response. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The amendments strengthen the role of national IHR authorities by emphasizing improved coordination among countries and within countries to enhance preparedness and response capabilities.  The establishment of this mechanism reflects a commitment to global collaboration and equitable resource allocation in addressing pandemics.


**1. With reference to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) as per the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, consider the following statements:**

1. The ICC must include at least one external member from a women's NGO.
2.  The Presiding Officer of the ICC must be a woman employed at a junior level within the organization.
3. The ICC's term is limited to a maximum of 2 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act mandates the establishment of ICCs in workplaces with 10 or more employees.  Statement 1 is correct as the Act specifies that the ICC should include at least one external member from an NGO or association working for women's rights, or a person familiar with issues relating to sexual harassment. This ensures an unbiased perspective and expertise in handling such sensitive cases. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Presiding Officer must be a woman employed at a *senior* level within the organization, reflecting the importance of authority and experience in leading the committee's investigations and decisions. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the ICC's maximum term is 3 years, not 2 years, allowing for continuity and consistent handling of complaints.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 2 and 3.  Understanding the composition and tenure of the ICC is crucial for effective implementation of the POSH Act and ensuring a safe and respectful workplace for women.


**2. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The PWDVA, 2005, is enacted under Article 15(2) of the Constitution of India, which allows for special provisions for women and children.
2. The Act covers only legally married women facing domestic abuse.
3. A complaint under the PWDVA can only be filed against the husband of the aggrieved woman.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, is a landmark legislation aimed at protecting women from all forms of domestic violence.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act is enacted under Article 15(3), not 15(2), of the Constitution. Article 15(3) empowers the state to make special provisions for women and children. Statement 2 is incorrect as the Act's coverage extends to all women irrespective of their marital status, including mothers, sisters, wives, widows, and partners living in a shared household.  It also includes children as beneficiaries. Statement 3 is also incorrect; a complaint can be filed against any person who is or has been in a domestic relationship with the aggrieved woman, which is a much broader definition than just the husband.  The broad scope of the PWDVA is crucial in addressing the diverse forms and contexts of domestic violence. The incorrect nature of all three statements highlights the importance of accurate understanding of the Act's provisions.


**3. With reference to the Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a "wide geographical spread" or a high risk of one, exceeding national health system response capacity.
2. The amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism primarily for developed countries to assist developing nations.
3. The revised IHR includes the establishment of regional IHR authorities to improve coordination within geographical regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the IHR, 2005, aim to strengthen global health security in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Statement 1 accurately reflects a key amendment: the definition of a pandemic emergency now includes the crucial element of exceeding the capacity of national health systems to respond, highlighting the need for international cooperation. Statement 2 is incorrect; the amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism to address the needs and priorities of *developing* countries, recognizing their greater vulnerability during public health emergencies.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the amendments create *National*, not regional, IHR authorities to improve coordination among countries. The focus on national authorities reflects the primary responsibility of individual states in managing public health events while acknowledging the need for international collaboration.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 2 and 3.  Understanding the specific changes brought about by the amendments is critical for effective global health governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA is a significant initiative for the empowerment of tribal communities. Statement 1 is incorrect; the scheme's tenure is 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29), not 10 years.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the scheme utilizes existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes, not newly allocated funds. This demonstrates a commitment to efficient resource allocation. Statement 3 is incorrect as PM-JUGA adopts a multi-pronged approach, encompassing interventions in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood enhancement,  not just infrastructure alone.  The scheme’s holistic approach is crucial for sustainable and comprehensive development.  The incorrect nature of all statements underscores the need for a thorough understanding of the scheme's objectives and implementation strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UGC regulations aim to facilitate the entry of high-ranked foreign universities into India. Statement 1 is incorrect; the eligibility criteria for FHEIs to set up campuses in India is that they should be ranked in the global top 500, either overall or in relevant subject areas, or possess outstanding expertise in a particular area.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the UGC initially grants in-principle approval and issues a Letter of Intent (LoI).  The final establishment is subject to fulfilling conditions outlined within the LoI. Statement 3 is correct; FHEIs are granted autonomy to determine qualifications, salary structures, and other conditions of service for their faculty and staff.  This provision aims to attract high-quality talent and maintain academic standards.  The other options are incorrect because of the inaccuracies in statements 1 and 2.  Understanding the regulatory framework governing foreign university campuses in India is vital for assessing its impact on the higher education sector.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NFHS-5 report provides valuable insights into the health and well-being of Indians. Statement 1 is incorrect; NFHS surveys are not released biennially, the precise frequency is not fixed.  Statement 2 is correct; the NFHS-5 data collection involved a nationally representative sample of households, ensuring the findings are generalizable to the Indian population. Statement 3 is incorrect; while maternal and child health are significant components, the NFHS-5 covers a wide range of health indicators, including nutrition, family planning, and non-communicable diseases.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 1 and 3.  Understanding the scope and methodology of the NFHS-5 is crucial for interpreting its findings accurately.

(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD is a landmark international treaty promoting disability rights. Statement 1 is incorrect; the UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 but entered into force in 2008, not 2006.  Statement 2 is incorrect; India *is* a signatory to the UN-CRPD.  Statement 3 is correct; the convention's primary objective is to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 1 and 2.  Awareness of India's commitment to the UN-CRPD and its core principles is essential for understanding the country's disability rights framework.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA is a comprehensive program for tribal development. Statement 1 is incorrect; PM-JUGA is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader who resisted British rule, not Tantia Tope. Statement 2 is correct; improving village infrastructure, including all-weather road connectivity (through PM Gram Sadak Yojana), is a key goal of PM-JUGA. Statement 3 is incorrect; while health and nutrition are addressed (through National Health Mission and Poshan), PM-JUGA has a broader scope, including skill development, livelihood enhancement, and education. The other options are incorrect because of the inaccuracies in statements 1 and 3.  Understanding the multifaceted nature of PM-JUGA is key to appreciating its developmental goals.

Understanding the methodologies and criteria of different university ranking systems is crucial for a nuanced evaluation of institutional performance.



**1. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2006 and has 184 signatory countries, including India.
2.  The Biwako Millennium Framework is a key document guiding the implementation of the UN-CRPD in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on inclusive and barrier-free societies.
3. The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties to the UN-CRPD focused on rethinking disability inclusion in the context of the upcoming Summit of the Future.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008.  While it has a large number of signatories, the exact number is not 184 but rather 164, including India. The question uses a close but incorrect figure to act as a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Biwako Millennium Framework promotes inclusive societies, it's not specifically linked to the UN-CRPD implementation in the Asia-Pacific region in the way the statement implies.  The statement attempts to link two related but separate concepts to confuse the candidate. The framework's goals align with the spirit of the convention, but it isn't a direct implementation document.

Statement 3 is correct. The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties indeed had the theme of rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future. This is a verifiable fact from the provided text.


**2. With reference to Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities over a 10-year period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The scheme's duration is 5 years (2024-29), not 10.  The number of years is altered to create a plausible but incorrect distractor. The objective of saturating critical gaps is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The scheme uses existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, not newly allocated funds.  This is a crucial detail that differentiates the scheme's funding mechanism.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While the number of interventions and focus areas are accurate, the number of line ministries involved is 17, not 12. The slight alteration in the number of ministries is used as a distractor.


**3. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The NIRF 2024 rankings included new categories for Open Universities, Private Universities, and Skill Universities.
2.  The Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, topped the overall category for the ninth consecutive time in NIRF 2024.
3.  The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2025 included 18 indicators to assess universities across five key areas, ranking IISc, Bangalore, within the 251-300 bracket.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While new categories were added, the statement incorrectly mentions "Private Universities." The actual additions were Open Universities and State Public Universities, along with Skill Universities.  The inclusion of "Private Universities" is a deliberate attempt at misdirection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. IIT Madras, not IISc Bangalore, topped the overall category.  This is a clear and significant factual error designed to test recall. IISc Bangalore topped the Universities category.

Statement 3 is correct. The details regarding THE rankings, the number of indicators, assessment areas, and IISc's ranking are accurate.


**4. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

1. ANRF was established under the ANRF Act 2023, subsuming the erstwhile Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), with a funding target of ₹60,000 crore for 2023-2028.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The funding target is ₹50,000 crore, not ₹60,000 crore.  The slight alteration in the funding amount is designed to act as a distractor.  The other details mentioned are correct.

Statement 2 is correct.  PAIR and MAHA are indeed key initiatives, and the mentioned focus areas are accurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Prime Minister chairs the Governing Board, not the Union Minister of Science and Technology. The Union Minister is a Vice-President of the Board.  This reversal of roles is a key distractor in the question.


**5. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 ranked India 129th out of 146 countries, showing a significant improvement from its 2023 ranking.
2. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022 ranked India 108th out of 193 countries, indicating a decline in gender inequality compared to 2021.
3.  The Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality, launched in Davos 2024, is a global collective supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and anchored by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's ranking is correct, the statement wrongly claims a significant improvement. The ranking actually shows a slight decline compared to 2023.  This subtle alteration is a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The GII 2022 ranking and the comparison with 2021 are accurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The details about the Alliance for Global Good are accurate, including its supporters and anchor organization.


**6. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 and initiatives to tackle hunger in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024 ranked India 105th out of 127 countries, indicating a significant improvement in hunger levels compared to the previous year.
2.  Initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana aim to address food insecurity and malnutrition.
3.  The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, legally recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ranking is correct,  the statement incorrectly describes the improvement as "significant." The improvement is relatively small and falls within the "serious" category.  This is a key distractor playing on the interpretation of data.

Statement 2 is correct.  PMGKAY and PMMVY are indeed crucial initiatives aimed at addressing food insecurity and malnutrition.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NFSA recognizes the right to food as a *statutory* right, not a fundamental right.  This subtle but important distinction is a major point of divergence.


**7. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHA Estimates for India are derived from the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011, a global standard framework for producing health accounts developed by the World Bank, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
2.  In 2021-22, Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP increased, while Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as a percentage of THE decreased.
3.  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of THE increased in 2021-22, indicating a greater role of government funding in healthcare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the SHA 2011 is the basis,  the statement incorrectly mentions the World Bank, UNICEF as developers. The correct developers are the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), WHO, and Eurostat.  The inclusion of incorrect organizations is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The trends for THE and OOPE are accurately reflected.

Statement 3 is correct. The increase in GHE as a percentage of THE is accurately stated.


**8. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes and Forest Rights Act (FRA) and Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

2. Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and union territories, with 13 such groups.
3.  The ‘Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)’ Scheme provides 100% central assistance, focusing on socio-economic development while preserving cultural heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FRA's definition of 'habitat' is broader than stated; it includes customary habitats and other habitats in both reserved and protected forests. The restrictive definition in the statement is a deliberate attempt to mislead.

Statement 2 is correct. Odisha does have the highest number of recognized PVTGs.

Statement 3 is correct.  The description of the PVTG development scheme is accurate.


**1. With reference to the QS World University Rankings and Times Higher Education (THE) University Impact Rankings, consider the following statements:**

1.  The QS World University Rankings 2025 utilized 10 performance indicators to rank universities globally, placing IIT Bombay as the top-ranked Indian institution.
2.  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham secured the 81st rank in the THE University Impact Rankings 2024, based on its performance across multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
3.  India's representation in the THE University Impact Rankings 2024 was surpassed only by the United Kingdom, with over 100 Indian institutions featured.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The QS World University Rankings 2025 uses 9, not 10, performance indicators. While IIT Bombay is indeed the top-ranked Indian institution, the number of indicators is misstated.  Statement 2 is correct; Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham did achieve the 81st rank in the THE University Impact Rankings 2024 based on its performance across the UN SDGs. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage states India is the *most* represented country, implying no other country had more institutions listed, not that it was surpassed only by the UK.  The exact number of Indian institutions in THE rankings is 96,  a figure which may be less than some other countries.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to the establishment of foreign university campuses in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The University of Southampton's campus in Gurugram is the first international university campus established in India under the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023.
2.  Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) must be ranked among the global top 200 to be eligible to establish campuses in India under the UGC regulations.
3. The UGC regulations permit only single FHEIs to establish campuses independently; collaborations between multiple FHEIs are not allowed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage explicitly states that the University of Southampton's Gurugram campus is the first to be established under the 2023 regulations. Statement 2 is incorrect. The regulations require FHEIs to be ranked in the global top 500, either overall or in relevant subject areas, not the top 200.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. The regulations explicitly state that two or more FHEIs *can* collaborate to set up campuses, provided each meets the individual eligibility criteria.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**3. With reference to the Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality, consider the following statements:**

1. The Alliance is a solely government-led initiative focused on improving women’s health in developing nations.
2. The World Economic Forum (WEF) plays a significant role in supporting the Alliance's activities, serving as a primary funder.
3. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and CII Centre for Women Leadership are supporting partners to the Alliance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Alliance is a global collective involving governments, industry, and development organizations. It addresses women's health, education, and enterprise, not solely focusing on health in developing nations. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the WEF endorsed the Alliance and is a network partner, it's not the primary funder.  The passage mentions the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as a supporting entity. Statement 3 is correct. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and CII Centre for Women Leadership are explicitly named as supporting partners. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are partially correct, although statement 2 is largely inaccurate regarding funding.


**4. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The POSH Act defines sexual harassment based on the definition provided in the Vishaka judgment, requiring organizations with fewer than 10 employees to establish Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs).
2. An ICC must include at least one male member among its composition to ensure gender balance in handling complaints.
3. The Local Complaints Committee (LCC) handles complaints only when the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) fails to address them appropriately.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  The POSH Act does define sexual harassment based on the Vishaka judgment, but it mandates ICCs for organizations with *10 or more* employees, not fewer. Statement 2 is incorrect. The POSH Act mandates that the presiding officer of an ICC be a woman, but doesn't specify a minimum number of male members; the focus is on having a woman in a senior position to lead the committee.  Statement 3 is largely correct.  While the LCC is indeed there for complaints that the ICC cannot resolve adequately, the phrasing is more precise.  The LCC is used when an organization doesn't have an ICC or when the ICC is deemed biased or ineffective.  Therefore, only statement 3 is mostly accurate, although not perfectly worded.


**5. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines 'habitat' as the area comprising only the customary habitat of primitive tribal groups within reserved forests.
2. Habitat rights under the FRA are granted after a single consultation with the relevant forest department.
3. The FRA has granted habitat rights to several tribal groups in states like Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FRA's definition of 'habitat' is broader; it includes customary habitats and other habitats in *reserved and protected* forests, encompassing pre-agricultural communities and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The FRA mandates a sequence of consultations with various stakeholders, not just a single consultation with the forest department. Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the granting of habitat rights to specific tribal groups in the states listed. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**6.  With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include a high literacy rate and a robust, growing economy.
2.  Odisha has the lowest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and union territories.
3. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme provides 100% central assistance, focusing on socio-economic development while preserving cultural heritage.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs are the opposite: low literacy rates, a subsistence economy, and a stagnant or declining population. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Odisha has the *highest* number of recognized PVTGs. Statement 3 is correct. The passage accurately describes the scheme's objectives, funding mechanism, and focus on holistic development while respecting cultural heritage. Thus, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**7. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and Nomadic Tribes, consider the following statements:**

1. All nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs.
2. The Supreme Court's Sukanya Santha vs. UoI case addressed issues of caste-based discrimination against DNTs and "habitual offenders" in prisons.
3.  DNTs are a homogeneous group primarily engaged in traditional agricultural practices.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage clarifies that all nomadic tribes are not DNTs, though all DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic. Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court case directly addressed the issue of caste-based discrimination against DNTs within the prison system. Statement 3 is incorrect. DNTs are a heterogeneous group with diverse occupations, including transport, trade, entertainment, and pastoralism, not solely focused on agriculture. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA's core objective is to address critical shortcomings in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood opportunities within tribal communities.  It achieves this through a convergence strategy, leveraging pre-existing government schemes and enhancing their outreach to ensure comprehensive development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Abhiyan's funding mechanism does not involve the creation of entirely new funding streams. Instead, it strategically utilizes existing funds allocated under the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) within Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  This emphasizes resource optimization and efficient allocation of existing budgetary provisions.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Abhiyan incorporates several key initiatives, including the promotion of tribal homestays under the Swadesh Darshan scheme to boost tourism and generate income, and the establishment of TMMCs to facilitate better market access for tribal producers, reducing post-harvest losses and ensuring fair prices for their products.  These components reflect a multi-pronged approach to sustainable tribal empowerment.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The GHI 2024 paints a concerning picture, revealing that hunger levels in numerous countries remain alarmingly high, making the achievement of the 2030 Zero Hunger goal highly improbable based on current trends.  The report emphasizes the significant challenges that still need to be overcome to substantially reduce global hunger.

Statement 2 is correct. India's GHI score did show improvement from 2023 to 2024; however,  it remains categorized as "serious," indicating the persistence of significant hunger-related challenges within the country. This underscores the need for continued and intensified efforts to improve nutritional outcomes and food security.

Statement 3 is correct. The report strongly emphasizes the links between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.  It highlights the disproportionate impact of food insecurity and malnutrition on women and girls, worsened by the effects of extreme weather events and climate-related emergencies.  This gendered dimension of hunger requires targeted interventions and policies to address the specific vulnerabilities faced by women.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NHA estimates indicate an *increase* in THE as a percentage of GDP in 2021-22 compared to 2017-18, reflecting a rise in overall health spending relative to the national economy.  This trend suggests growing investment in the healthcare sector.

Statement 2 is correct.  The data shows that GHE as a percentage of THE did indeed increase in 2021-22 compared to 2017-18.  This signifies a larger share of overall health spending being financed by government sources, indicative of increased public investment in healthcare.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NHA estimates reveal a *decrease* in OOPE as a percentage of THE in 2021-22 compared to 2017-18.  This signifies a reduction in the proportion of healthcare costs borne directly by households, suggesting a positive shift towards reduced financial burden on individuals seeking healthcare services.  This could be attributed to increased health insurance coverage or other government initiatives aimed at reducing out-of-pocket expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PM-JUGA aims to significantly improve educational outcomes for tribal communities, it does not explicitly set a target of achieving 100% literacy within a five-year timeframe.  The Abhiyan's focus is on enhancing access to quality education and improving overall educational infrastructure and opportunities, but the specific target of complete literacy is not stated.

Statement 2 is correct.  PM-JUGA explicitly includes the improvement of infrastructure in government residential schools and hostels for tribal children as a key component of its overall strategy to improve educational access and quality.  This initiative reflects a commitment to providing better learning environments for tribal students.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Abhiyan aims to ensure access to healthcare services for tribal populations and includes providing Ayushman Bharat cards (PM Jan Arogya Yojana) to eligible households.  This initiative aims to enhance healthcare access and reduce the financial burden associated with healthcare costs for tribal communities.

2.  The program provides financial assistance including capitalization support through a Revolving Fund (RF) and Community Investment Fund (CIF).
3.  Lakhpati Didis are SHG members who earn an annual household income of at least Rs. 50,000.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct, the target is three crore Lakhpati Didis,  but there's no specific year mentioned in the provided text.  The program aims to significantly increase the number of women achieving high annual incomes through SHG participation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lakhpati Didi initiative indeed offers crucial financial assistance, including capitalization support through both the Revolving Fund (RF) and the Community Investment Fund (CIF).  These funds are designed to bolster the financial capacity of SHGs and empower women entrepreneurs.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The annual household income threshold for Lakhpati Didis is Rs. 1 Lakh or more, not Rs. 50,000.  This higher threshold reflects the ambition of the program to significantly improve the economic status of participating women.  The monthly income threshold also exceeding Rs.10,000.


**6. With reference to the  Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency to include communicable diseases with a high risk of wide geographical spread, exceeding national health system response capacities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendments to the IHR 2005 significantly refine the definition of a pandemic emergency, explicitly including communicable diseases with a substantial risk of widespread geographical dissemination and the potential to overwhelm national health systems' response capabilities.  This clearer definition is crucial for timely and effective international collaboration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The amendments establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism, but its purpose is to support *developing* countries, not high-income nations, in addressing the needs and priorities arising from pandemic emergencies.  This focus on equitable resource allocation is a key aspect of the reforms.

Statement 3 is correct. The amendments mandate the creation of National IHR Authorities within each WHO member state. This is intended to improve national-level coordination and response mechanisms, enhancing preparedness and effectiveness in handling public health emergencies.  The establishment of these authorities is a significant step towards strengthening global health security.

2.  The report supports the achievement of SDG 12.3.1(a) which aims to reduce food losses along production and supply chains.
3. The report found that households worldwide wasted less than half a billion meals daily in 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The FWI tracks food waste at the retail and consumer levels (household and food service),  but not explicitly at the production level globally.  The focus is on the later stages of the food supply chain where significant waste occurs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Food Waste Index Report directly supports the achievement of SDG 12.3.1(a), which specifically targets the reduction of food losses throughout production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses.  This alignment highlights the report's contribution to global sustainability goals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report actually found that households across all continents wasted *over* 1 billion meals a day in 2022, a considerably higher figure than stated.  This emphasizes the vast scale of household food waste and its implications for resource sustainability and environmental impact.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2008, not 2006.  It was adopted in 2006, but there's a difference between adoption and entry into force.

Statement 2 is correct.  The UN-CRPD clearly defines persons with disabilities to encompass individuals with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments that, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India *is* a signatory to the UN-CRPD, demonstrating its commitment to upholding the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities.  This signatory status reflects India's adherence to international human rights standards.


**9. With reference to Habitat Rights under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1. Habitat rights are granted only to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) residing in reserved forests.
2. The FRA defines "habitat" as the area comprising the customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.
3. Habitat rights are granted without any consultation with stakeholders involved.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PVTGs are a primary focus, habitat rights under the FRA extend to other primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.  The provision is not limited exclusively to PVTGs or reserved forests.

Statement 2 is correct. The FRA's definition of "habitat" accurately encompasses the customary and other habitats within reserved and protected forests utilized by the specified tribal groups.  This comprehensive definition is key to the effective implementation of habitat rights.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The granting of habitat rights involves a series of consultations with various stakeholders.  This participatory approach ensures that the process is transparent, inclusive, and respects the rights and interests of all concerned parties.  Consultation is a fundamental element of the FRA's implementation.


**1. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, categorized India's hunger level as "serious," with a score significantly lower than the global average.
2.  The report highlights a strong correlation between gender inequality, climate change, and heightened hunger levels globally, with women and girls disproportionately affected.
3. Child wasting and stunting rates in India, as per the GHI 2024, are below the global average, indicating significant improvements in child nutrition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The GHI 2024 did indeed classify India's hunger situation as "serious," and the report was jointly released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. However, the statement incorrectly suggests India's score was significantly *lower* than the global average.  While India's score has improved, it remains above the global average, indicating a more severe hunger situation compared to the global average.

Statement 2 is correct. The GHI report consistently emphasizes the strong links between gender inequality, climate change, and food insecurity.  Women and girls are often more vulnerable to malnutrition and the impacts of climate-related events.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 data for India shows that child wasting and stunting rates remain alarmingly high, significantly above the global average, and not below as stated.  These figures highlight persistent challenges in child nutrition in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the report does rank countries, India's ranking is significantly lower than the top five in South Asia.  The statement misrepresents India's position in the regional ranking.

Statement 2 is correct. The report consistently places Iceland, Finland, and Norway at the top of the GGGI rankings, reflecting their advanced progress towards gender equality.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The report estimates a timeframe for achieving full gender parity, but it is less than 150 years, not more.  The exact figure is subject to slight variation depending on the interpretation of the data and the methodology used in the projection.


**3. With reference to the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, consider the following statements:**

1. The NFSA legally enshrines the right to food as a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution.

3. The NFSA mandates the provision of supplementary nutrition to address micronutrient deficiencies among pregnant women and children under six years of age.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NFSA recognizes the right to food as a *statutory* right, not a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution.  While the right to food is a significant human right, its legal status under the NFSA differs from fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The NFSA is designed to provide subsidized food grains to a large segment of the population, but it uses criteria like income and other factors to exclude those considered economically better-off.  This targeted approach is a key feature of the Act.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NFSA aims to enhance food security, the provision of supplementary nutrition to address micronutrient deficiencies is primarily addressed through other schemes like the POSHAN Abhiyan, not directly under the NFSA's mandate.  The NFSA focuses primarily on providing affordable food grains.

Statement 2 is correct. GAIN's core mission involves fostering public-private partnerships to enhance access to essential nutrients in diets, particularly in regions with high rates of malnutrition.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While GAIN addresses malnutrition, its activities are not primarily focused on direct food aid and emergency relief. Instead, GAIN emphasizes long-term, sustainable solutions through partnerships and capacity building.  The statement misrepresents the nature of GAIN's interventions.

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA's core objective is to address crucial shortcomings in essential services for tribal communities by integrating existing schemes.  The convergence approach leverages resources and expertise across multiple government ministries to achieve holistic development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Abhiyan utilizes funds from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It does not involve the allocation of entirely new, separate funding streams.

Statement 3 is correct. The Abhiyan's scope is vast, encompassing approximately 63,000 villages and benefiting more than 5 crore tribal people.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The GHI 2024 report clearly indicates that a significant number of countries face extremely high levels of hunger, making the achievement of SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) by 2030 highly unlikely.  The alarming statistics underscore the global urgency to address food insecurity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India's GHI score did improve compared to some previous years, it still falls under the "serious" category, not "low," according to the 2024 report.  The report also highlights continued high rates of child wasting and stunting in India.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI report explicitly acknowledges the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change impacts, and heightened hunger. It emphasizes the disproportionate impact on women and girls due to food insecurity and malnutrition, exacerbated by climate-related events.

1.  Habitat rights under the FRA are granted only to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) residing in reserved forests.
2. The Act defines "habitat" to include customary habitat and other habitats within reserved and protected forests, encompassing primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.
3. The granting of habitat rights under the FRA involves mandatory prior consultations with all relevant stakeholders, including government agencies, local communities, and NGOs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PVTGs are eligible for habitat rights, the FRA's provision for habitat rights extends to a broader category of Scheduled Tribes, including primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling STs, not exclusively PVTGs.  The location of the habitat (reserved or protected forests) is relevant but not a limiting factor.

Statement 2 is correct. The FRA's definition of "habitat" is inclusive, covering customary and other habitats within reserved and protected forests, encompassing various forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes. This comprehensive definition aims to ensure the protection of their traditional lands and resources.

Statement 3 is correct.  The FRA mandates a participatory approach to the granting of habitat rights.  Consultations with stakeholders are crucial to ensure that the process is transparent, equitable, and respects the rights and interests of all concerned parties. This participatory mechanism is a key feature of the FRA's implementation.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "Lakhpati Didi" initiative under DAY-NRLM has the ambitious goal of assisting a large number of women SHG members to achieve a significant increase in their household income.  This initiative reflects a focus on economic empowerment of women in rural areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  DAY-NRLM's financial assistance to SHGs is multifaceted. While some components may involve direct cash transfers, the program also provides capitalization support through revolving funds and community investment funds, access to bank loans, and other avenues for financial assistance.  It's not solely reliant on direct cash transfers.

Statement 3 is correct. The VRF, managed at the village level by VOs, acts as a safety net to address various vulnerabilities faced by households and communities. This fund's purpose is to provide financial support in emergencies and situations of need, enhancing community resilience.

Statement 2 is correct. The Navchetana framework aligns with the WHO's nurturing care framework, emphasizing the critical role of responsive caregiving and providing opportunities for early learning in a child's development.  This emphasis on responsive caregiving highlights the importance of caregiver-child interaction.

Statement 3 is correct. The framework offers a detailed set of activities tailored to the developmental stages of children aged 0 to 36 months.  This structured approach aims to ensure holistic stimulation across various developmental domains.  This detailed activity plan is a key feature of the Navchetana framework.


**1. With reference to health expenditure in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare as a percentage of total health expenditure decreased between 2017-18 and 2021-22.
2.  Government health expenditure as a percentage of total health expenditure increased during the same period.
3.  Social security expenditure on health, as a percentage of total health expenditure, remained constant between 2017-18 and 2021-22.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare (OOPE) as a percentage of total health expenditure (THE) decreased from 48.8% to 39.4% between 2017-18 and 2021-22. This reflects a shift towards increased coverage from other sources.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text indicates that government health expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of THE increased from 40.8% to 48% during the same period.  This signifies a greater government role in healthcare financing.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The data clearly shows that social security expenditure (SSE) on health, as a percentage of THE, decreased from 9.0% to 8.7% between 2017-18 and 2021-22.  Therefore, it did not remain constant.  The decrease might be attributed to various factors, including shifts in government policies or changes in the delivery of healthcare services. The slight decrease, while seemingly minor, indicates a trend worth noting in the context of overall healthcare financing.


**2. With reference to Passive Euthanasia in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Karnataka is the first state in India to legally permit passive euthanasia for terminally ill patients.
2.  The draft guidelines released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare mandate the involvement of a single medical professional in the decision-making process for withdrawing life support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Karnataka is the *second* state (after Kerala) to allow passive euthanasia, following Supreme Court directives.  This highlights the evolving legal landscape surrounding end-of-life care in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The guidelines stipulate the constitution of a Primary Medical Board (PMB) and a Secondary Medical Board (SMB), each comprising at least three members.  This multi-professional approach underscores the importance of a thorough and considered evaluation before withdrawing life support.  A single physician's decision would not suffice under these guidelines.

Statement 3 is correct. The draft guidelines specifically mention the need to comply with the procedures outlined by the Supreme Court in the *Common Cause vs. Union of India & Anr.* case. This reinforces the legal basis for the guidelines and the importance of adhering to established legal precedents.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport is a legally binding international treaty, not a non-binding agreement.  Its aim is to create a level playing field by harmonizing anti-doping rules internationally.

Statement 3 is correct. The provided text accurately describes NADA's status, function, and alignment with the World Anti-Doping Code 2021.  Its role in implementing the anti-doping program in India is crucial for ensuring fair play in sports.


**5. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by focusing solely on providing financial assistance.
2.  The scheme includes initiatives to promote tribal homestays and establish Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendments, as described, define a pandemic emergency based on both the geographical spread and the capacity of national health systems to respond.  The high risk of further spread is a key component of the definition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism *and* also create National IHR Authorities to improve coordination among countries. The statement omits the crucial aspect of improved inter-country coordination.

3.  The Supreme Court's decision to permit abortion beyond 24 weeks for a 14-year-old rape survivor sets a legal precedent that overrides the provisions of the MTP Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, allows abortion beyond 24 weeks based on the advice of a Medical Board constituted by States/UTs, and it is not limited to cases of rape.  The grounds are broader than just rape.

Statement 2 is correct.  The amended Act, as indicated, requires the opinion of one RMP for abortions up to 20 weeks of gestation.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The Supreme Court's decision highlights the Court's power to interpret and apply laws in individual cases, but it does not necessarily override the MTP Act's provisions entirely.  The decision shows flexibility within the existing legal framework in exceptional circumstances.  The Supreme Court's use of Article 142 doesn't automatically change the law for all cases.



**9. With reference to the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act prohibits surrogacy involving donor gametes (egg or sperm) under any circumstances.
2.  The Act establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) to review and monitor the implementation of the Act.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, amended the original Act to allow surrogacy with donor gametes under specific conditions of medical necessity and with certain restrictions like at least one gamete being from the couple.  The initial text only stated the 2022 rules, which prohibited the use of donor gametes.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act does establish the NARTSB to oversee the implementation and ethical practice of ART services.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The amended rules allow single women (widows or divorcees) to undergo surrogacy under specific conditions, thereby expanding access beyond married couples.  The original text does not mention this.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD):**

1. The UN-CRPD was adopted in Geneva in 2007 and entered into force in 2009.
2. The convention's objective is to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, while promoting respect for their inherent dignity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the UN-CRPD's core objective. The convention aims to create a world where people with disabilities have the same opportunities and rights as everyone else.  It emphasizes respect for their inherent dignity and promotes their full and equal participation in society.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD was adopted in New York in 2006, not Geneva in 2007, and entered into force in 2008, not 2009.  The dates are crucial details often tested in UPSC exams.

Statement 3 is also incorrect. The UN-CRPD's definition of disability encompasses those with long-term impairments, but it doesn't exclude individuals with temporary disabilities.  The focus is on the impact of the impairment on the individual's ability to participate fully in society.  A temporary disability can still significantly affect someone's rights and freedoms.  The UPSC often tests the nuances of such definitions.  The key is the *long-term* nature of the impairment as a defining factor, not the temporal aspect.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct; India has indeed signed and ratified the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport.  This demonstrates an understanding of India's commitment to international anti-doping efforts.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The convention was adopted in 2005 in Paris, not 2003 in Geneva. The location and year are important details that test precise knowledge.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the Convention is a significant international treaty in this area, it hasn't been ratified by all UN member states.  The UPSC often tests knowledge of the extent of international agreements' reach.  Knowing that not all countries have ratified it shows a deeper level of understanding.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project NAMAN is an initiative of the Indian Army, not the Indian Navy.  Distinguishing between different branches of the armed forces is a common detail tested by UPSC.

The other two statements are correct, showcasing an understanding of the project's implementation strategy and its goal of improving service access for defence pensioners and veterans.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005:**

1.  The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a "wide geographical spread" or a high risk thereof, exceeding or potentially exceeding national health systems' response capabilities.

This requires careful attention to detail.


**1. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, indicates that hunger levels in 42 countries are at alarming levels, jeopardizing the "Zero Hunger" goal by 2030.
2.  India's GHI score in 2024 improved to 27.3, placing it in the "serious" category, significantly better than its score in 2023.
3. The global GHI score is consistently below 20, suggesting that global hunger is under control and near eradication.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The GHI 2024 report highlighted the alarming hunger levels in numerous countries, making the achievement of "Zero Hunger" by 2030 appear increasingly unlikely.  This underscores the persistent challenge of global food insecurity and the need for intensified efforts to address its root causes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's ranking did improve compared to the previous year, the statement misrepresents the severity of the situation.  The GHI score of 27.3 still places India firmly in the "serious" category, indicating a substantial portion of the population faces significant hunger issues.  The statement incorrectly suggests a substantial improvement in India's hunger situation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The global GHI score is not consistently below 20 and is above that threshold in the 2024 report, indicating a moderate level of hunger severity globally.  The statement presents a misleadingly optimistic assessment of the global hunger situation, downplaying the scale of the problem.  A score below 20 would indeed suggest a controlled situation, however, this is not the case, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and intervention.

Statement 1 is correct. The Dhebar Committee's recommendations indeed led to the recognition of 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one UT, with Odisha having the highest number.  This is a well-established fact in the context of Indian tribal demographics.

Statement 2 is also correct. The listed criteria accurately reflect the parameters used to identify PVTGs.  These criteria highlight the unique vulnerabilities and socio-economic characteristics of these groups.  Note that while the provided text doesn't explicitly state the year the criteria were established, the year 1993 is a plausible and commonly associated year for the formalization of these criteria, and it doesn't affect the validity of the statement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme does aim for comprehensive socio-economic development and cultural preservation,  it's inaccurate to state that it *exclusively* focuses on financial assistance. The scheme encompasses a broader range of interventions, including educational initiatives, infrastructure development, and livelihood support programs, beyond just financial aid.


**2. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines 'habitat' as encompassing customary habitat and other habitats within reserved and protected forests specifically for primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes (STs), excluding any other communities.
2.  Habitat rights under the FRA are granted only after extensive consultations with all relevant stakeholders, including non-tribal communities that may have interests in the same forest area.
3. The FRA mandates the establishment of Gram Sabhas to oversee the implementation of habitat rights, ensuring that all decisions related to forest resource management are made in consultation with the local communities, including non-tribal residents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FRA does define 'habitat' in the manner described, it’s inaccurate to state that it *exclusively* applies to primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes. The act encompasses a broader range of forest-dwelling communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While consultations are a crucial part of the FRA's implementation, the statement overstates the extent of stakeholder involvement. The focus of consultations is primarily on the forest-dwelling communities who are seeking habitat rights.  The inclusion of non-tribal communities in every instance is not mandatory.

Statement 3 is also incorrect. While Gram Sabhas play a vital role in the implementation of FRA, the statement incorrectly asserts that *all* decisions are made in consultation with non-tribal residents. The primary focus remains on the rights and needs of the forest-dwelling communities recognized under the FRA.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

2.  The scheme's funding is entirely drawn from newly allocated funds specifically designated for PM-JUGA, ensuring its distinct and independent financial support and avoiding any dependence on existing schemes.
3. PM-JUGA's key component is the establishment of 1000 Tribal Home Stays, aiming to significantly boost tourism in tribal areas and improve the economic condition of tribal communities by promoting tourism-related employment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PM-JUGA does aim to address critical gaps and learn from PM-JANMAN, the claim of eliminating all tribal poverty within five years is an overstatement and unrealistic.  The scheme aims for significant improvement, but complete poverty eradication within such a short timeframe is improbable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The scheme's funding is drawn from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.  It does not have a separate, entirely new funding source.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the promotion of Tribal Home Stays is a component of PM-JUGA, it's not the *key* component, and the specific number of 1000 is an oversimplification of a larger, more nuanced initiative involving multiple interventions to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  The focus is broader than just tourism.


**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, indicated that hunger levels in 42 countries are at alarming levels, rendering the 2030 Zero Hunger goal unattainable, while India's GHI score improved significantly, moving out of the "serious" category.
2.  The report highlighted a strong correlation between gender inequality and climate change, and hunger, revealing that women and girls are disproportionately affected by food insecurity and malnutrition due to climate change, with India showing a significant reduction in child wasting and stunting.

3. The GHI report highlights a strong correlation between gender inequality, climate change, and heightened hunger levels globally, particularly impacting women and girls disproportionately.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key findings from the GHI 2024 report.  Statement 1 correctly points out the alarming hunger levels in numerous countries and the consequent threat to the 2030 Zero Hunger goal.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the FWI Report 2024, its collaborators, its scope (tracking food waste at retail and consumer levels), and its alignment with SDG 12.3.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the report does highlight significant household food waste and the contribution of food waste to greenhouse gas emissions, the figure of 500 million meals wasted daily is an underestimation; the actual figure is over 1 billion. The percentage contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is also slightly off; it is closer to 8-10%.  Statement 3 is entirely accurate in describing the two SDG 12.3.1 indicators, their respective focuses (FLI on production and supply chain losses, FWI on retail and consumer waste), and the custodian organizations (FAO for FLI, UNEP for FWI).  Because of the inaccuracies in Statement 2, only Statements 1 and 3 are completely accurate, making option (b) the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include Statement 2, which contains factual errors.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IHR (2005) is indeed a successor to the International Sanitary Regulations, aiming to create a legally binding framework for global public health emergencies.  The focus is on countries' rights and obligations in managing such events, especially those with the potential to cross borders.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The 77th WHA did introduce amendments to the IHR (2005) to enhance global pandemic preparedness and response. A key element of these amendments was addressing the needs of developing countries, including creating a financial mechanism to support their efforts. This highlights a crucial aspect of global health governance – recognizing and addressing inequalities in health infrastructure and capacity.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that the IHR (2005) comprises all 194 WHO Member States, *including* Liechtenstein and the Holy See.  Therefore, they are members and are bound by the regulations. This underscores the inclusive nature of the IHR's reach, aiming for global cooperation in public health.  The inclusion of even smaller states reflects the understanding that public health threats do not respect national borders.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The amendments *do* include provisions for creating National IHR Authorities. This is a crucial aspect of strengthening national capacities and improving coordination within countries, a key element of effective pandemic response.

Statement 3 is correct.  The creation of a coordinating financial mechanism is a key feature of the amendments, directly addressing the resource constraints faced by many developing countries in pandemic preparedness and response. This highlights the commitment to equitable global health security.


**5. With reference to Passive Euthanasia in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The recently released draft guidelines for passive euthanasia in India define terminal illness and delineate conditions for withdrawing life-sustaining treatments (LST), adhering to Supreme Court directives in the Common Cause vs. Union of India case.
2. The guidelines mandate the constitution of a Primary Medical Board (PMB) and a Secondary Medical Board (SMB), both comprising at least three members, to review requests for withdrawing LST, with the SMB validating the PMB's decision.
3.  Karnataka is the only state in India to have legally allowed passive euthanasia for terminally ill patients, reflecting the Supreme Court's interpretation of the right to die with dignity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The draft guidelines released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare do aim to define terminal illness and the conditions for withdrawing LST, aligning with Supreme Court precedents.  This provides a framework for a complex and sensitive issue.

Statement 2 is also correct. The establishment of PMB and SMB, with their specified composition and roles, is a crucial part of the proposed process, ensuring a multi-faceted review of requests for withdrawing LST. This adds layers of checks and balances to the decision-making process.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage mentions that *both* Karnataka and Kerala have allowed passive euthanasia for terminally ill patients, aligning with Supreme Court directives. This indicates a growing acceptance of this sensitive issue within the legal framework.


**1. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with only a "wide geographical spread," regardless of its impact on national health systems.
2.  A new States Parties Committee is established to ensure effective IHR implementation, replacing existing national authorities.
3. The amendments primarily focus on strengthening surveillance mechanisms in developed countries, while providing limited financial support to developing nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 incorrectly simplifies the definition of a pandemic emergency in the IHR amendments. While "wide geographical spread" is a factor, the amendments also emphasize exceeding or potentially exceeding the capacity of national health systems to respond. Statement 2 is inaccurate because the amendments establish a States Parties Committee *in addition* to creating National IHR Authorities, not as a replacement.  These bodies work in conjunction for improved international and national coordination.  Statement 3 misrepresents the focus of the amendments.  While surveillance is a key component, the amendments also explicitly establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to address the needs of developing countries, demonstrating a commitment to global equity in pandemic preparedness and response.  The amendments aim for a more comprehensive approach to international health emergencies, recognizing the interconnectedness of global health security.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure for tribal communities over a 10-year period, focusing primarily on healthcare and education.
2.  The scheme utilizes funds exclusively from newly allocated budgetary provisions, separate from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.
3.  A key component of PM-JUGA involves promoting tribal home stays through the Ministry of Tourism, aiming to boost rural tourism and create sustainable livelihoods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because PM-JUGA's timeframe is 5 years (2024-2029), not 10, and while healthcare and education are crucial components, the scheme addresses broader socio-economic development including infrastructure, livelihood, and skill development. Statement 2 is wrong; PM-JUGA leverages existing DAPST grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It does not introduce entirely new funding streams.  Statement 3 accurately reflects a key component of PM-JUGA – promoting tribal home stays under Swadesh Darshan to leverage tourism potential for improved livelihoods.  The other interventions mentioned in the passage, such as infrastructure improvements and skill development initiatives, further highlight the scheme's multi-faceted approach.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024 indicates that India's child wasting rate is below the global average, reflecting improvements in nutrition programs.
2.  The report highlights a strong correlation between gender inequality and hunger, with women and girls disproportionately affected by food insecurity.
3.  India's improved GHI ranking in 2024 signifies that the country is on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 of Zero Hunger by 2030.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 report shows that child wasting in India remains very high (over 18.7%), contradicting the claim of it being below the global average.  Statement 2 is accurate; the report explicitly links gender inequality to higher rates of hunger and malnutrition, emphasizing the vulnerability of women and girls to food insecurity and the impacts of climate change.  Statement 3 is false; while India's GHI ranking improved, the report indicates that global hunger levels are alarming and make achieving Zero Hunger by 2030 unattainable. India's improvement does not indicate the country is on track to meet this global SDG. The report underscores the need for continued and strengthened efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition worldwide.


**4. With reference to Passive Euthanasia guidelines released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, consider the following statements:**

1. The guidelines define terminal illness solely based on the prognosis of less than six months of life expectancy.
2.  A Secondary Medical Board (SMB) is mandated to independently review and approve all decisions made by the Primary Medical Board (PMB) regarding withdrawal of life support.
3.  The guidelines explicitly incorporate provisions for active euthanasia, allowing for the administration of lethal substances by physicians under specific conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct.  Statement 1 is inaccurate because the guidelines don't solely rely on a six-month life expectancy; the definition of terminal illness is more nuanced, encompassing irreversible conditions and suffering.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while the SMB validates the PMB's decision, it doesn't independently approve it; the SMB's role is to provide a second opinion and ensure the process is followed correctly. Statement 3 is completely false; the guidelines explicitly address *passive* euthanasia (withdrawal of life support), not active euthanasia (administering lethal substances),  reflecting a legal and ethical framework that respects the sanctity of life while acknowledging the right to a dignified death for terminally ill patients in specific circumstances. The guidelines adhere to Supreme Court directives and emphasize the necessity of multiple medical opinions and ethical review.


**5. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates for 2020-21 and 2021-22, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHA estimates indicate a significant increase in Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on health as a percentage of Total Health Expenditure (THE) during this period.
2. Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) as a percentage of THE showed a considerable decline, reflecting a shift towards public health insurance schemes.
3. The estimates reveal a substantial decrease in external/donor funding for health as a percentage of THE, suggesting reduced reliance on international aid.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is false; the NHA estimates show a slight *decrease* in SSE on health as a percentage of THE. Statement 2 is also incorrect; PHIE showed a *significant increase* as a percentage of THE, indicating a growth in private health insurance despite the existence of public schemes.  Statement 3 is inaccurate because external/donor funding for health as a percentage of THE actually *increased*, not decreased, highlighting a rise in international aid for the health sector. The NHA estimates provide a complex picture of India's health financing landscape, illustrating the interplay between public and private spending and the role of international assistance.  The data reveals trends and shifts in health financing that require deeper analysis to understand the implications for healthcare access and affordability.


**1. Consider the following statements about Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  The Dhebar Committee (1960-61) recommended the recognition of 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory, with Odisha having the highest number.
2.  Criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural existence, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy.
3.  The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme aims for comprehensive socio-economic development while preserving their culture and heritage, with 100% central funding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of PVTGs and related government schemes.  The Dhebar Committee's recommendations formed the basis for identifying PVTGs, and Odisha indeed houses the largest number of recognized PVTGs. The criteria listed in statement 2 are indeed key factors considered in identifying a group as PVTG.  Statement 3 correctly describes the aims and funding mechanism of the "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one true statement.


**2. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FRA defines "habitat" as the area encompassing the customary habitat and other habitats within reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.
2.  Habitat rights are granted after a series of consultations with relevant stakeholders, including the tribes themselves.
3.  The FRA mandates that only those tribes residing in protected forests for at least 50 years are eligible for habitat rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the FRA's definition of habitat. Statement 2 is also correct; the FRA emphasizes stakeholder consultation before granting habitat rights.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The FRA doesn't stipulate a minimum 50-year residency requirement for habitat rights.  Eligibility is determined by customary rights and historical presence, not a fixed time period.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude true statements or include a false one.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while PM-JUGA aims to address social infrastructure gaps, the timeframe mentioned is not explicitly stated in the provided text. Statement 2 is incorrect; the scheme utilizes existing funds from the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST).  Statement 3 is correct; tribal homestays and school infrastructure improvement are indeed components of PM-JUGA.  Therefore, only statement 3 is completely accurate, making option (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of inaccurate statements.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the GHI 2024 report does highlight alarming hunger levels in numerous countries. Statement 3 accurately reflects the report's findings on the links between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; while India's ranking improved, it remained in the "serious" category, not "low."  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include false statements or omit true ones.


**5. Consider the following statements about Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs.
2.  The Supreme Court's ruling in the Sukanya Santha case challenged the practice of assigning jobs in prisons based on caste.

Statement 2 is also correct; the regulations clearly stipulate that FHEIs must be ranked within the global top 500 to be eligible. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The regulations explicitly allow for collaborations between two or more FHEIs, provided each meets the eligibility criteria individually. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**3. With reference to the National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The NSP 2024 aims to integrate sports with education, aligning with the principles of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.
2. The NSP 2024's vision statement emphasizes leveraging sports to boost only the tourism industry for economic development.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NSP 2024 explicitly aims to harmonize with the NEP 2020, integrating sports and education.  Statement 3 is also correct; the policy indeed proposes a National Fitness Ranking & Indexing system to encourage broader participation. However, statement 2 is incorrect. While the NSP 2024 does aim for economic development through sports, it's not limited solely to tourism; it also intends to leverage sports to boost other industries such as manufacturing.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate reflections of the NSP 2024's key features.

**1. With reference to healthcare financing in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on health, as a percentage of total health expenditure (THE), has consistently increased over the past decade.
2. Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) constitute a smaller portion of THE compared to SSE.
3. External/donor funding for health has remained static as a percentage of THE in recent years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) as a percentage of THE *increased* to 7.4% from 5.8%, while Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on health *decreased* to 8.7% from 9.0%.  This directly contradicts statement 1 and shows that PHIE constitutes a larger portion of THE than previously, refuting statement 2.  Furthermore, external/donor funding increased to 1.1% from 0.5%, demonstrating a significant rise and invalidating statement 3.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the data presented. The question plays on the tendency to assume consistent growth in healthcare spending across all sectors, a common misconception in policy analysis. The options are designed to test the candidate's ability to critically evaluate numerical data and avoid making assumptions based on general trends.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court of India has, in fact, recognized the legality of passive euthanasia in several landmark judgments, notably the Aruna Shanbaug case and the Common Cause case.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; the text mentions both Karnataka and Kerala as states allowing passive euthanasia.  Finally, statement 3 is false. The guidelines released by the Ministry focus solely on passive euthanasia (withdrawal of life support), not active euthanasia (deliberate ending of life).  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the nuanced legal landscape surrounding euthanasia in India, highlighting the distinction between passive and active euthanasia and the evolving judicial interpretations.  The distractors are designed to trap candidates who may have a general understanding of the topic but lack precise knowledge of the legal precedents.



**3. With reference to the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the text clearly states that the GRFC is produced *annually*, not biennially. Statement 2 is also incorrect on two counts: the GNAFC was launched in 2016, not 2010, and it involved the European Union and the World Food Programme (WFP) in addition to the FAO. Statement 3 misrepresents the GRFC's focus. While economic factors are relevant, the report's core aim is to address the *root causes* of food crises, encompassing humanitarian, political, and environmental dimensions beyond mere economic impact.  The question is designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of the GNAFC and GRFC, emphasizing the need for precise factual recall. The incorrect options utilize plausible but ultimately inaccurate details, making them effective distractors for candidates who may have a general understanding of food security issues but lack the specific information regarding the GRFC and GNAFC.

3. The report estimates that food waste contributes to a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report explicitly states that it tracks food waste at both retail and consumer levels. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the UNEP (UN Environment Programme), in collaboration with WRAP, is responsible for the FWI, not the FAO.  The FAO is associated with the Food Loss Index (FLI), a separate indicator. However, statement 3 is correct. The report does estimate that food waste contributes to 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The question focuses on the details of the Food Waste Index Report 2024, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar concepts (FLI and FWI) and correctly identify the custodians of these indices.  The incorrect options present plausible but ultimately wrong information, making them strong distractors for those with incomplete knowledge of the report's specifics.


**5. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency solely based on the mortality rate of a communicable disease.
2. The amendments establish a new global health authority independent of the World Health Organization (WHO).
3. The amendments aim to improve coordination among countries in handling public health emergencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments define a pandemic emergency based on "wide geographical spread" or high risk thereof, and its impact on national health systems' response capacity, not solely on mortality rates.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The amendments strengthen the existing WHO framework but do not create a new independent global health authority.  Statement 3, however, accurately reflects the core objective of the amendments: to enhance international coordination and collaboration in managing public health crises.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the IHR amendments, focusing on the specifics of the changes and avoiding generalizations.  The incorrect options provide plausible but inaccurate details, thereby testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar concepts and identify the precise aims of the amendments.


**6. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and its amendments, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a child as a person below the age of 16 years.
2. The 2021 amendment introduced provisions for trying children aged 16-18 as adults only for non-heinous offenses.
3. The Act mandates the registration of all Child Care Institutions (CCIs), regardless of funding sources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the 2015 Act, not the 2021 amendment, introduced the provision for trying 16-18-year-olds as adults for heinous offenses. The 2021 amendment primarily focused on adoption procedures and court designations.  However, statement 3 is correct, reflecting the Act's requirement for mandatory registration of all CCIs, regardless of whether they receive government funding. This question delves into the specifics of the Juvenile Justice Act, testing recall of precise age definitions and the scope of amendments.  The incorrect options contain plausible but inaccurate details related to age definitions and the focus of amendments, serving as effective distractors.


**7. With reference to the Model Foster Care Guidelines, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The guidelines are primarily concerned with institutional care for children.
2. The guidelines are not aligned with the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.
3. The guidelines aim to promote alternative care options for children.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The guidelines are focused on foster care, which is an alternative care approach, not institutional care. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The guidelines are explicitly stated to be in consonance with the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, and other related legislation.  However, statement 3 is correct. The overarching aim of the Model Foster Care Guidelines is to promote foster care as a viable alternative care option for children in need of protection. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Model Foster Care Guidelines and their alignment with existing laws.  The incorrect options present misleading information about the nature of the guidelines and their relationship to the Juvenile Justice Act, making them effective distractors for candidates with incomplete knowledge.


**8. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act provides for both civil and criminal remedies for marital rape.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act only provides for civil remedies; it does not address marital rape as a criminal offense. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The definition of "aggrieved person" is broader, encompassing any woman in a domestic relationship with the abuser and their relatives. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, addresses domestic violence, it does not represent an amendment to the 2005 Act.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.  The incorrect options present misleading information about the scope of remedies, the definition of key terms, and the relationship to other legislation, serving as effective distractors for those with incomplete knowledge.


**9. With reference to abortion laws in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, allows abortion only up to 12 weeks of gestation.
2. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, removed all gestational limits for abortion.
3.  The Supreme Court has the power to make exceptions to the gestational limits set by the MTP Act, under certain circumstances.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The original MTP Act had a 20-week limit, and the 2021 amendment extended this further. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The 2021 amendment extended the gestational limits, but it did not remove them entirely.  However, statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court, utilizing its powers under Article 142, can make exceptions to the gestational limits in exceptional cases, as demonstrated by the case mentioned in the text. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the legal framework around abortion in India, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of gestational limits and the Supreme Court's role.  The incorrect options utilize plausible but ultimately inaccurate information about gestational limits and the scope of the amendments, serving as effective distractors.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NADA was initially set up as a registered society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860 in 2005. It later became a statutory body with the enactment of the National Anti-Doping Act, 2022, but its original establishment predates the Act. The timeline and legal basis of NADA's formation are distinct.

Statement 2 is correct.  PEADS and the MoU with SARADO are both accurate examples of NADA's initiatives to promote education and awareness and foster regional cooperation in anti-doping efforts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, deals with narcotics and psychotropic substances, not specifically with the anti-doping program in sports, which has its own dedicated legislation and agencies.  The question attempts to link unrelated legal frameworks.

(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court has recognized the legality of passive euthanasia under specific conditions and guidelines, not a complete ban.  The legal status is more complex than simply a blanket prohibition.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Ministry has indeed released draft guidelines, reflecting the ongoing efforts to regulate passive euthanasia.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Karnataka and Kerala have made provisions for passive euthanasia based on Supreme Court directives, other states may also have implemented similar measures or are in the process of doing so.  The number of states is not limited to just two.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GAIN report was launched by GAIN itself, not the WFP. This tests knowledge of the organization behind the report.  The question uses a distractor by giving a very closely related organization.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities, leveraging existing schemes.
2.  The scheme's funding is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds specifically for this initiative.
3. PM-JUGA's coverage encompasses approximately 63,000 villages, benefiting over 5 crore tribal people, with a 10-year tenure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. PM-JUGA's core objective is to address crucial shortcomings in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities by strategically integrating and expanding existing schemes.  The initiative aims for comprehensive development, not just the creation of new programs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The scheme's funding is drawn from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  No new, dedicated funding is created solely for PM-JUGA. This leverages pre-existing resources for efficient implementation.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect regarding the tenure. While the number of villages and beneficiaries is accurate, the scheme's tenure is 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29), not 10.  This detail is crucial for understanding the scheme's timeframe and planning cycles.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural existence, a rapidly growing population, high literacy rates, and a robust market economy.
2. Odisha has the lowest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and Union Territories.
3.  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is a state-sponsored initiative with partial central funding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The characteristics of PVTGs actually include a *stagnant or declining* population, *extremely low* literacy rates, and a *subsistence* economy, indicating vulnerability and limited access to resources and opportunities.  The statement inverts these key indicators of PVTG status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, the highest number among all states and UTs, highlighting its significant PVTG population.  The statement directly contradicts this established fact.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is a *centrally sponsored scheme* with 100% central assistance in the form of funding (Grant-in-Aid and Creation of Capital Assets).  It is not state-sponsored nor does it involve partial central funding.


**3. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Food Waste Index (FWI) tracks global and national food waste generation at the production level and consumer levels.
2. The FWI supports the goals of SDG 12.3.1 (a) and 12.3.1 (b), with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as the custodian of both indicators.
3.  The report found that in 2022, households across all continents wasted less than 500 million meals per day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The FWI does indeed track global and national food waste generation, but it focuses specifically on waste at the retail and consumer levels (household and food service), not at the production level. The focus is on downstream waste, not upstream losses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the FWI does support the goals of SDG 12.3.1 (b),  the FAO is the custodian of SDG 12.3.1 (a) (Food Loss Index - FLI), while UNEP is the custodian of SDG 12.3.1 (b) (FWI). The statement incorrectly attributes custodianship to the FAO for both indicators.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report actually found that households wasted *over 1 billion* meals a day in 2022, showcasing the significant scale of global food waste at the household level.  The statement provides a drastically underestimated figure.

3. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central funding, focusing on comprehensive socio-economic development while preserving cultural heritage, and utilizes a micro-plan approach through Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Dhebar Committee recommended recognizing 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory, not 17. Odisha does indeed house the highest number of PVTGs among all states and UTs.

Statement 2 is correct.  The listed criteria accurately reflect the parameters used to identify PVTGs, highlighting their unique vulnerabilities and dependence on traditional ways of life.

Statement 3 is correct. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is indeed centrally sponsored with 100% central funding, aiming for holistic development while respecting cultural identity. The use of CCD plans for micro-level planning is also a key feature.


**2. With reference to Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines 'habitat' as encompassing customary habitats and other habitats within reserved and protected forests specifically for primitive tribal groups and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.
2.  The allocation of habitat rights involves a multi-stage consultation process with relevant stakeholders, but this process is not legally mandated and can be ignored in certain situations.
3.  Tribes recognized for habitat rights include the Paudi Bhuyans of Odisha, the Bharias of Madhya Pradesh, and the Maria Gond of Maharashtra, but excludes the Kamars and Baigas of Chhattisgarh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only

1. The FWI Report, a collaboration between UNEP and WRAP, tracks global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels, supporting SDG 12.3 indicators, specifically SDG 12.3.1 (b), which aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030.  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of SDG 12.3.1 (a), which focuses on reducing food losses along production and supply chains.
2. The report found that households globally wasted over 1 billion meals daily in 2022, and food waste contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for approximately 15-20% of global emissions.
3. The FWI Report is released annually, providing up-to-date data on food waste trends and their environmental and economic implications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  It accurately describes the FWI Report's scope, its alignment with SDG 12.3, and the respective roles of UNEP and FAO.

Statement 2 is partially correct but needs correction. The report does indeed state that households wasted over 1 billion meals daily in 2022, but the contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is estimated at 8-10%, not 15-20%.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report is not necessarily released annually, the frequency may vary.





**1. With reference to global gender inequality, consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024, released by the World Economic Forum (WEF), indicates that 68.5% of the global gender gap has been closed.
2.  India's rank in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Report is lower than its rank in the 2023 report.
3.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, published by the UNDP, ranks Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland among the top three countries with the least gender inequality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the WEF's Global Gender Gap Report does track progress towards gender parity, the exact percentage of the gender gap closed varies year to year and the figure of 68.5% is not accurate for the 2024 report. The report presents a complex picture, showing progress in some areas and stagnation or regression in others.  It doesn't present a single percentage figure summarizing the overall gap closure.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's ranking in the Global Gender Gap Report fluctuates, but consistently places it relatively low compared to other nations.  The provided text confirms a decline in India's rank from 2023 to 2024.

Statement 3 is correct.  The UNDP's Gender Inequality Index (GII) consistently ranks Scandinavian countries among the top performers in terms of gender equality. The statement accurately reflects the GII 2022 findings.  The GII uses a different methodology than the WEF's report, leading to different rankings, but both reports broadly agree on the relative positions of the highest-ranking countries.  The GII's focus on reproductive health, empowerment, and economic participation provides a different lens on gender inequality than the WEF's broader approach.


**2. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NIRF indeed utilizes the five mentioned parameters for ranking educational institutions, and the integration of "Innovation" is a recent addition reflecting the importance of innovation in higher education.

Statement 2 is partially correct. IISc Bangalore consistently tops the NIRF University category. However, while it is a highly ranked Indian university, stating it consistently ranks among the top globally according to both NIRF and THE rankings is an overstatement.  The NIRF is a national ranking, and global rankings like THE place IISc in a high, but not necessarily top, global bracket.  The rankings are based on different criteria and methodologies, leading to different outcomes.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NBA, in collaboration with INFLIBNET Centre, is the implementing agency for NIRF. The NBA's role in assessing the quality of programs aligns with the overall goal of NIRF to improve and evaluate educational quality.

**1. With reference to euthanasia, consider the following statements:**

1.  Passive euthanasia, involving the withholding of life-sustaining treatment, was legally recognized in India following the Aruna Shanbaug case.
2.  The Supreme Court of India, in 2018, clarified that the right to die with dignity is not a fundamental right under Article 21.
3.  Active euthanasia, which involves the deliberate act of ending a life, is legally permissible in India under specific circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Aruna Shanbaug case (2011) was a landmark judgment where the Supreme Court of India recognized the legality of passive euthanasia under strict guidelines, linking it to the right to die with dignity and the fundamental right to life (Article 21).  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court did indeed recognize the right to die with dignity in the Common Cause vs. Union of India & Anr. (2018) case, affirming the legal validity of passive euthanasia.  This right is implicitly linked to Article 21, although not explicitly stated as a separate fundamental right. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Active euthanasia, the deliberate act of ending a life, remains illegal in India.  The legal framework focuses on passive euthanasia, allowing for the withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining treatment under very specific, stringent conditions and with judicial oversight.  The focus is on ensuring the patient's dignity and minimizing suffering while respecting the sanctity of life.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, indicates that hunger levels in over 50 countries are at alarming levels.
2.  India's GHI score in 2024 improved compared to 2023, placing it in the "moderate" category of hunger severity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the GHI 2024 does indeed highlight alarming hunger levels in many countries, the number is closer to 42, not over 50.  Statement 2 is incorrect. India's ranking improved in 2024 compared to 2023, but it remained in the "serious" category, not "moderate," according to the report. The report indicates that a significant portion of India's population suffers from undernourishment, and child wasting and stunting remain high. Statement 3 is correct. The GHI report strongly emphasizes the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, pointing out the disproportionate impact on women and girls due to food insecurity, malnutrition, and the effects of extreme weather events and climate emergencies. The report underscores the need for addressing these interconnected factors to effectively tackle global hunger.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While many DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, not all nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs.  The DNT categorization is based on a specific historical context of being labeled "criminal tribes" during British rule, a designation that doesn't encompass all nomadic groups.  Many nomadic communities have distinct identities and histories separate from the DNT classification.

Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a discriminatory law that labeled certain communities as inherently criminal, was indeed repealed. However, the repeal happened in 1949, not 1952, after which these communities were denotified in 1952.  This repeal marked a significant step towards rectifying historical injustices and acknowledging the diverse livelihoods and social structures of these communities.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Idate Commission (2017) actually recommended the immediate repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act by respective states. The commission recognized that this act often leads to harassment and discrimination against members of DNTs, perpetuating cycles of marginalization and hindering their social and economic advancement.  The commission advocated for alternative approaches to address crime that do not rely on discriminatory and outdated legislation.

The 2024 NIRF rankings incorporated a new "Innovation" ranking, and IISc Bangalore topped the Universities category for the ninth consecutive time, with Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore being the top-ranked Indian university in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The addition of new ranking categories and IIT Madras's top ranking are accurate. Statement 2 is also correct. It accurately describes NIRF's parameters and implementing agency. Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While IISc Bangalore did top the Universities category, the statement incorrectly attributes the top THE ranking to IISc Bangalore in 2025.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are fully correct, making option (a) the most appropriate answer.  The question assesses the examinee's knowledge of the NIRF ranking framework and its details, including its recent updates.  It also tests the ability to identify inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements.


**1. With reference to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The report defines financing for food security and nutrition as encompassing only public financial resources directed towards eradicating hunger.
2.  The report indicates that the world is on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, Zero Hunger, by 2030.
3. The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) was established in 2016 by the European Union, the FAO, and the WFP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report's definition of financing for food security and nutrition explicitly includes both public and private financial resources, both domestic and foreign.  It's a comprehensive definition encompassing various sources and aiming for a multi-faceted approach.  Focusing only on public resources is a significant oversimplification of the report's approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report explicitly states that the world is far off track in achieving SDG 2, Zero Hunger.  The data presented in the report highlights a significant gap between the current situation and the goal, indicating substantial challenges remain to eliminate hunger globally.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) was indeed launched in 2016 by a partnership of the European Union, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the World Food Programme (WFP) during the World Humanitarian Summit.  This collaboration represents a significant effort to address the root causes of food crises.


**2. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024, launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) and WRAP, tracks food waste at the production level only.
2.  The FWI supports SDG 12.3.1 (a), focusing on reducing food losses along production and supply chains, with the UNEP acting as its custodian.
3. The report found that households globally wasted less than 500 million meals daily in 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FWI Report tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels (household and food service).  While acknowledging the significance of food loss during production, the report's focus is on the later stages of the food supply chain where a substantial amount of waste occurs.  The WHO is not involved in the launch of the report; it's the UNEP and WRAP.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The FWI supports SDG 12.3.1 (b), focusing on halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels.  The custodian of this indicator is the UNEP, not the FAO (which is the custodian of SDG 12.3.1 (a) - Food Loss Index).

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report found that households wasted *over* 1 billion meals a day in 2022, a significantly higher figure than stated. This highlights the scale of the food waste challenge at the consumer level.


**3. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHA Estimates are derived from the National Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2011, and utilize the System of Health Accounts, 2016.
2.  In 2021-22, the total health expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP decreased compared to 2017-18.
3.  The System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 is a global standard framework developed by the OECD, WHO, and Eurostat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHA Estimates are derived from the National Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2016, and utilize the System of Health Accounts, 2011. The years are reversed in the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. In 2021-22, the THE as a percentage of GDP *increased* to 3.83% from 3.31% in 2017-18.  This indicates a rise in the proportion of GDP allocated to healthcare.

Statement 3 is correct. The SHA 2011 is indeed a global standard framework for producing health accounts, facilitating international comparisons.  It was developed through a joint effort by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Health Organization (WHO), and Eurostat.



**4. With reference to the initiatives launched by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the NQAS Assessment is for AAMs and IPHLs and in compliance with IPHS, the IPHS itself is a *digital* platform, not a manual-based system.  The statement misrepresents the nature of the IPHS.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Spot Food License Initiative aims to *simplify and expedite* the licensing and registration processes, not delay them.  The use of a pan-India IT platform (FoSCoS) is designed to streamline this process.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) is a digital platform that allows for real-time monitoring of public health facilities, providing a comprehensive overview of their assessment and compliance status.


**5. With reference to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) report, ‘The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains’, consider the following statements:**

1. The report focuses solely on reducing gender inequalities in the agricultural sector, ignoring other aspects of nutrition.
2. The report promotes nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to enhance business resilience but does not address productivity.
3.  The report highlights how nutrition investments can reduce gender inequalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report's scope is broader than just gender inequality; it also addresses productivity and business resilience within the agri-food sector as key aspects related to improved nutrition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report explicitly promotes nutrition investments to increase productivity and enhance business resilience within the agri-food sector, highlighting these as interconnected goals.

Statement 3 is correct. A central theme of the GAIN report is the demonstration of how strategic nutrition investments in the agri-food sector can contribute to reducing gender inequalities, improving the livelihoods and economic opportunities of women involved in food production and distribution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The government recognizes 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one UT. The number of states and UTs is off by one.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Habitat rights are defined under Section 3(1)(e), not (f), of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006.  A minor detail but crucial for accuracy.

Statement 3 is correct. Odisha indeed has the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and Union Territories.


**9. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Supreme Court's Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others case highlighted caste-based discrimination in prisons, specifically targeting DNTs.
3. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was enacted to provide social and economic support to DNTs.

2.  The scheme is solely funded through newly allocated grants specifically designated for PM-JUGA.
3. PM-JUGA's implementation covers approximately 63,000 villages, benefiting over 5 crore tribal people over a 5-year period (2024-29).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA's core objective is to address critical shortcomings in social infrastructure, healthcare, education, and livelihood opportunities for tribal populations.  It achieves this through the strategic convergence and coordinated implementation of existing schemes, maximizing resource utilization and impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The scheme utilizes existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It does not rely on newly allocated, dedicated funds specifically for PM-JUGA.  This is a key aspect of the scheme’s design, emphasizing efficient resource management.

Statement 3 is correct. The Abhiyan's geographical coverage encompasses approximately 63,000 villages, targeting a substantial population of over 5 crore tribal individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in Brazil, not India.  This detail is crucial for understanding the global context of the initiative and its geographical origins.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While financial mobilization is a component of the Alliance's strategy, its approach is far broader than simply distributing financial aid.  The Alliance acts as a facilitator, building partnerships and mobilizing resources (financial and knowledge-based) to implement various policy instruments. Its focus is on comprehensive solutions, rather than solely on financial assistance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India is explicitly mentioned as a member of the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty. This highlights India's active participation in international efforts to address global challenges related to hunger and poverty.  Therefore, none of the statements are correct.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Food Waste Index Report 2024:**

1. The Food Waste Index (FWI) exclusively tracks food waste at the household level, excluding retail and food service sectors.
2.  The FWI supports SDG 12.3.1 (a), focusing on reducing food losses along production and supply chains, with the Food and Agriculture Organization as its custodian.
3. The report indicates that households globally wasted over 1 billion meals daily in 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FWI Report 2024 explicitly states it tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels (household and food service).  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the index to only household-level waste, neglecting a significant portion of its data collection and analysis.

Statement 2 is correct.  The report directly supports SDG 12.3.1 (a), aiming to reduce food losses across production and supply chains, with the FAO serving as the custodian of this specific indicator.  This correctly identifies the index's alignment with global sustainability goals.

Statement 3 is correct.  A key finding of the report is that households worldwide wasted over 1 billion meals daily in 2022. This highlights the magnitude of the problem and the report's emphasis on consumer-level food waste. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct.

2. The scheme exclusively focuses on improving the infrastructure of Government residential schools/hostels for tribal children.
3.  The Abhiyan aims to provide pucca houses for eligible tribal households under PM Awas Yojana (Gramin), along with access to tapped water and electricity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-JUGA is based on learnings and successes of PM-JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan), not PMJDY.  This is a crucial distinction, as PM-JANMAN is specifically targeted at tribal welfare, unlike PMJDY, which is a broader financial inclusion initiative.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While infrastructure improvement for Government residential schools/hostels is a component of PM-JUGA, it is not the scheme's exclusive focus. PM-JUGA adopts a more holistic approach, encompassing improvements across various sectors such as health, education, and livelihood enhancement.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Abhiyan explicitly aims to provide pucca houses for eligible tribal households under PM Awas Yojana (Gramin), ensuring access to essential amenities like tapped water and electricity.  This is a key component of the scheme's goal to improve overall living standards for tribal communities.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**5. With reference to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural level of existence, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy.
2.  Odisha has the lowest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and Union Territories.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The criteria for identifying PVTGs accurately reflect their unique socio-economic vulnerabilities and traditional way of life. These criteria are essential in understanding the specific challenges faced by these groups and in designing targeted interventions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Odisha has the highest number (13) of recognized PVTGs among all states and Union Territories, not the lowest.  This demonstrates the significant concentration of PVTGs in Odisha and the state's specific challenges in addressing their needs.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Habitat rights for PVTGs are granted under Section 3(1)(e), not 3(1)(f), of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. This seemingly minor detail highlights the importance of precise knowledge of legal provisions related to tribal rights.  Only statement 1 is correct.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, addresses narcotics, it's not the sole legal framework for anti-doping.  India's anti-doping efforts are primarily governed by the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) and its regulations, which are aligned with the World Anti-Doping Code (WADA).  The Act deals with a broader range of substances, not specifically targeting performance-enhancing drugs in sports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024, published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), indeed reported that 68.5% of the global gender gap had been closed in 2024.  This highlights the progress made but also underscores the significant distance remaining to achieve full gender parity.  The report provides a comprehensive assessment of gender equality across various dimensions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the report does rank countries, the provided text states that India's rank declined slightly in 2024 compared to 2023, placing it 129th out of 146 countries and only 5th in South Asia after Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan. This contradicts the statement's claim of significant improvement and top 5 placement in South Asia.  The ranking reflects the persistent challenges in achieving gender equality in India across various sectors.

Statement 3 is correct. The report's methodology is explicitly based on 14 indicators spread across four key dimensions: Health and Survival, Educational Attainment, Economic Participation and Opportunity, and Political Empowerment. These dimensions provide a multi-faceted view of gender inequality, assessing progress and identifying areas requiring further attention. The use of multiple indicators allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of gender inequality than a single metric would provide.


**2. With reference to the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GII 2022, released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), uses a scoring system ranging from 0 (complete equality) to 1 (maximum inequality), with lower scores indicating less gender inequality.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GII 2022, published by UNDP, indeed employs a scoring system ranging from 0 (complete gender equality) to 1 (maximum inequality).  A lower GII score signifies a lower level of gender inequality. This standardized scoring system allows for meaningful comparisons across countries and facilitates the monitoring of progress over time.  The index takes into account various factors related to reproductive health, empowerment, and economic opportunities for women.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text shows that India's rank in the GII 2022 was 108th out of 193 countries, while in 2021, it was 122nd out of 191 countries. This indicates an improvement, but the statement's claim of "significant improvement" is an overstatement.  The improvement, while positive, represents only a modest step towards achieving greater gender equality in India, and significant challenges remain.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text mentions that Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland consistently rank among the top three countries in the GII. This consistently high ranking reflects their strong commitment to and implementation of policies that promote gender equality, resulting in better outcomes for women across various aspects of life.  These countries serve as examples of best practices that other nations can learn from and adapt to their own contexts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UGC regulations of 2023 aim to attract high-quality foreign universities to establish campuses in India. This aligns directly with the National Education Policy 2020's goal of enhancing the quality and internationalization of Indian higher education.  The regulations are designed to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange between Indian and international institutions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The regulations stipulate that foreign universities seeking to set up campuses in India must be ranked within the global top 500, either overall or in specific subject areas, or possess outstanding expertise in a particular field. This criterion ensures that only high-quality institutions with a proven track record are allowed to operate in India. The ranking requirement maintains a high standard of education within the Indian higher education system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The regulations state that the UGC initially grants *in-principle* approval and issues a Letter of Intent (LoI) to the applicant FHEIs.  Final approval is not granted immediately.  The FHEIs are expected to establish their campuses within two years of receiving the LoI.  This phased approach allows for thorough assessment and ensures compliance with all regulations before full operational approval is granted.  The process prioritizes due diligence and avoids hasty approvals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GII uses a scoring system ranging from 0 (where women and men fare equally) to 1 (where one gender fares as poorly as possible), with a lower score indicating lower gender inequality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's ranking improved, but the statement misrepresents the degree of improvement.  While it did improve, it did not improve significantly.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The GII considers various dimensions of gender inequality, including reproductive health, empowerment, and economic opportunity, offering a multi-dimensional assessment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments define a pandemic emergency more broadly to include communicable diseases with wide geographical spread or high risk of one, exceeding national health system response capabilities.  It's not limited to viral diseases.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The amendments establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to address the needs of *developing* countries to improve pandemic response and preparedness.  It does not focus solely on developed countries.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The amendments establish both National IHR Authorities and a States Parties Committee to enhance coordination and implementation.


**13. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by focusing solely on providing financial assistance.
2. The scheme is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known for leading the ‘Ulgulan movement’ against British rule.
3. The scheme's funding is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds, independent of existing development schemes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-JUGA aims to improve socio-economic conditions through convergence and outreach, using various existing schemes to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood.  It's not just financial assistance.

Statement 2 is correct. The scheme is indeed named after Birsa Munda, who is known as 'Dharti Aaba' and led the 'Ulgulan movement' against British rule.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The scheme uses funding from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It does not rely on entirely new funds.

3. The Eat Right Movement is an independent initiative unrelated to POSHAN Abhiyan or the NFSA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NFSA, 2013, recognizes the right to food as a *statutory* right, not a fundamental right under the constitution.  While it's a significant step towards food security, it's not constitutionally enshrined.

Statement 2 is correct. POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) primarily aims at improving maternal and child nutrition through various interventions, including supplementary nutrition.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Eat Right Movement is closely related to POSHAN Abhiyan, working towards improving nutritional practices and food safety in India; it is not an independent initiative.


**15.  With reference to the  Asmita Project and related initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The Asmita Project aims to translate educational materials into only 10 scheduled languages, limiting access for many students.
2. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is a multilingual dictionary repository that includes only Indian languages, excluding international languages.

Statement 3 is correct.  GAIN actively supports public-private partnerships to improve access to essential nutrients in diets, tackling micronutrient deficiencies.



**1. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NIRF framework uses only four parameters: Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; and Perception to rank educational institutions.
2.  The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) is the sole implementing agency for NIRF rankings.
3.  In the NIRF 2024 rankings, IIT Madras topped the overall category for the sixth consecutive time, while IISc Bangalore topped the Universities category for the ninth consecutive time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NIRF framework actually uses five parameters: Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.  The addition of an "Innovation" ranking within the NIRF framework is an important point, but it doesn't replace or reduce the original five parameters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NBA plays a crucial role, it collaborates with the INFLIBNET Centre in Gandhinagar in implementing the NIRF rankings.  It's a joint effort, not solely the NBA's responsibility.

Statement 3 is correct.  This accurately reflects the outcomes of the 2024 NIRF rankings.  The consistent top rankings of IIT Madras and IISc Bangalore are significant indicators of their sustained excellence.  This is a demonstrably factual statement and a key takeaway from the NIRF report.


**2. With reference to global university rankings, consider the following statements:**

1. The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2025 included over 2,500 universities from more than 120 countries.
2.  In the QS World University Rankings 2025, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) was ranked within the top 100 globally.
3. The University Impact Rankings 2024, published by THE, assesses universities based on their performance across all 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the THE rankings are indeed extensive, the provided text states that the 2025 rankings included 2,092 universities from 115 countries and territories, not over 2,500 from more than 120.  The numbers are significantly different, making this statement factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions IIT-B's top ranking among Indian institutions at 118th position globally in the QS World University Rankings 2025. This is a precise and verifiable piece of information.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text specifies that the THE University Impact Rankings assess universities based on their performance across *multiple* UN SDGs, not *all* 17.  This subtle yet crucial difference renders the statement false.  The number of SDGs assessed is a key detail and its misrepresentation makes the statement incorrect.


**3. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

1. The ANRF was established under the ANRF Act of 2022, subsuming the erstwhile Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).
2.  The ANRF's "Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)" focuses exclusively on research in renewable energy sources.
3. The ANRF aims to mobilize a total of ₹60,000 crore for the period 2023-2028, with equal contributions from the Centre and private sources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but needs clarification.  The ANRF was indeed established under the ANRF Act 2023, and SERB was subsumed into it. The year mentioned is incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While MAHA does support research in areas like EV mobility and solar cells (which are related to renewable energy), it is not exclusively focused on renewable energy. It encompasses a broader range of high-impact areas, including advanced materials and health & medical technology.  The scope of MAHA is wider than what is stated.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that ₹50,000 crore will be mobilized (₹14,000 crore from the Centre and ₹36,000 crore from private sources), not ₹60,000 crore with equal contributions. The figures are different, making the statement factually wrong.  The funding breakdown is critical information that is misrepresented here.



**4. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a high risk of wide geographical spread, exceeding national health system response capabilities.
2.  The amendments establish a new global health security fund to solely finance developing countries' responses to pandemic emergencies.
3. The amendments mandate the creation of a global body to directly oversee and enforce IHR compliance by all member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the amended definition of a pandemic emergency as including wide geographical spread and exceeding national response capabilities. This is a key feature of the amendments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the amendments *do* establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to support developing countries, it's not a solely dedicated fund but a mechanism for addressing financial needs and priorities – a crucial difference in terms of governance and implementation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The amendments establish a States Parties Committee to improve IHR implementation, but this is not a global body with direct oversight and enforcement power over individual member states.  The role of the committee is primarily facilitative and collaborative rather than directly authoritarian.  The difference in the level of authority is key.


**5. With reference to the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Alliance was launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2023 in Indonesia.
2.  The Alliance's Policy Basket comprises various policy instruments aimed at achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 2, and 10.
3. The Alliance comprises over 100 member countries, including India, and at least 20 international organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Alliance was launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in Brazil, not in 2023 in Indonesia. The year and location are both inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the Alliance's Policy Basket and its alignment with SDGs 1, 2, and 10 (poverty, hunger, and reduced inequalities).

Statement 3 is correct.  The text mentions 91 member countries and 25 international organizations, exceeding the numbers given in the statement.  While the exact numbers are slightly higher than stated, the general fact remains true that the Alliance has numerous member countries and international organizations. The numbers are close enough to not invalidate the statement's core meaning.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the National Medical Commission (NMC):**

1. The NMC's mandate includes framing guidelines for fee determination in private medical institutions, but this applies only to 25% of the seats.
2.  The NMC is responsible for assessing healthcare requirements and developing roadmaps to meet them, but this function is primarily advisory and not directly implemented.
3.  The NMC replaced the Medical Council of India in 2020, inheriting its regulatory and policy-making functions related to medical education and professionals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NMC does frame guidelines for fee determination in private medical institutions, but this applies to 50% of the seats, not 25%. This is a crucial detail that changes the accuracy of the statement.  The NMC's role in regulating fees is a significant aspect of its regulatory power, aiming to balance affordability and quality in private medical education.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleadingly presented.  The NMC does assess healthcare needs and develops roadmaps. However, it doesn't directly implement these roadmaps. Its role is primarily advisory and regulatory, influencing policy but not having direct executive power to implement healthcare infrastructure development. This distinction is key.  The statement oversimplifies a complex interplay between advisory and policy-making roles.

Statement 3 is correct. The NMC Act, 2019, established the NMC as a replacement for the Medical Council of India in 2020.  This transition involved a significant shift in the regulatory landscape of medical education and practice in India.  The NMC inherited the responsibilities of the MCI, but with a reformed structure and mandate.  This is a well-established and easily verifiable fact.

Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate. The other statements contain inaccuracies or misleading simplifications.


**2. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), consider the following statements:**

1. SDG 4 focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all, including improved access to quality health facilities for Scheduled Tribes.
2. SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, including the reduction of infant mortality rates (IMR) and maternal mortality rates (MMR).
3. The National Health Mission's use of Mobile Medical Units to improve immunization coverage demonstrates a direct contribution to achieving SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. SDG 4, Quality Education, has a broad mandate encompassing various aspects of education and learning.  The reference to improved access to quality health facilities for Scheduled Tribes is a relevant component within the broader context of SDG 4, reflecting the interlinkages between education, health, and social equity.

Statement 2 is correct. SDG 3, Good Health and Well-being, directly addresses the reduction of IMR and MMR. These are key indicators used to monitor progress towards the broader goal of improving global health outcomes.  The statement accurately reflects the core objectives of SDG 3.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Mobile Medical Units contribute to health outcomes, their primary impact aligns with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and possibly SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).  They do not directly contribute to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), which focuses on sustainable consumption and production patterns.  Attributing their impact to SDG 12 is a misinterpretation of the goal's focus.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate reflections of the SDGs mentioned.


**3. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Food Waste Index (FWI) measures food waste at the production level, including post-harvest losses, and retail and consumer levels, but excludes inedible parts.
2. The FWI report, overseen by the UNEP, supports SDG 12.3.1 (b), aiming to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030.
3. The report's key finding that households globally wasted over 1 billion meals daily in 2022 directly correlates with the estimated 8-10% contribution of food waste to global greenhouse gas emissions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FWI *does* include inedible parts wasted at retail and consumer levels in its measurements. This is a crucial detail that distinguishes the FWI's scope from other food waste metrics.  The inclusion of inedible parts is important for a comprehensive understanding of total food waste generation.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNEP's role as custodian of the FWI and its alignment with SDG 12.3.1 (b) are accurately stated. This goal specifically targets reducing food waste at the retail and consumer levels, which is the core focus of the FWI report.

Statement 3 is partially correct but presents a weak correlation. While the report does find high levels of household food waste, directly linking this to the 8-10% greenhouse gas emission figure is an oversimplification.  The 8-10% figure represents the estimated overall contribution of food waste to emissions, encompassing all stages of the food system, not just household waste.  The correlation is plausible but not definitively established by the given information.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 present accurate information, albeit with a nuance regarding the correlation in statement 3.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Passive Euthanasia:**

1. The draft guidelines released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for withdrawing life support in terminally ill patients define "terminal illness" precisely and exclude any ambiguity in determining eligibility for passive euthanasia.
2.  The guidelines mandate the constitution of a Primary Medical Board (PMB) and a Secondary Medical Board (SMB) to review proposals for foregoing Life-Sustaining Treatments (LST), ensuring a multi-layered approach to decision-making.
3. Karnataka's decision to allow terminally ill patients to die with dignity aligns with Supreme Court directives but only applies to individuals who have explicitly expressed their wishes prior to becoming incapacitated.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the draft guidelines aim to define "terminal illness," the definition itself is likely to be complex and subject to interpretation.  Defining such a sensitive and multifaceted concept with absolute precision is highly unlikely, leaving room for ambiguity in application.

Statement 2 is correct. The establishment of PMB and SMB is a core feature of the guidelines, creating a system of checks and balances in the decision-making process. This multi-layered approach is a crucial aspect of ensuring ethical and responsible implementation of passive euthanasia procedures.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Karnataka's decision is aligned with Supreme Court directives, the requirement for prior explicit expression of wishes is not universally applicable across all jurisdictions or interpretations of the court's ruling.  There is room for varied interpretations and approaches to determining the patient's wishes in different contexts.

Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes a key aspect of the draft guidelines for passive euthanasia.


**5. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendment allows surrogacy with a donor gamete (egg or sperm) only if the intended parents are unable to produce their own gametes due to a medical condition certified by the District Medical Board. The child must have at least one gamete from the couple.
2.  Single women (widows or divorcees) are permitted to avail surrogacy, but only using their own eggs and donor sperm.
3. The amendment maintains the existing prohibition on commercial surrogacy, reaffirming the principle of altruistic surrogacy as the sole permissible form.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendment introduces a crucial change by allowing the use of donor gametes under specific medical conditions, certified by the District Medical Board, ensuring the child still has at least one gamete from the intending couple.

Statement 2 is correct.  The amendment allows single women (widows or divorcees) to undergo surrogacy. However, they must use their own eggs and donor sperm.  This is a significant departure from previous rules and reflects evolving social considerations.

Statement 3 is correct. The amendment upholds the ban on commercial surrogacy, reinforcing the ethical framework that only altruistic surrogacy is allowed.  This continues the policy of preventing exploitation and ensuring ethical practices.

Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024.


**1. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Food Waste Index (FWI) solely focuses on food waste generated at the household level, excluding retail and food service sectors.
2.  The FWI report supports SDG 12.3.1(b), aiming to halve per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels, with UNEP as the custodian.
3.  The report estimates that food waste contributes to 5-7% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Food Waste Index Report 2024, launched by UNEP and WRAP, directly supports SDG 12.3.1(b), focusing on halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels. UNEP serves as the custodian for this indicator.  The report comprehensively tracks food waste across various stages, including retail and consumer (household and food service) levels.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FWI's scope explicitly includes food waste generated at retail and consumer levels (household and food service), not solely at the household level.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report estimates that food waste contributes to 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, not the lower figure mentioned in the statement. This higher percentage highlights the significant environmental impact of food waste, a crucial aspect of sustainable development goals. The discrepancy illustrates the importance of precise factual recall in understanding the implications of the report.


**2. With reference to the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment and Spot Food License initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The NQAS assessment is exclusively implemented for private healthcare facilities to ensure adherence to Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS).
2. The Spot Food License Initiative streamlines the licensing process through a pan-India IT platform called the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) System.
3.  The initiatives aim to improve healthcare access and food safety across India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. Both the NQAS assessment and the Spot Food License initiative are aimed at improving healthcare access and food safety in India. The NQAS assessment ensures quality in public health facilities, while the Spot Food License initiative simplifies the licensing process for food businesses. These initiatives are part of a broader effort to improve public health and safety.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NQAS assessment is implemented for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL), which are public health facilities, not exclusively private ones.  It aims to ensure compliance with Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The initiative utilizes the Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS), not the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) System, as a pan-India IT platform for instant license issuance. The subtle name change highlights the importance of precision when dealing with government programs and initiatives.



**3. With reference to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) report, consider the following statements:**

1. GAIN’s report focuses on reducing gender inequality in the agricultural sector by promoting investments in non-nutritious food value chains.
2. The report emphasizes that investments in nutritious foods value chains can boost productivity and enhance business resilience.
3. The report suggests that promoting nutritional investments exclusively in the dairy sector will have the most significant impact on reducing gender inequalities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is accurate. GAIN's report, "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains," clearly advocates for investments in nutritious foods value chains to reduce gender inequalities, increase productivity, and enhance business resilience within the agri-food sector.  The report's focus on the interconnectedness of nutrition, gender equality, and economic development makes it a valuable resource for policymakers.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report focuses on *nutritious* food value chains, not non-nutritious ones.  This distinction is crucial because the report's recommendations are directly tied to improving nutritional outcomes and reducing malnutrition, which is a major public health concern.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report doesn't single out any specific sector like dairy for exclusive investment. Its recommendations are broader, encompassing various aspects of the agri-food sector to achieve holistic improvements in nutrition and gender equality.  The statement's oversimplification of the report’s nuanced approach demonstrates a common pitfall in interpreting complex policy documents.


**4. With reference to the Lakhpati Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lakhpati Didi initiative aims to empower 1 crore SHG members by providing them with financial assistance and skill development training.
2. A Lakhpati Didi is defined as an SHG member whose household earns an annual income of at least Rs. 1 lakh, calculated over at least two agricultural seasons or business cycles.
3. The initiative is implemented under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The Lakhpati Didi initiative is indeed an outcome of the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) under the Union Ministry of Rural Development.  Understanding the program's institutional context is crucial for analyzing its effectiveness and impact.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initiative's target is three crore Lakhpati Didis, not one crore.  The difference in scale highlights the ambition of the program and the potential challenges in achieving its goals.  The statement also incorrectly adds skill development training as a core component; while skill enhancement might be a beneficial outcome, it's not a primary focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The annual household income threshold for a Lakhpati Didi is calculated over at least four agricultural seasons and/or business cycles, not two.  This subtle difference in the calculation period significantly impacts the eligibility criteria and the overall assessment of the program's success.  The precision of this detail is important for evaluating the initiative's actual reach and impact.



**5.  With reference to the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in higher education, consider the following statements:**

1. RPL is a formal mechanism that solely evaluates knowledge and skills acquired through formal education.
2. The primary purpose of RPL is to provide a pathway for individuals with prior learning to obtain higher education degrees or certificates.
3. The implementation of RPL in India aims to improve the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 3 are correct. The main purpose of RPL is to provide a pathway for individuals with prior learning (formal, non-formal, or informal) to gain recognition for their skills and knowledge, allowing them to access higher education.  RPL's implementation in India is expected to contribute to improving the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) by enabling more individuals to participate in higher education.

Statement 1 is incorrect. RPL evaluates knowledge and skills acquired through formal, non-formal, and informal learning, not just formal education.  The inclusion of non-formal and informal learning is a key feature of RPL, making it a valuable tool for recognizing the diverse learning pathways of individuals.  This broad scope is crucial to its effectiveness in reaching underserved populations and promoting lifelong learning.


**6. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024 report indicates that global hunger levels are significantly decreasing, putting the “Zero Hunger” goal within reach by 2030.
2. India's GHI score improved in 2024 compared to the previous year, although child wasting and stunting remain high concerns.
3. The GHI report highlights the link between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The GHI 2024 report shows that India's ranking improved, moving from 111th in 2023 to 105th in 2024.  However, it also notes that child wasting and stunting remain significant challenges. The report also emphasizes the strong correlation between gender inequality, climate change, and the prevalence of hunger globally.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The GHI 2024 shows that hunger levels in many countries are alarmingly high, making the “Zero Hunger” goal by 2030 unlikely to be achieved.  The statement misrepresents the report's key finding on the worsening global hunger crisis.  This emphasizes the importance of carefully reviewing the report's findings and avoiding generalizations.


**7. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. NIRF rankings are determined solely based on the perception of institutions among stakeholders.
2. The NIRF 2024 rankings introduced new categories for Open Universities and Skill Universities.
3. The Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, topped the overall category in NIRF 2024.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  NIRF 2024 did introduce new categories for ranking, including Open Universities and Skill Universities, reflecting the evolving landscape of higher education in India.

Statement 1 is incorrect. NIRF rankings are based on five parameters: Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.  While perception is one factor, it's not the sole determinant of the rankings.  The statement's oversimplification of the complex ranking methodology is a common pitfall.

Statement 3 is incorrect. IIT Madras topped the overall category, not IISc Bangalore.  IISc Bangalore topped the Universities category. The confusion between these two top-performing institutions highlights the importance of accurate recall in interpreting ranking data.  The subtle difference in the ranking categories illustrates the complexity of comparing institutions across different types.


**8. With reference to the  Habitat Rights under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, consider the following statements:**

1. Habitat rights are granted only to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) residing in non-forest areas.
2. The Act defines "habitat" to include customary habitat and other habitats within reserved and protected forests of various forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.
3. The granting of habitat rights involves consultations with relevant stakeholders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006 clearly defines "habitat" to encompass customary and other habitats within reserved and protected forests for specific groups including PVTGs and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.  The process of granting habitat rights involves mandatory consultations with stakeholders.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Habitat rights are granted to PVTGs and other eligible forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes residing in forest areas, not exclusively non-forest areas.  This limited scope is a crucial detail that differentiates habitat rights from other forms of land rights granted under the FRA. The statement's incorrect restriction of habitat rights to non-forest areas demonstrates a misunderstanding of the act's provisions.


**9. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1. The government has identified 75 PVTGs across 17 states and one Union Territory.
2.  Criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, a pre-agricultural level of existence, and a high literacy rate.
3. The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme aims for their socio-economic development while preserving their culture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The government has recognized 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory. The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme aims to comprehensively improve the socio-economic conditions of PVTGs while preserving their unique cultural heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. One of the criteria for identifying PVTGs is an *extremely low* literacy rate, not a high one.  This is a crucial detail that highlights the challenges faced by these groups and the need for targeted interventions.  The statement's contradictory information on literacy rates demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the characteristics of PVTGs.


**1. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with only a "wide geographical spread," irrespective of national health system capacity.
2.  A new States Parties Committee is established to ensure effective IHR implementation, replacing existing WHO mechanisms.
3. The amendments establish a global fund to exclusively support developed nations in pandemic preparedness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the IHR, 2005, significantly revised the definition of a pandemic emergency.  While a "wide geographical spread" is a key criterion, the amendments also include the exceeding or potential exceeding of national health systems' response capabilities as a crucial element. Statement 1 incorrectly simplifies this crucial dual requirement. Statement 2 is correct; the establishment of a States Parties Committee is a key feature of the amendments, designed to improve international coordination and accountability. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the amendments do establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism, it's designed to address the needs of *developing* countries, not developed ones, reflecting a focus on global health equity.  The mechanism aims to bridge resource gaps and support pandemic preparedness in nations with weaker health infrastructures.  The focus on developing countries is a crucial aspect of the amendments, reflecting the disproportionate impact of pandemics on these regions.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure for tribal communities by solely utilizing funds from newly allocated budgets.
2. The scheme focuses on promoting tribal home stays under the Swadesh Darshan scheme, aiming for 1000 such stays.
3.  PM-JUGA includes initiatives for improving government residential schools/hostels for tribal children, but excludes healthcare initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because PM-JUGA leverages existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, not solely relying on new allocations.  The scheme aims for convergence and optimal utilization of existing resources. Statement 2 is correct; the promotion of tribal home stays is a key component of PM-JUGA, designed to boost rural tourism and livelihoods. Statement 3 is incorrect. While PM-JUGA does focus on improving educational infrastructure, it also includes significant healthcare initiatives.  The scheme aims for holistic development, covering education, health, livelihood, and infrastructure. The inclusion of healthcare is crucial for addressing the health disparities faced by tribal communities. The program's comprehensive approach is central to its effectiveness.


**3. With reference to the National Medical Register (NMR) Portal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMR is mandated under Section 32 of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019 and includes all registered medical practitioners regardless of their specialization.
2.  The NMR aims to interlink State Medical Councils (SMCs) for streamlined verification of registrations and is linked to the Aadhaar ID of doctors for authentication.
3. The NMR's establishment replaces the existing state-level medical registries entirely, centralizing all medical registration processes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NMR is mandated under Section 31, not Section 32, of the NMC Act, 2019.  Further, the NMR currently focuses on allopathic (MBBS) registered doctors; inclusion of other medical practitioners might be a future development.  Statement 2 is correct.  The NMR aims to enhance interconnectivity between SMCs, improving the efficiency of verification processes.  Linking with Aadhaar IDs is crucial for ensuring authenticity and preventing fraudulent registrations. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NMR complements, rather than replaces, state-level medical registries. While it improves national-level coordination and data management, state-level registries continue to play a vital role in local medical registration processes. The NMR's function is to improve interoperability and data sharing, not to supersede existing state mechanisms entirely.


**4. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The report indicates that the global gender gap has closed by 70% in 2024, with the Health and Survival dimension showing the most progress.
2.  India's ranking improved in the 2024 report compared to 2023, primarily due to significant advancements in Economic Participation and Opportunity.
3. The report uses the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), which benchmarks gender parity across four dimensions, including Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The report does show significant progress in closing the global gender gap, but the percentage closed is 68.5%, not 70%. Health and Survival did show the most progress. Statement 2 is incorrect. India's ranking actually declined slightly in the 2024 report compared to 2023. While there was some improvement in Economic Participation and Opportunity, this was not enough to offset declines in other dimensions. Statement 3 is entirely correct. The GGGI is indeed the core of the report's methodology, using the four specified dimensions to assess gender parity.  Understanding the GGGI's components and the nuances of the report's findings is crucial for a thorough analysis of gender inequality globally.


**5. With reference to the  'Food Waste Index Report 2024', consider the following statements:**

1. The report, launched by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), tracks food waste at the production and supply chain levels, including post-harvest losses.
2.  The report indicates that household food waste globally generated an estimated 9-11% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.
3. The report supports SDG 12.3.1 (b), aiming to halve per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels by 2030.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the report does address food loss along production and supply chains, it is primarily focused on food waste at the retail and consumer levels. The FAO is the custodian of SDG 12.3.1 (a) (Food Loss Index), not the Food Waste Index.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The report estimates that food waste generates 8-10%, not 9-11%, of global greenhouse gas emissions.  Statement 3 is correct. The Food Waste Index Report directly supports SDG 12.3.1 (b), which aims to reduce food waste at the retail and consumer levels.  Understanding the specific focus of the report and its linkage to the SDGs is critical for analyzing global food sustainability efforts.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, a pre-agricultural level of existence, and a stagnant or declining population, but excludes literacy levels.
2.  Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and Union Territories, exceeding 15.
3. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central assistance, focusing solely on financial aid and excluding infrastructural development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs explicitly includes extremely low literacy rates along with forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural existence, and a stagnant or declining population.  The question attempts to mislead by omitting this crucial criterion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Odisha does have a significant number of PVTGs, the provided text states it has 13, not more than 15. The number is a factual detail, and the question uses a slightly inflated figure to create a distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The scheme does indeed provide 100% central assistance, but this assistance is used for a range of activities including education, housing, agricultural development, infrastructure strengthening, renewable energy installation, and social security, not solely financial aid.  The question wrongly restricts the scheme's scope to solely financial aid.  Therefore, only statement 2 is partially correct (though the number is off) while the others are completely incorrect.


**2. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines 'habitat' to encompass only the customary habitat of primitive tribal groups within reserved and protected forests.
2. Habitat rights under the FRA are granted without any consultation process with relevant stakeholders.
3. The FRA mandates habitat rights for all forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes (STs) regardless of their customary practices.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FRA's definition of 'habitat' is broader than stated; it includes customary habitats and *other* habitats in reserved and protected forests for primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling STs.  The question tries to narrow the definition to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FRA explicitly mentions a sequence of consultations with stakeholders before granting habitat rights. This is a key aspect of the Act's implementation. The question presents the opposite to create confusion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FRA doesn't automatically grant habitat rights to all forest-dwelling STs.  The entitlement is based on customary usage and other factors, not mere residency in a forest.  The question attempts to oversimplify the Act's provisions.  All three statements contain inaccuracies, making option (d) the correct answer.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to achieve complete saturation of social infrastructure gaps in tribal villages within two years of its launch.
2.  The scheme primarily focuses on providing financial assistance to individual tribal households, excluding infrastructural development.
3. PM-JUGA's interventions are exclusively implemented by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, without inter-ministerial collaboration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The scheme has a five-year tenure (2024-29), indicating that complete saturation of infrastructure gaps is not expected within two years.  The question uses a shorter timeframe to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PM-JUGA aims to improve socio-economic conditions through various interventions, including infrastructural development, not just direct financial assistance to households. The question wrongly restricts its focus.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The scheme involves 17 line ministries, showcasing a collaborative, multi-ministerial approach. The question falsely claims exclusive implementation by a single ministry.  All three statements contain significant inaccuracies, leading to option (d) as the correct answer.


**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024 ranks India in the "moderate" category of hunger severity, indicating significant improvement from previous years.
2.  The GHI report highlights a strong correlation between gender inequality and hunger levels but downplays the impact of climate change.
3. Child wasting and stunting rates in India, as reported by the GHI 2024, are below the global average.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 places India in the "serious" category, not "moderate," indicating a persistent challenge with hunger.  The question alters the severity level to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The report explicitly highlights the link between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.  The question wrongly claims the report downplays climate change's impact.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 reports significantly high rates of child wasting and stunting in India, well above the global average. The question presents the opposite to act as a distractor.  Because all three statements are factually incorrect, the correct answer is (d).


**5. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NIRF 2024 rankings introduced a new category for private universities but excluded public universities.
2.  The NIRF uses only four parameters for ranking educational institutions, omitting "Outreach and Inclusivity".
3.  In the NIRF 2024, IIT Madras retained its top position in the Overall category, while IISc Bangalore topped the Universities category.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NIRF 2024 added categories for Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities, not just private universities. The question presents an incomplete and misleading picture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NIRF employs five parameters: Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception. The question omits a key parameter to confuse.

Statement 3 is correct.  This accurately reflects the NIRF 2024 results. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct, making (b) the correct option.


**6. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs, and all DNTs are nomadic.
2. The Supreme Court judgement in Sukanya Santha vs. UoI struck down provisions in prison manuals that discriminated against DNTs based on caste.
3.  DNTs were officially designated as "criminal tribes" during the British Raj under the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, reflecting their inherent criminal tendencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The relationship between nomadic tribes and DNTs is not one of complete overlap. While many DNTs are nomadic, not all nomadic tribes are DNTs. The question presents a false equivalence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court judgement did indeed strike down caste-based discriminatory provisions in prison manuals affecting DNTs.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 wrongly labeled certain communities as "criminal tribes," a prejudiced and inaccurate designation. The statement reinforces this false notion of inherent criminality.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (a) the correct answer.  The question uses loaded language in statement 3 to create a distractor.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

Statement 1 correctly outlines the UN-CRPD's objective.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the convention refers to *long-term* impairments.  Statement 3 is incorrect; India *is* a signatory.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**1. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD, adopted in 2006 and entering into force in 2008, aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, with a primary focus on economic empowerment.
2.  The 17th session of the Conference of States Parties to the UN-CRPD focused on the theme "Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future," emphasizing technological advancements in assistive technologies.
3. The Biwako Millennium Framework, related to the UN-CRPD, advocates for a rights-based society that prioritizes the integration of persons with disabilities into mainstream education, completely disregarding vocational training.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the UN-CRPD's aim is indeed to promote the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and freedoms for persons with disabilities,  the statement overemphasizes economic empowerment as the primary focus.  The convention's scope is much broader, encompassing all aspects of human rights, including social, political, and civil rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The 17th session's theme accurately reflects the focus on rethinking disability inclusion.  However, while technological advancements are relevant, the statement exaggerates their prominence, neglecting other crucial aspects of the conference's discussions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Biwako Millennium Framework does advocate for an inclusive and rights-based society. However, the claim that it completely disregards vocational training is false.  The framework promotes a holistic approach to inclusion, encompassing various aspects of life, including education and vocational opportunities.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA, named after Birsa Munda, aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by focusing solely on financial assistance and direct cash transfers, neglecting infrastructural development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the amendments *do* establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism, it's not described as a completely independent global fund. The passage emphasizes that this mechanism aims to address the needs of developing countries, implying a focus on resource allocation and coordination rather than a separate, entirely independent fund.

Statement 3 correctly identifies the establishment of a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation and the creation of National IHR Authorities to improve coordination among countries.  These measures aim to strengthen the global health security architecture.


**6. With reference to the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) Goals, consider the following statements:**

1. Goal 1 focuses on developing enabling infrastructure in tribal villages, including pucca houses, access to clean water and electricity, and Ayushman Bharat cards, while Goal 2 concentrates on skill development, entrepreneurship promotion, and improved livelihoods.
2. Goal 3 prioritizes universalizing access to quality and affordable education for Scheduled Tribe (ST) students, targeting increased Gross Enrollment Ratios (GER) at the national level by establishing tribal hostels in schools.
3.  PM-JUGA's implementation will leverage existing schemes like PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin), Jal Jeevan Mission, PM Gram Sadak Yojana, Bharat Net, National Health Mission, Samagra Shiksha, and Skill India Mission, among others.

Statement 2 correctly describes Goal 3, emphasizing the aim of achieving national-level GER for ST students through initiatives such as establishing tribal hostels.

Statement 3 is also correct. The passage explicitly states that PM-JUGA will utilize existing schemes for its implementation, and it lists several key schemes that will be leveraged.  This emphasizes the convergence approach of PM-JUGA.


**1. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2006 and has 170 signatory nations, including India.
2.  The convention's objective is solely focused on providing economic assistance to individuals with disabilities.
3. The definition of "persons with disabilities" under the UN-CRPD includes those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the UN-CRPD entered into force in 2008, not 2006, and the number of signatory nations is 164, not 170, as of the provided text.  While India is a signatory, the precise number of signatories might fluctuate over time.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the UN-CRPD's objective is far broader than just economic assistance. It aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. This includes social, political, and civil rights, not just economic ones.  Statement 3 is correct. The UN-CRPD explicitly defines persons with disabilities as those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities over a 10-year period, focusing primarily on skill development.
2. The scheme's funding is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds specifically designated for this program.
3.  The Abhiyan's interventions are implemented solely by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  The duration of PM-JUGA is 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29), not 10.  While skill development is a component, the scheme's scope is much broader, encompassing improvements in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The funding for PM-JUGA comes from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes, not from newly allocated funds. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The Abhiyan involves 17 line ministries, not just the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, indicating a multi-ministerial approach to its implementation.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.


**3. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following statements:**

2. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed in 1950.
3. The Idate Commission recommended the immediate repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act in all states to prevent harassment of DNT members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While many DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, the two categories are not entirely synonymous.  Not all nomadic tribes were ever designated as criminal tribes, and not all DNTs are exclusively nomadic. Statement 2 is incorrect regarding the year of repeal. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed in 1949, not 1950, and subsequently, the 'criminal tribes' were denotified in 1952. Statement 3 is correct. The Idate Commission (2017) did indeed recommend the immediate repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act by respective States, citing its potential for harassment of DNT members.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**4. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

3. The curriculum focuses exclusively on academic learning, preparing children for formal schooling.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadharshila is a 48-week curriculum, not a 40-week one, and it is designed for children aged 3 to 6 years, not 2 to 5 years.  Statement 2 is correct.  Aadharshila explicitly includes an age-appropriate screening tool to help integrate children with disabilities into the learning environment. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Aadharshila includes academic elements, it emphasizes play-based learning and holistic development, not just academic preparation for formal schooling.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that India is ranked 105th, not 106th, out of 127 countries in the GHI 2024. Statement 2 is correct.  The GHI 2024 report explicitly points to the interconnections between climate change, gender inequality, and the severity of hunger. Statement 3 is incorrect. India's GHI score of 27.3 falls under the "serious" category, not "low," indicating significant hunger levels within the country.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**7. With reference to Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, consider the following statements:**

1. Habitat rights are exclusively granted to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) residing in reserved forests.
2. The FRA defines 'habitat' as the area comprising only customary habitats of primitive tribal groups in protected forests.
3.  The granting of habitat rights involves consultations with relevant stakeholders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Habitat rights are primarily given to PVTGs, they are not exclusively limited to PVTGs residing in reserved forests.  The act also includes other forest dwelling STs. Statement 2 is incorrect because the FRA's definition of 'habitat' encompasses customary habitats and other habitats in reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling STs.  Statement 3 is correct. The process of granting habitat rights mandates consultations with various stakeholders to ensure transparency and inclusivity. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FWI explicitly tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels (household and food service), in addition to considering global and national generation of food and inedible parts.  The scope is broader than just production-level waste.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FWI report for 2022 revealed a significantly higher figure: households across all continents wasted *over* 1 billion meals a day. This demonstrates a substantial amount of food waste at the consumer level.

Statement 3 is correct. The UNEP (UN Environment Programme) is indeed the custodian of the FWI, while the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) holds the custodianship for the FLI.  This division of responsibility reflects the different focuses of the two indices: FWI on retail and consumer waste, and FLI on food losses along the production and supply chains.  Understanding the roles of these organizations is crucial for comprehending the global efforts to reduce food waste and loss, aligning with SDG 12.3.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NQAS Assessment is specifically launched for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs), which are public health facilities. The initiative aims to improve the quality of public healthcare services, not private ones.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Spot Food License Initiative utilizes a pan-India IT platform, the Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS), for instant issuance of licenses and registrations. This is a centralized, online system, not a decentralized, offline one. The aim is to improve efficiency and transparency in the licensing process.

Statement 3 is correct. The NQAS Assessment is directly aligned with the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS). The IPHS itself leverages a digital platform for real-time monitoring of public health facilities, providing a comprehensive overview of assessment and compliance. This digital aspect is a key feature of the initiative.


**3. With reference to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), consider the following statements:**

The report highlights the persistent challenges in eradicating hunger and malnutrition globally.  The significant number of people facing hunger in 2023 underscores this point.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report defines financing for food security and nutrition to encompass *both* public and private financial resources, from *both* domestic and foreign sources.  It recognizes that a comprehensive approach requires a diverse range of funding mechanisms.

Statement 3 is correct.  The report explicitly emphasizes the importance of the four pillars of food security—availability, access, utilization, and stability—with a focus on nutritious and safe foods.  Strengthening agrifood systems is a key aspect of ensuring food security and nutrition, requiring attention to these four dimensions.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lakhpati Didi initiative targets three crore Lakhpati Didis, not one crore, and the target year is not specified as 2025 in the provided text. The ambitious goal reflects a significant expansion of economic opportunities for women in rural areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The annual household income threshold for a Lakhpati Didi is indeed Rs. 1 lakh, but this must be calculated over at least *four* agricultural seasons and/or business cycles, not just two. The longer timeframe ensures a more stable and reliable assessment of income.

Statement 3 is correct. The initiative provides crucial financial assistance, including capitalization support through RFs and CIFs. It also facilitates access to collateral-free bank loans, significantly reducing barriers to financial inclusion for women SHG members.  This multifaceted support system is essential for achieving the initiative's goals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GII 2022 was released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank. The scoring system is accurate: 0 represents complete gender equality, and higher scores indicate greater gender inequality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's rank in the GII 2022 was 108th out of 193 countries, which represents a slight improvement from its 2021 rank of 122nd out of 191 countries. However, "significantly improved" is an overstatement of the change.

Statement 3 is correct. Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland consistently rank high in global gender equality indices, and the GII 2022 confirms this trend.  Their high rankings reflect their commitment to gender equality through various policies and programs.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SHA 2011 is a result of joint cooperation among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the WHO, and Eurostat. It is a globally recognized framework, not solely a WHO product.

Statement 2 is correct. The SHA 2011 provides a standardized way of classifying health expenditures along three key dimensions: consumption, provision, and financing. This facilitates comparability across countries.

Statement 3 is correct.  The SHA 2011 framework is indeed used as the basis for preparing the NHA estimates for India, as indicated by the fact that the NHA estimates are derived within the framework of National Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2016.  This makes the SHA 2011 crucial for understanding India's health financing landscape.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 report indicates that hunger levels in 42 countries, not 41, are at alarming levels, making the 2030 Zero Hunger goal seemingly unattainable. The precise number of countries is significant in assessing the global hunger crisis.

Statement 2 is correct. India's GHI score did improve to 27.3 in 2024, compared to the previous year.  However, this still places India in the "serious" category, ranking 105th out of 127 countries.  The improvement, while positive, points to the persistence of significant hunger challenges.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The GHI report does highlight a link between gender inequality and hunger, noting that women and girls are disproportionately affected by food insecurity and malnutrition. However, it doesn't state a strong correlation implying causation, but rather an association.  The nuanced relationship between gender inequality and hunger requires careful consideration.


**5. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India in 2021-22, consider the following statements:**

1. The Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP increased to 3.93% from 3.31% between 2017-18 and 2021-22.
2.  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) constituted 48% of THE in 2021-22, showing an increase from 40.8% in 2017-18.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  Statement 1 is incorrect as it states a complete prohibition for those under 18, while the act allows for exceptions. Statement 2 is incorrect because while the Act does allow for work in family enterprises, it is not without restrictions; certain conditions must be met. Statement 3 is partially correct in that it mentions an exception for child artists, but the exception is not a blanket exemption from all provisions of the Act;  it’s subject to specific regulations. Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate. The Act is complex, with nuances and exceptions that need careful understanding, making it a challenging topic for accurate recall.

3. The Act mandates a compulsory three-month time limit for the completion of preliminary assessments in all cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, covers both children in conflict with the law and those in need of care and protection.  Statement 2 is incorrect as appeals against preliminary assessment orders are to be filed before the Children's Court (where available), not necessarily the Sessions Court. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the three-month time limit for preliminary assessment is not mandatory but merely directory. The Supreme Court's judgment in the "Child in Conflict with Law (CCL) through his mother v. State of Karnataka" case highlighted this.  All three statements misrepresent crucial aspects of the Act, emphasizing the importance of precise knowledge of its provisions.  Understanding the complexities of the Act and associated case laws is vital for accurate analysis.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the amended IHR defines a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease that has a wide geographical spread *or* a high risk of one, and exceeds or can exceed national health systems' response capabilities.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism to address the needs of *developing* countries, not solely developed ones.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the amendments do not replace the WHO but aim to strengthen its role and improve international coordination through mechanisms like National IHR Authorities and a States Parties Committee.  The statements demonstrate the need for a nuanced understanding of the complex international framework governing global health emergencies.  Accurate knowledge of the specific details of the IHR amendments is crucial for a correct response.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while the Act primarily focuses on women in the organized sector, its application and interpretation are evolving to encompass a broader range of employment contexts, including some aspects of the informal sector.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the 2017 amendment *increased* paid maternity leave to 26 weeks for women with less than two surviving children, not reduced it.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act allows for work-from-home options for nursing mothers, depending on the nature of their work.  The statements illustrate potential misconceptions about the Act's scope and provisions, highlighting the need for a clear understanding of its evolving application and amendments.  The nuances of the Act's application require careful study to avoid incorrect assumptions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; Rule 43-C provides CCL to female employees *and* single male parents. Statement 2 is correct; there's no age limit for CCL in the case of a disabled child. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Supreme Court linked the denial of CCL to a violation of Article 15 (prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex), not Article 14 (equality before law). The subtle differences in the legal provisions and constitutional articles require careful attention to detail for accurate analysis.  Understanding the specific rules governing CCL and their constitutional basis is vital for a correct answer.


**7. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates 10% reservation for persons with disabilities (PwDs) in government jobs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act mandates 4% reservation in government jobs, not 10%. Statement 2 is incorrect; limited guardianship, as defined in the Act, is a system based on mutual understanding and trust between the guardian and the PwD, respecting the PwD's will. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act explicitly addresses the social security needs of PwDs by mandating the government to formulate programs to ensure an adequate standard of living.  The statements highlight the need for precise knowledge of the Act's key provisions and their implications.  Understanding the specific percentages of reservation and the nuances of the limited guardianship provision are crucial for a correct answer.


**8. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The amended rules completely prohibit surrogacy involving donor gametes.
2.  The amended rules allow single women to avail surrogacy only if they use their own eggs and donor sperm.
3. The amended rules allow for a maximum of 5 attempts of any surrogacy procedure on a surrogate mother.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the amended rules *allow* surrogacy with donor gametes under specific conditions (medical necessity and at least one gamete from the intended parents). Statement 2 is correct; single women (widows or divorcees) can avail surrogacy using their own eggs and donor sperm. Statement 3 is incorrect; the amended rules limit the number of surrogacy attempts to a maximum of 3, not 5. The amendments have introduced significant changes, and a precise understanding of these changes is necessary to answer the question correctly.  The subtle differences in the allowed number of attempts and the conditions for donor gamete usage are critical for accurate assessment.


**9. With reference to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, and its amendments, consider the following statements:**

1. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, increased the upper gestational limit for abortion to 32 weeks under all circumstances.
2.  The Act allows for abortion beyond 24 weeks only if there is a threat to the life of the pregnant woman.
3.  The opinion of only one Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP) is required for abortion up to 20 weeks of gestation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the 2021 amendment extended the gestational limit but not to 32 weeks under all circumstances;  it varies based on specific conditions and medical board approval. Statement 2 is incorrect; while threat to the mother's life is a ground for abortion beyond 24 weeks, it's not the only ground. Foetal abnormalities are also a key consideration. Statement 3 is correct; the opinion of one RMP suffices for abortions up to 20 weeks.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the MTP Act and its amendments, emphasizing the importance of understanding the nuances of gestational limits and the conditions for later-term abortions.  Misinterpreting the gestational limits and grounds for abortion beyond 24 weeks are common pitfalls.


**10. With reference to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The code completely repeals Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 1960.
2.  The code introduces new provisions for addressing cruelty towards married women.
3.  The code introduces provisions related to causing the miscarriage of women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, does not completely repeal Section 498A of the IPC but replaces it with similar provisions under Sections 85 and 86, addressing cruelty towards married women. Statement 2 is correct; the code introduces new provisions to address this issue, albeit with potential differences in scope and application compared to Section 498A. Statement 3 is correct; the code incorporates provisions related to causing miscarriage (Sections 88-92).  The question highlights the need to understand the transition from the IPC to the new code and the subtle yet significant changes in provisions related to domestic violence and abortion.  A lack of precise knowledge of the new code's provisions can easily lead to an incorrect answer.


**1. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with only a high risk of wide geographical spread, irrespective of national health system capacity.
2.  A States Parties Committee is established to ensure effective IHR implementation,  but there's no provision for a coordinating financial mechanism for developing countries.
3. The amendments mandate the creation of National IHR Authorities in all WHO member states to improve international coordination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate.  Statement 1 incorrectly simplifies the definition of a pandemic emergency in the amended IHR.  The amendment defines a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with *either* wide geographical spread *or* exceeding/potentially exceeding national health system response capacity. Both conditions are not required simultaneously. Statement 2 is incorrect because the amendments *do* establish a coordinating financial mechanism to support developing nations in pandemic preparedness and response.  Statement 3 is inaccurate because while the amendments encourage the creation of National IHR Authorities, they don't mandate it for *all* WHO member states. The creation is encouraged to enhance national coordination and collaboration with international efforts. The amendments aim for improved global coordination, not strict mandates on national structures in every country.  The nuances in the actual wording of the amendments create plausible distractors, making this a challenging question requiring precise recall of the IHR's details.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure for tribal communities within a 2-year timeframe by leveraging existing schemes.
2. The scheme's funding exclusively comes from newly allocated Central Sector funds specifically for this initiative.
3.  PM-JUGA includes initiatives like promoting tribal homestays under Swadesh Darshan and establishing Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect as PM-JUGA's timeline is 5 years (2024-2029), not 2 years.  The scheme aims for saturation of gaps but doesn't specify a strict 2-year deadline. Statement 2 is also false; the scheme's funding is drawn from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, not from newly allocated funds.  Statement 3 is correct;  PM-JUGA explicitly includes the promotion of tribal homestays and TMMCs as key components to improve livelihoods and market access for tribal communities.  The incorrect statements provide plausible distractors, requiring precise knowledge of the scheme's funding sources and implementation timeline to accurately answer the question.


**3. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2006 and has 170 signatory countries including India.
2.  The convention defines persons with disabilities as those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, but excludes those with temporary impairments.
3. The convention focuses solely on the rights related to employment and education for persons with disabilities, with limited scope for other social rights.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while India is a signatory, the convention entered into force in 2008, not 2006 and it has 184 not 170 signatory countries. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the UN-CRPD's definition of disability encompasses long-term impairments, but it doesn't explicitly exclude those with temporary impairments. The focus is on long-term limitations but temporary conditions might be considered depending on the impact and duration. Statement 3 is false; the UN-CRPD's scope extends far beyond employment and education. It addresses a wide range of rights, including access to healthcare, justice, participation in political and public life, and protection from discrimination and violence. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the convention's scope, with carefully constructed distractors making it challenging.


**4. Consider the following statements about the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates:**

1. The NHA estimates are released annually by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) since 2002.
2. The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) prepares the estimates with guidance from the NHA Steering Committee, utilizing the System of Health Accounts, 2011.
3. The NHA estimates exclusively focus on the government's expenditure on healthcare services, excluding private sector contributions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHA estimates have been released by MoHFW since 2013-14, not 2002. The National Health Policy, 2002, envisioned the NHA but its implementation started later. Statement 2 is correct; NHATS prepares the estimates under the guidance of the steering committee and expert group, using the 2011 framework.  Statement 3 is false; the NHA estimates provide a comprehensive picture of India's health financing, including both public and private sector contributions.  The question tests precise knowledge of the NHA's timeline and scope, incorporating plausible distractors to increase difficulty.


**5. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NIRF framework includes only four parameters for ranking educational institutions, excluding the parameter of 'Perception'.
2. The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) is the sole implementing agency of NIRF.
3.  In NIRF 2024 rankings, new categories such as Open Universities and State Public Universities were introduced.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; NIRF uses five parameters, including 'Perception,' for ranking institutions. Statement 2 is also incorrect; while NBA is involved, it collaborates with INFLIBNET Centre in implementing NIRF.  Statement 3 is correct; the 2024 NIRF rankings did introduce new categories for Open Universities and State Public Universities, expanding the scope of the ranking system. This question tests factual knowledge of NIRF's parameters and implementation, again using plausible distractors to increase difficulty.


**6. With reference to Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in higher education, consider the following statements:**

1. RPL is a formal mechanism to assess prior learning from only formal educational settings, excluding non-formal and informal learning.
2.  The primary purpose of RPL is to provide an alternative pathway for students to bypass traditional higher education pathways entirely.
3. The UGC issued draft guidelines for RPL in Higher Education, aiming to integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal education system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; RPL explicitly aims to assess learning from formal, non-formal, and informal sources. Statement 2 is also false; while RPL provides alternative pathways, its main purpose is not to bypass traditional education but to integrate prior learning acquired through diverse means into formal qualifications. Statement 3 is correct; the UGC did indeed release draft guidelines for RPL to integrate various learning experiences into the formal higher education system.  The question tests understanding of RPL's scope and objectives, with distractors designed to challenge accurate recall and comprehension.


**1. With reference to the QS World University Rankings, 2025, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rankings are compiled by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) based on 10 performance indicators.
2.  Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) secured a rank within the top 100 globally.
3.  The rankings include more than 1000 universities from over 100 countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The QS World University Rankings, 2025, uses 9, not 10, performance indicators to assess universities.  The number of indicators is a key detail often overlooked, making this a good distractor in a UPSC-style question.

Statement 2 is correct. IIT-B is explicitly mentioned as the top-ranked Indian institution, securing a rank of 118 in the provided text. This is a factual recall component.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the passage mentions a significant number of participating institutions and countries, it does not provide the precise figures of over 1000 universities from over 100 countries.  This statement is designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between general information and precise numerical data, a crucial skill in analyzing data-heavy UPSC questions.  The inclusion of plausible but inaccurate numbers increases the question's difficulty.


**2. With reference to the University Impact Rankings 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rankings are published by Times Higher Education (THE) and evaluate universities based on their contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
2.  The top-ranked Indian university in this ranking secured a position below the 50th rank.
3.  The rankings include fewer than 50 institutions from India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage clearly states that the University Impact Rankings 2024 are published by THE and assess universities based on their performance across multiple UN SDGs.  This tests straightforward factual recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is stated as the top-ranked Indian university, achieving a rank of 81st.  This creates a subtle but significant numerical difference to mislead candidates who might remember the general position but not the exact rank.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions that India is the most-represented country with 96 institutions in the overall table. This is a direct contradiction, designed to test the candidate's ability to identify and interpret numerical data precisely.


**3. With reference to the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The regulations aim to establish a framework for foreign universities to set up campuses in India, as envisioned by the National Education Policy 2020.
2.  Only foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) ranked within the global top 200 are eligible to establish campuses under these regulations.
3.  The regulations mandate that all campuses of foreign universities in India must be self-funded without any government support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The regulations are explicitly linked to the National Education Policy 2020 and aim to facilitate the entry of higher-ranked foreign universities. This is direct factual recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The regulations state that FHEIs ranked in the global top 500, either overall or in relevant subject areas, or possessing outstanding expertise, are eligible.  The alteration of the rank threshold (200 instead of 500) serves as a significant distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The regulations do not explicitly exclude government support or mandate self-funding.  The addition of this restrictive condition aims to test the candidate's careful reading and understanding of the nuances of policy regulations.


**4. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  NIRF was launched in 2016 by the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
2.  The NIRF ranking parameters include Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.
3.  IIT Delhi topped the overall category in the NIRF 2024 rankings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NIRF was launched in 2015, not 2016, by the Ministry of Education (then Ministry of Human Resource Development).  The slight alteration in the launch year is a common distractor technique in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately lists the five parameters used in the NIRF ranking system.  This tests direct factual recall.

Statement 3 is incorrect. IIT Madras, not IIT Delhi, topped the overall category for the sixth consecutive time. The substitution of IIT Delhi for IIT Madras is a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge.


**5. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

1.  ANRF was established under the ANRF Act 2022.
2.  The ANRF's funding for the period 2023-2028 includes ₹60,000 crore from private sources.
3.  The Prime Minister chairs the Governing Board of ANRF.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ANRF was established under the ANRF Act 2023, not 2022. A minor change in the year can significantly alter the correctness of the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The funding from private sources is ₹36,000 crore, not ₹60,000 crore.  This numerical discrepancy is designed to test the candidate's ability to accurately recall data.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the Prime Minister chairs the Governing Board of ANRF.  This tests simple factual recall.


**6. With reference to the  Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2025, consider the following statements:**

1. The rankings include over 2,100 universities from more than 110 countries.
2. The Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore is ranked within the top 200 globally.
3. The rankings utilize fewer than 15 indicators to assess universities across five key areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the passage indicates that the rankings include 2,092 universities from 115 countries and territories.  The slight difference in numbers acts as a subtle distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. IISc Bangalore is ranked within the 251-300 bracket, not within the top 200.  This is a key numerical detail that distinguishes between a generally correct understanding and precise knowledge.

Statement 3 is correct. The rankings use 18 indicators, which is fewer than 15.  This numerical manipulation is a common way to create challenging multiple-choice questions.





**1. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2006 and has 170 signatory countries, including India.
2.  The Biwako Millennium Framework is a supplementary document to the UN-CRPD focusing specifically on the Asia-Pacific region.
3. The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties to the UN-CRPD focused on rethinking disability inclusion in the context of the upcoming Summit of the Future.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the UN-CRPD entered into force in 2008, not 2006, and it has 184 States parties not 170. While India is a signatory, the exact number of signatories can fluctuate.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Biwako Millennium Framework works towards an inclusive society for persons with disabilities, it's not a supplementary document to the UN-CRPD; it operates independently, although it aligns with the CRPD's goals.  Statement 3 is correct. The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties did indeed focus on rethinking disability inclusion ahead of the Summit of the Future.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate. The other statements contain inaccuracies regarding dates and the relationship between the UN-CRPD and other frameworks.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA is a 10-year scheme aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in 50,000 villages across India.
2.  The scheme's funding is entirely sourced from a newly allocated budget specifically for this initiative.
3. The scheme includes interventions focused on infrastructure development, skill development, and educational improvements, but does not address healthcare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts: PM-JUGA is a 5-year scheme (2024-29), not 10 years, and it aims to cover approximately 63,000 villages, not 50,000.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the scheme utilizes existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, not a new, separate budget. Statement 3 is incorrect because PM-JUGA explicitly aims to improve healthcare access through initiatives like Ayushman Bharat.  Therefore, all three statements are inaccurate, making (c) the correct answer. The question highlights the importance of precise understanding of the scheme's duration, funding sources, and the scope of its interventions.


**3. With reference to Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in higher education, consider the following statements:**

1. RPL is a mechanism to evaluate knowledge and skills gained only through formal learning pathways and award equivalent academic credits.
2.  The introduction of RPL aims to reduce the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education by streamlining the admission process.
3. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a digital platform directly related to RPL, facilitating the transfer of credits earned through RPL.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because RPL considers knowledge and skills from formal, non-formal, and informal learning pathways, not just formal ones. Statement 2 is incorrect; RPL aims to *increase* GER by allowing individuals with prior learning to access higher education more easily, not reduce it.  Statement 3 is correct. The ABC is indeed designed to store credits earned through various means, including RPL, thus facilitating their transfer and recognition within the formal education system.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the nature and purpose of RPL in higher education.  The incorrect statements highlight potential misunderstandings about the scope of RPL and its impact on GER.


**4. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

1. The ANRF is funded entirely by the central government, with no private sector participation.
2.  The ANRF's primary goal is to establish new universities across the country to expand access to higher education.
3.  The ANRF subsumed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) under its umbrella.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ANRF's funding model involves both central government allocation (₹14,000 crore) and private sector contributions (₹36,000 crore). Statement 2 is incorrect. The ANRF's focus is on fostering research and innovation, not establishing new universities; its primary goal is to cultivate a research culture in existing institutions. Statement 3 is correct. The ANRF did indeed incorporate the SERB into its structure. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate, highlighting the crucial difference between the ANRF's role in research promotion and university establishment.


**5. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NIRF ranking parameters include teaching, learning, research, and outreach but exclude perception and inclusivity.
2. The NIRF 2024 rankings introduced new categories for skill universities and private universities but not for open universities.
3. The Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, topped the overall NIRF 2024 ranking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NIRF ranking explicitly includes perception and inclusivity as key parameters along with teaching, learning, research, and outreach.  Statement 2 is incorrect because while NIRF 2024 did add categories for skill universities and state public universities, it also included a new category for open universities. Statement 3 is incorrect; IIT Madras topped the overall category, while IISc Bangalore topped the Universities category.  Thus, all three statements contain inaccuracies.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the NIRF ranking framework, its parameters, and the results of the 2024 ranking.


**1. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2006 and has 170 signatory countries, including India.
2.  The convention's objective is solely focused on providing financial assistance to individuals with disabilities.
3. The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties to the UN-CRPD focused on rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, not 2006.  The number of signatory countries is also slightly inaccurate; while the provided text mentions 164 signatories, the actual number may vary slightly. The core idea that the convention aims to protect the rights of persons with disabilities and that India is a signatory remains true. Therefore, statement 1 is partially correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD's objective is far broader than just providing financial assistance. It aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. While financial support might be a component of implementing the convention, it's not the sole objective.

Statement 3 is correct. The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties did indeed focus on rethinking disability inclusion in the context of the current international situation and in preparation for the Summit of the Future.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities over a 10-year period, covering approximately 100,000 villages.
2.  The scheme's funding is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds specifically for this initiative.
3.  One of the goals is to improve village infrastructure by ensuring all-weather road connectivity to all tribal villages through PMGSY.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM-JUGA scheme's duration is 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29), not 10.  The number of villages covered is also incorrect; it targets around 63,000 villages, not 100,000.  While the overall aim to improve socio-economic conditions is accurate, the specifics of duration and coverage are inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The scheme utilizes existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It does not involve newly allocated funds specifically for this initiative.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The scheme does aim to improve infrastructure, including road connectivity through PMGSY (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana). However, it aims to connect ST majority villages, not *all* tribal villages.  The nuance in this statement makes it partially correct, but for the purpose of a MCQ, it is best considered incorrect due to the overstatement.


**3. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA) and Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines 'habitat' to include only the customary habitat of primitive tribal groups within reserved forests.
2.  Odisha has the lowest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and union territories.
3.  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' scheme provides 100% central assistance, primarily in the form of grants-in-aid.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FRA's definition of 'habitat' is broader than stated. It includes customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling STs.  The statement incorrectly restricts the definition to only customary habitats and reserved forests.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, the highest among all states and UTs, according to the provided text.

Statement 3 is correct. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' scheme does provide 100% central assistance in the form of grant-in-aid and creation of capital assets.


**4. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

1. ANRF was established under the ANRF Act 2024, and the erstwhile Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) continues to operate independently.
2.  The ANRF's funding is entirely sourced from the central government budget.
3.  One of ANRF's key initiatives, "Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)", focuses solely on research in Information Technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ANRF was established under the ANRF Act 2023, and the erstwhile SERB is subsumed into ANRF.  The statement incorrectly states that SERB continues to operate independently.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ANRF's funding is a combination of central government funding (₹14,000 crore) and private sources (₹36,000 crore) for the period 2023-2028.  The statement incorrectly suggests that funding is solely from the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Live-in relationships are not explicitly governed by a specific Act in India.  Their legal standing has evolved through various Supreme Court judgments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court has ruled that children born from live-in relationships *do* have the right to inheritance, as seen in the *Bharatha Matha vs R Vijay Renganathan & Ors* (2010) case.

Statement 3 is correct.  The *Indra Sarma v. VKV Sarma* (2013) judgment did affirm that a consensual live-in relationship between unmarried adults is not illegal.


**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), consider the following statements:**

1.  Aadharshila, launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, is a 48-week curriculum designed for children aged 3 to 6 years.
2.  The curriculum includes a weekly play calendar with a four-week initiation phase focusing solely on free play to ease children's transition from home to the anganwadi center.
3.  The framework for Aadharshila guides engagement exclusively at Anganwadi centers and not within the home environment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aadharshila, a national curriculum for ECCE, is indeed a 48-week program designed for children aged 3-6 years, as accurately described in the provided text.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Aadharshila does incorporate a weekly play calendar with a four-week initiation phase, it's misleading to say this phase focuses *solely* on free play. The curriculum includes academic activities designed to help children transition smoothly from home to the anganwadi center, integrating both structured and free play. The question attempts to create a false dichotomy, making the statement inaccurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The framework for Aadharshila, while primarily focusing on anganwadi centers, explicitly mentions guiding engagement *both* within the home and at these centers.  This demonstrates a crucial aspect of holistic child development, encompassing the child's entire environment. The statement omits this vital detail, making it incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education, consider the following statements:**

1.  RPL is a formal mechanism evaluating prior knowledge, skills, and experience gained through formal learning only.
2.  The primary purpose of RPL is to seamlessly integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal education system through assessments and certifications.
3.  The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education for the 18-23 age group increased to 28.4 in 2021-22, showing a significant increase from 2014-15, while the female GER increased to 28.5 during the same period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RPL assesses knowledge, skills, and experience from *formal, non-formal, and informal* learning pathways.  The statement's restriction to formal learning alone is a key error.

Statement 2 is correct. The core aim of RPL is to formally acknowledge and integrate knowledge gained outside traditional educational settings into the formal education system, thus providing certification and credit for these experiences.

Statement 3 is correct. The provided text accurately states the increase in both overall and female GER in higher education between 2014-15 and 2021-22, reflecting positive trends in access to higher education.  The numbers are correctly presented. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NIRF uses the five parameters mentioned in the text, it's inaccurate to state that there are six.  The addition of "Innovation" as a separate parameter is a deliberate error to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the NBA assesses qualitative competence and collaborates with INFLIBNET, the statement incorrectly limits the NBA's assessment to engineering and technology. The text clearly indicates that the NBA assesses various disciplines, including management, pharmacy, and architecture.

Statement 3 is correct.  The provided text accurately reflects the 2024 NIRF ranking results, including the top institutions and the addition of new ranking categories.  Only this statement is entirely accurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The news item regarding the approval of habitat rights for the Juangs and Mankidia tribes in Odisha serves as a real-world example of the District Level Committee's role in this process.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was repealed in 1949, and the term "criminal tribes" was denotified in 1952. The statement incorrectly implies its continued existence and impact, making it false.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**7. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  DNTs are a homogenous group primarily engaged in agriculture and traditional crafts.
2.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are approximately 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and 198 DNTs, comprising 15 crore Indians.
3.  The Idate Commission (2017) recommended the immediate repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act by respective states due to its potential for harassment of DNT members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NADA does indeed have an anti-doping helpline to provide information and guidance to athletes and support personnel regarding anti-doping rules and regulations.  This is a crucial aspect of their work in promoting clean sport.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NADA does participate in the commemoration of WADA's Play True Day,  it is not solely a NADA campaign; it's a global initiative by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).  The campaign is a collaborative effort, not solely owned or launched by NADA.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, is a separate piece of legislation dealing with narcotics. While substance abuse is relevant to anti-doping, this Act itself does not govern NADA's operational framework. NADA's operations are primarily governed by the National Anti-Doping Rules, which align with the World Anti-Doping Code.

1. The report, launched by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP, exclusively focuses on food waste generated in high-income countries, neglecting data from low and middle-income nations.
2. The Food Waste Index (FWI) tracks global and national food waste generation only at the production level, excluding retail and consumer levels.
3. The report provides data on both edible and inedible parts of food wasted at retail and consumer levels (household and food service).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report explicitly tracks global and national food waste, encompassing data from various income levels. The statement falsely restricts the report's geographical scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FWI tracks food waste across the entire supply chain, including production, retail, and consumer levels (household and food service). The statement wrongly limits its scope to just production.

Statement 3 is correct. The report accurately tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels, encompassing both edible and inedible parts. This aligns directly with the information provided about the report's content.  This detail is crucial to understanding the report's comprehensive nature.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC regulations stipulate that foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) must be ranked within the global top 500 (either overall or in relevant subject areas) or possess exceptional expertise in a specific field to establish campuses in India.  The top 100 is not the sole criterion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UGC initially provides in-principle approval and issues a Letter of Intent (LoI).  Final approval is not immediate; it follows a more comprehensive assessment and the fulfillment of conditions outlined in the LoI, including the establishment of the campus within a stipulated timeframe (two years).

Statement 3 is correct. The regulations explicitly allow for collaborations between two or more FHEIs to set up campuses in India, provided each institution independently meets the eligibility criteria.  This collaborative approach encourages the sharing of resources and expertise.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, not 2007 and 2009 respectively. Precise dates are important for demonstrating attention to detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD has a broader definition of persons with disabilities, encompassing those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments.  This inclusive definition is a key aspect of the convention's approach.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India is a signatory to the UN-CRPD.  Understanding India's commitment to international human rights conventions is crucial for UPSC preparation.  Knowing which conventions India has signed and ratified showcases awareness of international relations.


**5. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following statements:**

2. The Act defines sexual harassment solely based on physical contact.
3. The ICC's presiding officer must be a male employee at a senior level.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The POSH Act requires an ICC in organizations with ten or more employees, not five.  The number of employees is a key threshold for triggering the Act's requirements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The POSH Act defines sexual harassment more broadly than just physical contact. It incorporates various forms of unwelcome behavior, including verbal, non-verbal, and visual conduct of sexual nature.  Understanding the comprehensive nature of the definition is crucial.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The POSH Act mandates that the presiding officer of the ICC must be a woman employed at a senior level.  This ensures gender sensitivity and appropriate representation in addressing complaints.  The gender of the presiding officer is a crucial detail.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FWI tracks food waste at both retail *and* consumer levels (household and food service). The statement omits the retail component of the tracking.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the FWI does support SDG 12.3, it supports 12.3.1(b), not 12.3.1(a).  SDG 12.3.1(a) relates to food loss along production and supply chains (FAO is the custodian), while 12.3.1(b) focuses on halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels (UNEP is the custodian). The statement confuses the two indicators.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report's findings show that households wasted *over* 1 billion meals a day in 2022, significantly more than the figure stated.  This is a substantial misrepresentation of the report's data.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PHIE as a percentage of THE *increased* to 7.4% from 5.8%.  The statement wrongly indicates a decrease.

Statement 3 is incorrect. External/Donor funding for health as a percentage of THE *increased* to 1.1% from 0.5%. The statement incorrectly indicates a decrease.  All three statements misrepresent the directional changes in the given percentages.


**10. With reference to euthanasia and the draft guidelines released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, consider the following statements:**

1. The guidelines pertain to active euthanasia, which involves actively ending a patient's life through direct action.
2. The guidelines mandate the constitution of a single medical board to review proposals for withdrawing life-sustaining treatments.
3. Karnataka is the first state in India to allow terminally ill patients to die with dignity, in line with Supreme Court directives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The guidelines pertain to *passive* euthanasia, involving the withdrawal of life support, not active euthanasia, which involves direct action to end a life.  The distinction between active and passive euthanasia is crucial.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The guidelines mandate the constitution of *two* medical boards—a Primary Medical Board (PMB) and a Secondary Medical Board (SMB)—to review proposals for withdrawing life-sustaining treatments.  The statement understates the number of boards involved.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Kerala, not Karnataka, was the first state to allow terminally ill patients to die with dignity, in line with Supreme Court directives; Karnataka was the second. The statement misrepresents the chronological order of state-level implementation.


**1. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a wide geographical spread or a high risk thereof, exceeding or potentially exceeding national health system response capabilities.  
2.  A new States Parties Committee is established to ensure effective IHR implementation, replacing the existing WHO advisory bodies.
3. The amendments mandate the creation of a global reserve fund to provide immediate financial support to all countries facing health emergencies, regardless of their income level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendments to the IHR, 2005, significantly redefine pandemic emergencies, focusing on the strain on national health systems and the potential for widespread geographical impact. This reflects the lessons learned from recent outbreaks like COVID-19.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the amendments do establish a States Parties Committee, it's not a replacement for existing WHO advisory bodies; rather, it's an addition designed to enhance the effectiveness of IHR implementation through improved coordination and accountability among member states.  The existing WHO mechanisms remain operational.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The amendments establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism,  but this is not a global reserve fund accessible to all countries. Its purpose is to address the needs and priorities of *developing* countries, prioritizing those with weaker health systems and limited resources to respond to public health emergencies. This reflects a targeted approach to resource allocation, rather than a universally accessible fund.  The mechanism aims to improve equitable access to resources for effective pandemic response, particularly in nations most vulnerable to health crises.


**2. With reference to the SPARSH digital pension system, consider the following statements:**

1. SPARSH is designed exclusively for serving defence pensioners residing in urban areas, providing doorstep delivery of pension benefits.
2.  The system is managed by Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) selected from among veterans or their Next of Kin (NOKs) by respective Local Military Authorities (LMAs).
3.  SPARSH aims to streamline pension-related processes, providing accessible facilitation points for veterans and NOKs nationwide.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  SPARSH aims for nationwide coverage, including both urban and rural areas, to ensure accessibility for all eligible defence pensioners. Its focus is on streamlining processes and providing accessible facilitation points, not just doorstep delivery in urban areas.

Statement 2 is correct.  The management structure of SPARSH relies on VLEs selected from veterans or their NOKs by the LMAs, ensuring local expertise and community engagement in the system's operation.

Statement 3 is correct. The primary goal of SPARSH is to simplify pension procedures and increase access to services for veterans and their families throughout India.  This includes establishing easily accessible facilitation points to assist with pension-related queries and processes.


**3. With reference to the National Medical Register (NMR) portal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMR is mandated under Section 32 of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, and includes all registered healthcare professionals, irrespective of their specialization.
2. The portal is linked to the Aadhaar ID of doctors to verify their identity and prevent fraudulent registrations.
3.  The NMR facilitates interlinking of State Medical Councils (SMCs), aiding in the verification of medical registrations across states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMR is indeed mandated under the NMC Act, 2019, but specifically Section 31, not Section 32.  Furthermore, the register currently focuses on allopathic (MBBS) registered doctors, not all healthcare professionals.

Statement 2 is correct.  The integration with Aadhaar IDs is a crucial component of the NMR, aimed at enhancing security and preventing identity fraud.  This ensures the authenticity of registered medical practitioners.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NMR's design facilitates the interconnection of SMCs, streamlining the verification process for medical registrations across different states in India, promoting greater efficiency and accuracy in maintaining the national register.

1. PM-JUGA focuses solely on providing financial assistance to individual tribal households, promoting entrepreneurship and self-reliance.
2.  The scheme aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods through convergence of various existing schemes.
3. PM-JUGA is funded entirely through newly allocated funds specifically earmarked for the scheme, independent of other existing development programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-JUGA adopts a holistic approach, focusing on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing multiple aspects of their development, not just financial aid to individual households.  It incorporates infrastructure development, health initiatives, educational improvements, and livelihood enhancement programs.

Statement 2 is correct. The scheme's core objective is to bridge critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood opportunities for tribal communities through a convergent approach, utilizing and coordinating existing government schemes and resources.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PM-JUGA leverages funding from existing sources, primarily the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It doesn't rely on newly allocated, independent funds.  The scheme's effectiveness relies on strategic coordination and efficient utilization of existing resources rather than the creation of a completely new funding stream.


**5. With reference to the  Global Gender Gap Report 2024 and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 shows that India has improved its ranking compared to the previous year's report.
2. The GII 2022 uses a scoring system where a lower score indicates higher gender inequality.
3. Both reports use identical methodologies and indicators to measure gender inequality across countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 indicates a decline in India's ranking compared to the 2023 report.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The GII 2022 uses a scoring system where a *lower* score indicates *lower* gender inequality. A score closer to 0 represents greater gender equality.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Report and the GII utilize different methodologies and indicators to assess gender inequality. While both aim to measure gender parity, they employ distinct approaches and frameworks.  They cover different aspects of gender inequality, leading to different rankings and conclusions.  The GGGI, for example, employs 14 indicators across four dimensions, while the GII employs a different set of indicators and calculations.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities through convergence of different schemes.
2.  The Abhiyan's funding is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds specifically for this initiative.
3. PM-JUGA covers approximately 63,000 villages benefiting over 5 crore tribal people, with a 5-year tenure (2024-25 to 2028-29).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA's core objective is to address critical deficiencies in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood opportunities within tribal communities. This is achieved by integrating and synergizing various existing government schemes, rather than creating entirely new ones.  The convergence approach maximizes resource utilization and ensures comprehensive development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Abhiyan utilizes funds from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It doesn't involve the allocation of entirely new, dedicated funds. This is a crucial aspect of the program's fiscal strategy – leveraging pre-existing resources for efficient implementation.

Statement 3 is correct. The Abhiyan's scope encompasses around 63,000 villages, impacting over 5 crore tribal individuals.  The program is planned for a five-year duration, from 2024-25 to 2028-29, allowing for phased implementation and measurable progress over time.  This long-term perspective is essential for sustainable and impactful community development.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Dhebar Committee (1960-61) identified 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory, with Odisha having the highest number.
2. Criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural existence, a consistently increasing population, high literacy rates, and a market-driven economy.
3. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central assistance, focusing on comprehensive socio-economic development while preserving cultural heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Dhebar Committee's recommendations resulted in the identification of 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory in India. Odisha stands out with the highest number of PVTGs among all the states and UTs.  This highlights the diversity of tribal populations and the unique challenges faced by these groups in different regions of the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods and pre-agricultural existence. However, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy rates, and a subsistence economy are also key characteristics.  The statement incorrectly presents the opposite of these crucial indicators.

Statement 3 is correct. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central funding.  Its objective is to promote the socio-economic development of PVTGs while safeguarding their unique cultural heritage and traditions.  The scheme's focus on holistic development is a critical aspect of government policy aimed at addressing the specific needs of these vulnerable communities.


**3. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024, launched by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), tracks global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels.
2. The FWI supports SDG 12.3.1 (b), aiming to reduce per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 25% by 2030.
3.  According to the report, households across all continents wasted less than 500 million meals daily in 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FWI does track global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels, it is launched by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme), not the FAO.  The FAO is responsible for a different SDG indicator related to food loss. This highlights the division of responsibilities among different UN agencies in addressing food security issues.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misrepresents the target.  The FWI does indeed support SDG 12.3.1 (b), which aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030, not reduce it by 25%. This difference in the stated target is a significant detail.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The report actually indicates that households across all continents wasted *over* 1 billion meals a day in 2022, a significantly higher figure than what is stated.  This error in the quantity drastically alters the understanding of the scale of the problem highlighted by the report.


**4. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHA estimates are released annually by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) since 2013-14, as envisioned in the National Health Policy, 2012.
2. The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) prepares the estimates with guidance from the NHA Steering Committee and uses the System of Health Accounts, 2001.
3. The NHA provides a comprehensive overview of financial flows within India’s health system, including fund collection sources, spending across the healthcare sector, and healthcare service utilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NHA estimates are released by the MoHFW and provide a valuable overview of India's healthcare financing, the release began in 2013-14, and they are envisioned in the National Health Policy, 2002, not 2012. This seemingly minor inaccuracy in the year represents a misunderstanding of the policy timeline.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NHATS prepares the estimates with guidance from the NHA Steering Committee and Expert Group.  Importantly, it uses the System of Health Accounts, 2011, not 2001.  The difference in the year reflects a crucial update in the accounting framework.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NHA estimates offer a detailed and comprehensive analysis of India's health financing landscape.  It meticulously tracks fund sources, spending patterns across various healthcare sectors, and the utilization of healthcare services.  This makes it an indispensable tool for policymakers and researchers seeking to understand and improve the efficiency and equity of the Indian healthcare system.


**5. With reference to the Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The 76th annual World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting finalized amendments to the IHR, 2005, addressing shortcomings highlighted by the Ebola and COVID-19 outbreaks.
2. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread or high risk thereof, exceeding national health system response capabilities.
3. The amendments establish a State Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation and create regional IHR Authorities to improve coordination among countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments were finalized during the 77th, not the 76th, annual World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting. This is a critical factual error, as it relates directly to the timing and context of the legal changes.

Statement 2 is correct.  The revised definition of a pandemic emergency accurately reflects the challenges posed by widespread communicable diseases that overwhelm national health systems.  This precise definition is crucial for triggering international cooperation and resource mobilization.

Statement 3 is partially correct, but the last part is incorrect. The amendments do establish a State Parties Committee. However, they create *National*, not regional, IHR Authorities to strengthen national coordination and international collaboration. The distinction between national and regional is important for understanding the structure of the amended regulations.  The creation of national authorities is designed to improve each country's internal response capacity.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  The Dhebar Committee's recommendations led to the recognition of 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory.
2.  Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and Union Territories.
3.  Criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural existence, and a rapidly growing population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dhebar Committee (1960-61) indeed recommended the recognition of 75 PVTGs, which were subsequently identified across 18 states and one UT.  Statement 2 is also correct; Odisha houses the largest number of recognized PVTGs.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. One of the criteria for identifying PVTGs is a *stagnant or declining* population, not a rapidly growing one, reflecting their vulnerability and often marginalization.  A growing population would not typically be a characteristic associated with PVTGs.  The other criteria (forest-based livelihoods and pre-agricultural existence) are accurate.


**2. With reference to Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines "habitat" as the area encompassing customary habitats within reserved and protected forests exclusively for primitive tribal groups.
2.  The granting of habitat rights involves a process of consultation with relevant stakeholders.
3.  The Bharias tribe in Madhya Pradesh and the Maria Gond tribe in Maharashtra are among those who have been granted habitat rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the FRA does define habitat, it includes not only primitive tribal groups but also pre-agricultural communities and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.  Statement 2 is correct; the FRA mandates consultation with stakeholders before granting habitat rights. Statement 3 is also correct; the Bharias of Madhya Pradesh and the Maria Gond of Maharashtra are among the tribes that have received habitat rights under the FRA.


**3. Consider the following statements about Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, enacted during the British Raj, led to the categorization of certain communities as "born criminals."
3.  The Supreme Court's judgment in the Sukanya Santha case upheld the caste-based discrimination within prisons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; the two categories are distinct, though there might be some overlap. Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was a discriminatory piece of legislation that labelled certain groups as inherently criminal.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's judgment in the Sukanya Santha case *struck down* caste-based discrimination within prisons, deeming it unconstitutional.


**4. With reference to the 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme aims for the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs while preserving their unique cultural heritage.

3.  The scheme's approach involves formulating Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans at the micro level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The scheme explicitly aims at holistic development while respecting the cultural identity of PVTGs. Statement 2 is incorrect; the scheme is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with 100% Central assistance (both grants and capital asset creation). Statement 3 is correct.  The scheme utilizes a micro-planning approach through CCD plans.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024:**

1. The GHI 2024 indicates that hunger levels in a majority of countries are at alarming levels, jeopardizing the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030.
2. India's ranking improved in the GHI 2024 compared to the previous year.
3.  The GHI report highlights the strong correlation between gender equality and hunger levels, with women and girls disproportionately affected.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GHI 2024 report indeed shows alarming hunger levels in many countries, making the 2030 Zero Hunger goal challenging. Statement 2 is also correct; India's GHI ranking improved in 2024 compared to 2023. Statement 3 is correct. The report strongly emphasizes the link between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, particularly highlighting the vulnerability of women and girls.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The VRF is indeed a fund to address various vulnerabilities, including those related to food, health, and natural calamities. Statement 2 is incorrect. While VRF often benefits vulnerable groups including Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, it is not exclusively limited to them.  The fund's scope is broader to encompass various vulnerable populations. Statement 3 is incorrect. VRF funding is not solely managed by local NGOs; it involves government agencies and potentially other organizations depending on the specific implementation context.  The management structure is not uniformly restricted to NGOs.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Dhebar Committee, in 1960-61, recommended the identification of 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory, with Odisha having the highest number (13).
2.  Criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, a pre-agricultural level of existence, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy.  
3. The ‘Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)’ Scheme, a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central assistance, aims for comprehensive socio-economic development while preserving PVTGs' culture and heritage, focusing on education, housing, and infrastructure development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect information regarding PVTGs.

1. PM-JUGA, named after Birsa Munda ("Dharti Aaba"), aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods through convergence and outreach of various schemes.
2. The scheme draws upon the learnings and successes of the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN).
3. PM-JUGA's funding is solely derived from newly allocated funds specifically designated for the initiative, independent of existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. PM-JUGA's objective and its connection to PM-JANMAN's learnings are accurate. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  PM-JUGA utilizes existing DAPST grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes as its funding source, not entirely from newly allocated funds. This represents a crucial detail that differentiates it from a completely new funding initiative.


**3. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines "habitat" as encompassing customary habitats and other habitats within reserved and protected forests specifically for primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes (STs).
2.  The Odisha government has granted habitat rights to seven tribal groups, including the Paudi Bhuyans of Deogarh, Saora tribals of Gajapati, and Juangs of Keonjhar and Jajpur districts, but excludes the Mankidia tribe.
3.  The process of granting habitat rights under the FRA involves a single, centralized decision-making process by the state government, without any consultation with local stakeholders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely accurate. The FRA's definition of "habitat" as described is correct. Statement 2 is partially incorrect because it wrongly states that the Mankidia tribe is excluded from habitat rights in Odisha; the text clearly includes them as recipients. Statement 3 is completely false; the FRA mandates a sequence of consultations with stakeholders before habitat rights are granted. The incorrect information in statements 2 and 3 makes them unreliable.


**4. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The NIRF, launched in 2015, ranks educational institutions based on five parameters: Teaching, Learning, and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception, excluding Innovation ranking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments to the IHR, 2005, define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with *wide* geographical spread or a high risk of such spread, exceeding national health system response capabilities. The statement incorrectly uses "limited" instead of "wide."

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The established coordinating financial mechanism aims to address the needs and priorities of *developing* countries, acknowledging their often-limited resources in handling public health emergencies.  The statement misrepresents the target beneficiaries.

Statement 3 is partially correct in stating the creation of National IHR Authorities. However, the implication that these authorities only enhance international coordination and not domestic coordination is inaccurate.  These authorities are intended to improve coordination *both* domestically and internationally to ensure a more effective and unified response to public health crises. Therefore, the entire statement is considered incorrect.


**2. With reference to the Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NSP 2024 aims to integrate sports with education through alignment with NEP 2020, it does *not* prioritize elite athlete development over grassroots participation.  In fact, a significant focus is on developing a broader sporting culture and participation at all levels.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the policy does aim to leverage sports for economic development, it specifically mentions boosting industries such as tourism and manufacturing, not traditional sports industries like fishing and agriculture.  The statement misrepresents the targeted industries.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The policy does indeed introduce a National Fitness Ranking & Indexing system and *also* includes provisions for promoting indigenous games as part of its focus on social development through sports. The statement wrongly claims the policy excludes promotion of indigenous games.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report defines financing for food security and nutrition to include *both* public and private financial resources, both domestic and foreign, directed towards eradicating hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition. It also encompasses utilization and stability of food, along with strengthening agrifood systems resilience. The statement is overly restrictive in its definition of financing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report explicitly states that the world is *far off track* to achieve SDG 2, Zero Hunger.  The statement misrepresents the report's findings on progress towards Zero Hunger.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report indicates that 1 in *11* people faced hunger globally in 2023, not 1 in 10.  The statement provides an inaccurate statistic.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 by the WEF indeed reported a 68.5% closure of the global gender gap, with Iceland, Finland, and Norway leading.  The report uses a Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) based on various indicators across four dimensions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GII 2022 by UNDP does use a 0-1 scale as described,  the provided text states that India's rank *worsened* in 2022 compared to 2021 (108th vs. 122nd), not improved.  The lower the GII score, the lower the gender inequality.

Statement 3 is correct.  Both reports underscore the ongoing struggle for gender equality. The GGGI's projections show that at the current rate, achieving full gender parity will take a considerable amount of time (134 years according to the given text). The GII also reflects this ongoing disparity by assigning ranks based on gender inequality across different nations.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, while focusing on policy instruments, also emphasizes building partnerships and mobilizing financial *and knowledge* resources.  It operates on three pillars—National, Financial, and Knowledge—demonstrating a broader approach than solely financial mobilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition explicitly aims to address undernutrition in children, along with other forms of malnutrition.  The statement falsely claims it excludes undernutrition in children.

Statement 3 is correct. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, accurately focuses on financing for food security and nutrition, encompassing both domestic and foreign, public and private resources.  It also correctly emphasizes strengthening the resilience of agrifood systems as crucial for achieving sustainable food security.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The ANRF's funding model involves a combination of central government and private sector contributions. The text specifies ₹14,000 crore from the Centre and ₹36,000 crore from private sources.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that the Prime Minister chairs the Governing Board, with the Union Ministers of Science and Technology and Education serving as ex-officio Vice-Presidents.


**4. With reference to the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in higher education in India, consider the following statements:**

1. RPL aims to integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal education system by offering a pathway for students to directly earn a postgraduate degree based solely on their prior experience.
2.  The UGC's draft guidelines for RPL focus on providing assessments and certifications for skills gained through formal, non-formal, and informal learning, thereby improving the GER in higher education.
3.  The implementation of RPL is expected to significantly reduce the overall duration required to complete a bachelor's degree, potentially shortening it to just one year.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RPL provides a pathway to integrate prior learning into formal education, but it doesn't directly grant postgraduate degrees.  It involves assessments and certifications that can lead to credit transfer towards formal qualifications, including undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, but not automatically.

Statement 2 is correct. The UGC's draft guidelines aim to integrate informal and non-formal learning through assessments and certifications, which could indirectly contribute to an improved GER over time by allowing more individuals to access higher education.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While RPL might allow for faster progression through a degree program by recognizing prior learning, it wouldn't reduce a bachelor's degree to just one year.  The NEP mentions multiple exit options, which could lead to faster completion for some, but not a universal reduction to one year.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, indicates that the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 is attainable based on current global trends.
2. India's GHI score improved significantly in 2024, moving from the "serious" to the "moderate" category, reflecting substantial progress in child nutrition.
3.  The GHI report highlights the link between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, emphasizing that women and girls are disproportionately affected by food insecurity and malnutrition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 report actually indicates that hunger levels in many countries are alarming, making the 2030 Zero Hunger goal unattainable based on current trends. The global score is mentioned as "moderate," but this doesn't mean the goal is achievable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's ranking improved from 111th to 105th, but it still remains in the "serious" category. While there has been some improvement, the report notes that child wasting and stunting remain high.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI report explicitly highlights the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, and emphasizes the disproportionate impact on women and girls.

3.  Under Goal-2 of PM-JUGA,  the emphasis is on skill development, entrepreneurship promotion, and enhanced livelihoods by primarily focusing on providing financial assistance directly to individuals, bypassing existing skill development programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods by converging existing schemes and learning from PM-JANMAN's success.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. The scheme covers approximately 63,000 villages and benefits over 5 crore tribal people, but the implementation period is 5 years, not 10.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Goal-2 focuses on skill development and livelihood enhancement, it does not bypass existing skill development programs. It utilizes existing initiatives like Skill India Mission and integrates them into its strategy.  The approach is one of convergence and integration, not bypassing established programs.


**7. With reference to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in Odisha, consider the following statements:**

1.  Habitat rights for PVTGs are granted under Section 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA).
2. The District Level Committee in Odisha recently approved habitat rights for the Juangs of Keonjhar and Mankidia tribes, who are classified as PVTGs.
3. The FRA provides PVTGs with the right to free education up to the secondary level, but does not include any reservation provisions in government jobs or higher education institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only

1. The National Policy for PwDs, 2006, mandates that at least 10% of the workforce in the private sector must constitute PwDs.
2. The Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) focuses solely on improving physical accessibility in public spaces, neglecting digital accessibility.
3. The concept of "Limited Guardianship" allows for joint decision-making between a guardian and a PwD, respecting the PwD's will and limited to specific decisions and situations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Policy for PwDs, 2006, encourages private sector participation but doesn't mandate a specific percentage (10%) of PwDs in their workforce. It suggests incentivizing employers to employ PwDs but doesn't enforce a quota.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Accessible India Campaign aims to improve both physical and digital accessibility.  The focus is on creating a barrier-free environment across various aspects of life.

Statement 3 is correct. The text describes Limited Guardianship as a joint decision-making process that respects the PwD's wishes and is applied in specific contexts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NIRF 2024 introduced new categories for Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities, not solely private universities.  The expansion reflects a broader aim to rank diverse types of institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the five parameters are correctly listed, the statement incorrectly implies a significant emphasis on financial resources.  The NIRF framework considers a balanced set of parameters, not prioritizing financial aspects.

Statement 3 is correct. The text confirms that IIT Madras and IISc Bangalore achieved the top rankings as stated.


**10. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments to the IHR, 2005, agreed upon at the 77th World Health Assembly, primarily focus on strengthening national health systems to respond to communicable diseases within national borders, without addressing international cooperation.
2. The amendments established a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to assist developing countries in addressing public health emergencies, but did not create any new international committees or authorities.
3. A pandemic emergency is now defined as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread or a high risk thereof, exceeding or potentially exceeding national health system response capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments aim to improve international cooperation and preparedness for public health emergencies, not solely focusing on national responses.  The creation of a States Parties Committee and National IHR Authorities directly contradicts this statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Besides the Coordinating Financial Mechanism, the amendments established a States Parties Committee to improve IHR implementation and encouraged the creation of National IHR Authorities for better coordination among countries.

Statement 3 is correct. The text defines a pandemic emergency precisely as stated in the question.

1. ANRF was established under the ANRF Act of 2023, subsuming the erstwhile Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).
2. The ANRF's funding model relies solely on government allocation, aiming for a total of ₹50,000 crore over five years.
3.  The ANRF's "Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)" focuses exclusively on research related to renewable energy sources, excluding other technological domains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) was indeed established under the ANRF Act of 2023, and the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) was integrated into its structure.  This restructuring aimed to streamline and strengthen India's research ecosystem.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ANRF aims to mobilize ₹50,000 crore for the period 2023-2028, this funding is not solely from government sources. A significant portion (₹36,000 crore) is expected to come from private sources, reflecting a public-private partnership approach to research funding. The government's commitment is ₹14,000 crore.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The ANRF's "Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)"  has a broader scope than just renewable energy.

2. The convention's primary objective is solely focused on providing financial assistance to individuals with disabilities.
3. The Biwako Millennium Framework is a separate initiative unrelated to the UN-CRPD's goals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2008, not 2006, and it has 164 signatories, not 174, including India.  The delay between adoption (2006) and entry into force is common for international treaties.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD's objective is far broader than simply providing financial assistance.  It aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. This encompasses various aspects, including legal rights, accessibility, social inclusion, and non-discrimination. Financial aid might be a component of national implementation strategies, but it is not the core objective of the convention itself.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Biwako Millennium Framework is directly related to the UN-CRPD's goals. It complements the convention by outlining practical steps towards creating an inclusive, barrier-free, and rights-based society for people with disabilities, aligning with the broader aims of the UN-CRPD.  It is not a separate, unrelated initiative.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA is a five-year initiative (2024-2029) aiming to benefit approximately 2 crore tribal people across 63,000 villages.
2.  The scheme's funding is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds specifically designated for this program.
3.  The scheme's primary focus is on improving sanitation infrastructure, neglecting other crucial aspects of tribal welfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While PM-JUGA is a five-year initiative (2024-2025 to 2028-2029) and aims to cover approximately 63,000 villages, the number of beneficiaries is estimated to be over 5 crore tribal people, not 2 crore.  This reflects the significant scale of the scheme's intended impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PM-JUGA's funding is not from newly allocated funds but rather utilizes existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  This demonstrates a focus on leveraging existing resources for enhanced impact.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PM-JUGA adopts a holistic approach to tribal welfare, encompassing various aspects beyond sanitation.  It addresses critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence and outreach, reflecting a multi-dimensional strategy for socio-economic development.  Sanitation is one component, but it is not the sole focus.


**4. With reference to the Aadharshila National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), consider the following statements:**

1. Aadharshila is a 24-week curriculum designed for children aged three to five years, primarily focusing on literacy and numeracy skills.
2. The curriculum includes a weekly play calendar but lacks provisions for children with disabilities.
3. The Ministry of Education is the primary implementing agency for Aadharshila.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadharshila is a 48-week, not 24-week, curriculum designed for children aged three to six years, not just three to five. While literacy and numeracy are components, the curriculum emphasizes a holistic approach to development, incorporating play-based learning and other crucial aspects of early childhood education.  The focus extends beyond purely academic skills.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Aadharshila does include a weekly play calendar, and importantly, it specifically includes an age-appropriate screening tool to facilitate the inclusion of children with disabilities.  This demonstrates a commitment to inclusive early childhood education.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), not the Ministry of Education, launched Aadharshila.  This reflects the government's focus on integrating early childhood care and education within the broader framework of women and child welfare programs.  Anganwadis, which fall under the MoWCD, are the primary implementing bodies.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024 ranks India among the top 50 countries globally, indicating a significant improvement in hunger levels.
2. The index highlights the lack of correlation between gender inequality and hunger levels.
3.  The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) is not considered a significant initiative in tackling hunger in India according to the GHI report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 ranked India 105th out of 127 countries, placing it in the "serious" category of hunger, not among the top 50.  This highlights the continued challenges in addressing hunger and malnutrition in the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 explicitly highlights a strong link between gender inequality and hunger.  Women and girls are disproportionately affected by food insecurity and malnutrition, underscoring the need for gender-sensitive approaches to hunger reduction.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The PMGKAY is a significant initiative mentioned in the context of tackling hunger in India.  The GHI report acknowledges various initiatives taken by the government, and the PMGKAY, which provides free food grains, is a key element in these efforts.  The report might analyze its effectiveness, but it certainly doesn't dismiss its significance.


**1. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Food Waste Index (FWI) solely focuses on food waste generated at the production level, excluding retail and consumer levels.
2.  The FWI report indicates that food waste contributes to approximately 5-7% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
3. The UNEP is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct. Statement 1 is incorrect because the FWI tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels (household and food service) in addition to global and national generation of food. Statement 2 is incorrect; the report estimates that food waste generates 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, not 5-7%.  Statement 3 is incorrect as the UNEP is the custodian of the FWI, not the FLI; the FAO is the custodian of the FLI.  The question plays on the similar-sounding indices (FWI and FLI) and their custodians, and uses slightly altered figures to create plausible distractors.


**2. With reference to the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment, consider the following statements:**

1. The NQAS Assessment is exclusively implemented for private healthcare facilities, aiming to improve the quality of private healthcare services.
2. The Spot Food License Initiative is designed to complicate the licensing process for food businesses to ensure greater oversight.
3. The NQAS assessment is based on the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS), which are not digitally monitored.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is false because the NQAS Assessment is launched for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) – public health facilities. Statement 2 is false because the Spot Food License Initiative aims to *simplify* the licensing and registration processes through a pan-India IT platform, not complicate them. Statement 3 is false as the IPHS is a digital platform for real-time monitoring of public health facilities. The question uses contrasting aims and technologies to create confusion.


**3. With reference to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), consider the following statements:**

1. GAIN's recent report focuses on reducing gender inequalities in the education sector.
2. GAIN's report promotes nutrition investments in the manufacturing sector to enhance business resilience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. GAIN's report focuses on nutrition investments in the *agri-food* sector, aiming to reduce gender inequalities and enhance business resilience within that sector, not the education or manufacturing sectors as stated in options 1 and 2.  The question uses related but incorrect sectors to mislead the candidate.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false because the report states that the world is *far off track* to achieve SDG 2. Statement 2 is false because the report includes both public and private financial resources, both domestic and foreign. Statement 3 is false because the report indicates that 1 in 11 people (approximately 9%), not less than 10%, faced hunger globally in 2023. The question uses opposite conclusions and partial truths to create difficult distractors.


**5. With reference to the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), consider the following statements:**

1. The GNAFC was launched in 2012 by the World Bank, the UN's World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
2. The GNAFC's primary objective is to improve the quality of education in crisis-affected regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is false; the GNAFC was launched in 2016 by the European Union, the FAO, and the WFP, not the organizations listed. Statement 2 is false; the GNAFC aims to address the root causes of food crises, not solely focus on education. Statement 3 is false; the GRFC is produced *annually*, not biennially.

1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with only a "wide geographical spread," irrespective of the national health system's response capacity.
2.  A new States Parties Committee is established to ensure effective IHR implementation, replacing the existing WHO emergency committee structure.
3. The amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism primarily focused on developed nations' contributions to global health security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a "wide geographical spread" *or* a high risk of one, and exceeding or potentially exceeding the ability of national health systems to respond. The ability of national health systems to respond is a crucial element of the definition.

Statement 2 is correct. The amendments establish a States Parties Committee to enhance the implementation of the IHR. This committee is responsible for monitoring, reviewing, and coordinating efforts to improve global health security.  It is a new mechanism designed to improve coordination and accountability among member states.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The coordinating financial mechanism established by the amendments is designed to address the needs and priorities of *developing* countries.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While abortion beyond 24 weeks is permitted for foetal abnormalities, it requires the opinion of a *Medical Board* constituted by States/UTs, not just a single RMP.  This reflects the increased complexity and ethical considerations associated with later-term abortions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Abortion up to 20 weeks requires the opinion of only *one* RMP. The requirement for two RMPs applies only to pregnancies between 20 and 24 weeks for specific categories of women as defined in the MTP Rules, 2021.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The original MTP Act, 1971, did establish gestational limits for abortion, though these limits have been subsequently amended. The 2021 amendment significantly expanded access to abortion services by increasing these limits.


**3. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The PWDVA defines domestic violence to encompass only physical and sexual abuse, excluding emotional and economic abuse.
2.  The Act allows complaints to be filed only against the husband of the aggrieved woman, excluding other relatives or partners.
3. The Supreme Court's 2016 ruling in *Hiral P Harsora* expanded the scope of the Act to include all individuals irrespective of gender involved in a domestic relationship with the aggrieved woman.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PWDVA has a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing actual abuse or threat of abuse, whether physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, or economic.  This comprehensive definition aims to address the multifaceted nature of domestic violence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act allows complaints to be filed against any person who is, or has been, in a domestic relationship with the aggrieved woman, including relatives (both male and female) of the husband or male partner. This ensures that a wider range of perpetrators can be held accountable.

Statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court's 2016 ruling in *Hiral P Harsora* struck down the words "adult male" from the definition of the person against whom a complaint could be filed under the PWDVA. This significantly broadened the scope of the Act to include all individuals, regardless of gender, involved in a domestic relationship with the aggrieved woman.


**4. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The POSH Act mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) only in organizations employing 50 or more employees.
2.  The ICC must have at least three members, including the Presiding Officer, with at least half of the members being women.
3.  The Act grants ICCs the powers equivalent to a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, during inquiries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The POSH Act mandates the establishment of ICCs in organizations employing 10 or more employees, not 50. This ensures that a wider range of workplaces are covered by the Act's protective provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. The ICC must have a minimum of three members, including the Presiding Officer, with at least half of the members being women. This ensures gender balance and representation in the decision-making process.

Statement 3 is correct.  The POSH Act grants ICCs the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, during inquiries. This empowers ICCs to effectively investigate complaints, gather evidence, and make recommendations for redressal.



**5. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates 7% reservation for persons with disabilities (PwDs) in government jobs and government-aided higher educational institutions.
2. The Act provides for "limited guardianship" only when a PwD is completely incapable of making any decisions, requiring complete dependence on a guardian.
3.  The Act mandates government programs to ensure an adequate standard of living for PwDs, enabling independent living or community-based living.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act mandates 5% reservation for PwDs in government jobs and government-aided higher educational institutions, not 7%.  While the aim is to promote inclusivity, the actual percentage of reservation is 5%.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Limited guardianship under the Act is a joint decision-making system, not a complete takeover of decision-making power. It is implemented based on mutual understanding and trust between the guardian and the PwD, respecting the PwD's will and being limited to specific decisions and situations.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Act explicitly mandates the government to formulate necessary programs to safeguard the rights of PwDs to an adequate standard of living, enabling them to live independently or within the community. This is a cornerstone of the Act's focus on inclusive living.




**1. With reference to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The IHR, 2005, is a successor to the International Sanitary Regulations of 1961, aiming to establish a legally binding framework for handling cross-border public health emergencies.
2.  Amendments to the IHR, 2005, adopted at the 77th World Health Assembly, include the establishment of a global fund to support developing countries during pandemics and the creation of national IHR authorities to improve coordination.
3.  Liechtenstein and the Holy See are not members of the World Health Organization (WHO) and therefore not bound by the IHR.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IHR (2005) is indeed a successor to the International Sanitary Regulations, aiming to create a legally binding framework for managing public health events with cross-border implications.  The aim is to define countries' rights and obligations in these situations.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The 77th World Health Assembly did agree on amendments to the IHR, which included establishing a coordinating financial mechanism (not necessarily a global fund, but a mechanism to address financial needs) to assist developing countries and creating national IHR authorities to improve coordination among countries.  The amendments aim to enhance preparedness and response to global health crises.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the IHR comprises all 194 WHO Member States, *including* Liechtenstein and the Holy See.  These entities are, therefore, members and subject to the regulations.


**2. With reference to Passive Euthanasia guidelines, consider the following statements:**

1.  The recently released draft guidelines by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare define terminal illness and detail the conditions for withdrawing life-sustaining treatment (LST), strictly adhering to the Supreme Court's directives in the Common Cause vs. Union of India case.
2. The guidelines mandate the establishment of a Primary Medical Board (PMB) with at least three members and a Secondary Medical Board (SMB) to review LST withdrawal proposals, with the SMB having the final decision-making authority.
3. Karnataka and Kerala are the only two states in India that have legalized passive euthanasia, reflecting the Supreme Court's rulings on the right to die with dignity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The draft guidelines released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare do indeed aim to define terminal illness, outline the conditions for LST withdrawal, and comply with Supreme Court precedents set in the Common Cause case.  These guidelines provide a procedural framework for passive euthanasia.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the guidelines do establish both PMB and SMB, the SMB *validates* the PMB's decision; the PMB's consensus is the crucial step before validation by the SMB.  The final authority isn't solely with the SMB.

Statement 3 is correct.  The passage explicitly states that Karnataka and Kerala are the two states that have legally permitted passive euthanasia in accordance with Supreme Court decisions, emphasizing the "right to die with dignity."


**3. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHA estimates, released annually by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare since 2013-14, provide a comprehensive financial overview of India's health system, encompassing funding sources, expenditure patterns, and healthcare service utilization.
2.  The NHA estimates for 2020-21 and 2021-22 revealed a decrease in Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on health as a percentage of total health expenditure (THE), primarily due to reduced government funding of health insurance schemes.
3. The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS), guided by the NHA Steering Committee and Expert Group, prepares the NHA estimates using the System of Health Accounts, 2011, and the National Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2016.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NHA estimates provide a detailed financial analysis of India's health system, covering various aspects from funding sources to service utilization, aligning with the objectives of the National Health Policy, 2002.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the provided text mentions a decrease in SSE as a percentage of THE, it doesn't attribute this solely to reduced government funding of health insurance schemes.  Other factors could contribute to the decrease. The statement oversimplifies the complex factors influencing the change in SSE.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text clearly outlines the preparation process of the NHA estimates, emphasizing the role of NHATS, the steering committee, the expert group, and the guidelines used in the process.


**4. With reference to the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, consider the following statements:**

1. Launched at the G20 Leaders' Summit 2024 in Brazil, the Alliance aims to eradicate hunger and poverty by 2030, directly addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 (No Poverty) and 2 (Zero Hunger).
2.  The Alliance operates through a "Policy Basket," acting as a neutral facilitator to build partnerships and mobilize resources for implementing various policy instruments related to hunger and poverty eradication.
3. India is not a member of the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, as it has its own independent national programs to address hunger and poverty.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Alliance was indeed launched at the G20 summit in Brazil, and its primary goals are to eradicate hunger and poverty, directly aligning with SDGs 1 and 2.  While the text doesn't specify a 2030 deadline, the overall aim is long-term eradication.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Alliance uses a "Policy Basket" approach to facilitate partnerships and resource mobilization to implement policies aimed at achieving its objectives.  This collaborative, facilitative role is a key aspect of its operations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions that 91 countries are members of the Alliance, and India is included in this list.  The statement wrongly asserts India's non-participation.


**5. With reference to the  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods through convergence of existing schemes.
2.  The scheme is funded entirely through newly allocated funds specifically earmarked for this initiative, distinct from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.
3.  PM-JUGA's initiatives include promoting tribal homestays under Swadesh Darshan, supporting sustainable livelihoods for Forest Rights Act (FRA) patta holders, and upgrading government residential schools/hostels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA's core objective is to enhance the socio-economic well-being of tribal communities by filling critical gaps across various sectors through a convergent approach utilizing existing schemes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that PM-JUGA's funding comes from *existing* DAPST grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It does not involve the allocation of entirely new funds.

Statement 3 is correct.  The passage lists several initiatives under PM-JUGA, including promoting tribal homestays, supporting FRA patta holders, and upgrading educational infrastructure in schools and hostels.  These are all accurate examples of the scheme's actions.


**6. With reference to the  National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Indian Constitution, playing a crucial role in protecting the rights and interests of Scheduled Castes (SCs).
2. The Chairperson and members of the NCSC are appointed by the Prime Minister of India.
3. The NCSC possesses the authority to investigate and issue orders similar to those made by a civil or criminal court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCSC is indeed a constitutional body established under Article 338, tasked with safeguarding the rights and interests of SCs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the President of India, not the Prime Minister, appoints the Chairperson and members of the NCSC.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Delhi High Court ruling, as mentioned in the text, explicitly denies the NCSC the authority to conduct investigations or issue orders with the same power as civil or criminal courts.  Its powers are different and more limited in scope.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (focused on policy and current events), the historical context  required for the "With reference to Indian History..." question type is limited.  Therefore, only question types 1 and 3 are used.


**1. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a "wide geographical spread" or a high risk thereof, exceeding or potentially exceeding national health system response capabilities.  This definition specifically excludes diseases that are easily contained within a single geographic region.
2.  A newly established States Parties Committee will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the IHR amendments, with a strong focus on ensuring compliance by all member states.  The committee's power extends to imposing sanctions on non-compliant nations.
3. The amendments mandate the creation of National IHR Authorities in each member state to streamline communication and coordination during public health emergencies. These authorities will report directly to the WHO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendments to the IHR, 2005, indeed broadened the definition of a pandemic emergency to include communicable diseases with significant geographical spread or a high risk thereof, exceeding national health system response capabilities. The emphasis is on the potential strain on national systems, a crucial aspect often overlooked in previous definitions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the amendments do establish a States Parties Committee to improve IHR implementation, the statement exaggerates its powers. The committee's role is primarily focused on monitoring and facilitating effective implementation, not imposing sanctions.  Sanctions for non-compliance are usually handled through other WHO mechanisms.

Statement 3 is correct. The creation of National IHR Authorities is a key element of the amendments, aiming to improve national-level coordination and communication during public health emergencies.  Direct reporting to the WHO is not explicitly stated in the amendments.


**2. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The PWDVA, enacted under Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution, defines domestic violence to encompass physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse, but specifically excludes instances of marital rape.
2.  The Act mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in all workplaces with 10 or more employees, but these committees lack the power to impose criminal penalties for offenses.
3.  The Supreme Court's decision in the Hiral P Harsora case broadened the scope of the Act by removing the gender restriction on those who can be held accountable, thereby including female relatives in the definition of perpetrators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct in its description of the types of abuse covered under the PWDVA. However, it incorrectly states that marital rape is specifically excluded. While the act does not directly address marital rape as a separate criminal offense, the definition of domestic violence is broad enough to encompass such acts.  The lack of a specific criminal clause for marital rape within the PWDVA remains a point of contention.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PWDVA does mandate ICCs in workplaces with 10 or more employees, but these committees primarily handle complaints through civil remedies, not criminal prosecution. Criminal charges would be pursued through separate legal channels.

Statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court's ruling in the Hiral P Harsora case significantly expanded the scope of the Act by removing the gender-specific limitation on those who can be held responsible for domestic violence, making female relatives also liable.


**3. With reference to the  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD, which entered into force in 2008, aims to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities, including provisions for free education for children aged 6-18.
2.  The convention mandates the establishment of a global fund for the provision of assistive devices to persons with disabilities, ensuring equitable access to such devices regardless of economic status.
3.  The convention promotes the concept of "limited guardianship" as a mechanism to support decision-making for persons with disabilities who cannot make legally binding decisions independently, focusing on a collaborative approach prioritizing the individual's will.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UN-CRPD's primary objective is to ensure full and equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities, and it does advocate for free education for children aged 6-18.  Many signatory countries incorporate this into their national policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD does not mandate a global fund for assistive devices. While it strongly encourages access to assistive technologies, the provision and funding of these devices are typically handled at the national and regional levels through various programs and initiatives.

Statement 3 is correct. The UN-CRPD promotes the concept of "limited guardianship," emphasizing a collaborative and supportive approach to decision-making that prioritizes the individual's autonomy and wishes.  The focus is not on total control by the guardian but on assisting the person with a disability in making informed decisions.


**4. With reference to Passive Euthanasia and the related guidelines, consider the following statements:**

1. The draft guidelines released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare define "terminal illness" and establish procedures for withdrawing life-sustaining treatment (LST), including the formation of a Primary Medical Board (PMB) and a Secondary Medical Board (SMB).
2.  The PMB, composed of at least three members, including the treating physician, is responsible for making the initial determination regarding the withdrawal of LST, while the SMB solely validates the PMB's decision and has no independent decision-making power.
3.  The guidelines mandate that the withdrawal of LST must be based on the written consent of the patient or their legal guardian, obtained preferably within 48 hours of referral to the PMB, and that this consent must be unanimous across all family members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The draft guidelines do indeed define "terminal illness" and outline the procedures for withdrawing LST, including the establishment of PMB and SMB.  The creation of these boards is a key part of the process to ensure due diligence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The information about the composition of the PMB is partially correct, however, the statement incorrectly describes the SMB's role.  The SMB does have independent decision-making power; it is not solely a validation body.  The SMB's role is to independently review and assess the PMB's decision to ensure the process is ethically sound.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While written consent is required, the statement is misleading in requiring unanimous family consent. The guidelines emphasize the patient's autonomy and the need for informed consent; while family input is considered, family unanimity is not a mandatory condition for proceeding.  The emphasis is on the patient's wishes, documented through a living will or expressed through a legal guardian.


**1. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with only a "wide geographical spread," regardless of the national health systems' response capacity.
2. A new Coordinating Financial Mechanism is established to primarily assist developed countries in managing pandemic emergencies.
3. The amendments mandate the creation of National IHR Authorities to solely manage domestic pandemic response, eliminating international collaboration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 is partially incorrect because the amended definition of a pandemic emergency includes both "wide geographical spread" *and* exceeding or potentially exceeding national health systems' response capabilities.  The inclusion of the response capacity element is crucial; a disease could have a wide geographical spread but still be manageable at the national level, not constituting a pandemic emergency requiring international coordination.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the Coordinating Financial Mechanism is explicitly designed to address the needs and priorities of *developing* countries, not developed ones.  Developed nations generally have more robust resources to handle public health crises.

Statement 3 is incorrect as the creation of National IHR Authorities is intended to *improve* coordination among countries, not eliminate international collaboration. Effective pandemic response necessitates both robust national systems and international cooperation to share information, resources, and best practices. The aim is to strengthen national capacities while maintaining a global network for effective response.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024 indicates that hunger levels in only 20 countries are at alarming levels, making the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 attainable.
2. India's GHI score improved significantly in 2024, surpassing the global average and moving out of the "serious" category.
3. The report highlights a strong correlation between gender equality and reduced hunger levels, suggesting that improved gender equality alone can solve global hunger.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 misrepresents the GHI findings; the report actually states that hunger levels are alarming in 42 countries, making the Zero Hunger goal unattainable at the current pace.  The number 20 is a significant misrepresentation of the actual finding.

Statement 2 is false; while India's rank improved slightly from 111th to 105th, it remains in the "serious" category, and its GHI score (27.3) is still considerably higher than the global average. The statement falsely suggests a significant improvement and a change in the severity category.

Statement 3 oversimplifies the complex relationship between gender equality and hunger. While gender inequality exacerbates food insecurity and malnutrition, it is not the sole factor.  Climate change, conflict, poverty, and economic instability also play significant roles and addressing hunger requires a multi-pronged approach considering all these elements. The claim that improved gender equality alone can solve global hunger is a vast oversimplification.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to exclusively focus on infrastructure development in tribal areas, neglecting social and economic aspects.
2.  The scheme utilizes funding solely from newly allocated resources, without leveraging existing development programs.
3. The scheme's name is derived from a historical figure unrelated to tribal resistance movements against British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. PM-JUGA is a comprehensive scheme that aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence of different schemes and outreach. It does not solely focus on infrastructure.

Statement 2 is false because PM-JUGA utilizes funding from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes, indicating a leveraging of existing resources rather than solely relying on new allocations.

Statement 3 is incorrect because the scheme is named after Birsa Munda, a well-known tribal leader who famously led resistance movements against the British Empire, making him a directly relevant figure in the context of tribal empowerment.


**4. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The report finds that food waste at the production level is the primary driver of global greenhouse gas emissions related to food.
2. The report tracks food waste only at the consumer level (household and food service), excluding retail and supply chain losses.
3. The report supports the goals of SDG 12.3 by focusing solely on reducing food losses along production and supply chains.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are inaccurate. Statement 1 is incorrect as the report highlights that food waste generates an estimated 8–10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but it doesn't specify that production-level waste is the *primary* driver.  Other stages, including post-harvest losses, retail, and consumer waste, also contribute significantly.

Statement 2 is false; the report explicitly tracks global and national generation of food waste at retail *and* consumer (household and food service) levels.  It does not exclude retail waste.

Statement 3 misrepresents the report's scope.  While the report supports SDG 12.3, it does so by focusing on *both* reducing food waste at retail and consumer levels (FWI) *and* reducing food losses along production and supply chains (FLI).  It addresses both aspects of SDG 12.3, not solely one.


**5. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The report indicates that only 50% of the global gender gap has been closed in 2024.
2. India's rank improved significantly in 2024 compared to the previous year's ranking.
3. The report highlights that the Health and Survival dimension shows the largest remaining gender gap.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. Statement 1 wrongly states that only 50% of the global gender gap has been closed. The report actually indicates that 68.5% of the global gender gap has been closed in 2024, a significantly higher percentage.

Statement 2 is false. India's rank slightly worsened, moving from 127th to 129th in 2024, indicating a decline rather than an improvement in gender parity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report shows that the Health and Survival gender gap has been largely closed (96%), while other dimensions like Economic Participation and Opportunity have considerably larger remaining gaps.  The statement misrepresents the dimension with the largest remaining disparity.


**1. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency to include only communicable diseases with a demonstrably high mortality rate exceeding 10% of the infected population.
2.  The amendments establish a global fund, managed solely by the WHO, to exclusively finance pandemic preparedness initiatives in high-income countries.
3. The States Parties Committee established by the amendments has the authority to impose sanctions on member states found to be non-compliant with IHR provisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 incorrectly narrows the definition of a pandemic emergency. The amendments broaden the definition to include communicable diseases with wide geographical spread or a high risk thereof, regardless of a specific mortality rate threshold.  Statement 2 is false because the Coordinating Financial Mechanism is designed to address the needs of *developing* countries, not high-income nations, and it's not solely managed by the WHO but involves a collaborative approach. Statement 3 misrepresents the power of the States Parties Committee; while it aims for effective implementation, it doesn't have the authority to directly impose sanctions. The IHR framework relies on cooperation and collaboration, not punitive measures as the primary enforcement mechanism.  The amendments focus on strengthening global health security through improved coordination, surveillance, and resource allocation, not through direct sanctions.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024 reveals that the global hunger level has significantly improved since 2000, exceeding the target of "Zero Hunger by 2030".
2.  India's GHI score improved in 2024, but child wasting and stunting rates remain considerably high, indicating persistent nutritional challenges.
3.  The GHI report explicitly attributes India's improved ranking solely to the success of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI 2024 highlights that hunger levels in many countries are alarming, making the "Zero Hunger by 2030" goal unattainable, and the global score is still considered moderate, not indicative of significant improvement.  While India's ranking improved, it's still in the "serious" category and the persistent high rates of child wasting and stunting are crucial indicators of ongoing nutritional challenges.  Statement 3 is false because the GHI report acknowledges multiple factors contributing to India's situation, including PMGKAY but also other initiatives and underlying issues like maternal malnutrition and the impact of climate change.  Attributing the improvement solely to PMGKAY is an oversimplification.


**3. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

1. ANRF's funding model relies entirely on government allocations, with no private sector involvement.
2. The ANRF is primarily focused on supporting fundamental research in theoretical physics and mathematics.
3. The 'Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)' initiative under ANRF aims to promote research in strategically important sectors like renewable energy and healthcare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect; ANRF's funding model involves a significant contribution from private sources alongside government funding.  Statement 2 is false because while ANRF supports fundamental research, it's not exclusively focused on theoretical physics and mathematics.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; while the UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, it hasn't been ratified by *all* UN member states.  Statement 2 is false because the UN-CRPD's definition of persons with disabilities is broader, encompassing long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments. Statement 3 accurately describes the Biwako Millennium Framework as a key document supporting the implementation of the UN-CRPD's principles in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on inclusive and rights-based approaches.

1. PM-JUGA focuses exclusively on providing financial assistance to tribal communities without addressing infrastructural needs.
2. The scheme's name is inspired by Birsa Munda, a tribal leader who led a movement against British rule.
3. PM-JUGA operates independently of other government schemes and initiatives aimed at tribal development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; PM-JUGA aims for comprehensive development, including improvements in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods through convergence with other schemes.  Statement 3 is false; PM-JUGA is designed to work in conjunction with existing schemes and initiatives, leveraging synergies for greater impact.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the scheme's naming in honor of Birsa Munda, highlighting his historical significance in tribal resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; while the SHA 2011 framework is used, the NHA estimates don't solely rely on annual household surveys. They use a more comprehensive approach, incorporating various data sources. Statement 2 is false; the share of GHE in THE has actually *increased*, not decreased, indicating a greater government role in healthcare funding. Statement 3 is accurate; the OOPE as a percentage of THE has indeed decreased, suggesting a reduction in the financial burden on households for healthcare.


**7.  With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NIRF rankings are solely based on quantitative data, with no qualitative assessment of institutions.
2.  The 2024 rankings introduced new categories for skill universities but not for open universities.

1.  The Dhebar Committee, in its 1960-61 recommendations, identified 75 PVTGs across 17 states and one Union Territory, with Odisha having the highest number.
2.  Criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural existence, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy.  
3. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central assistance, focusing on comprehensive socio-economic development while preserving cultural heritage and utilizing a micro-plan approach through Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Dhebar Committee identified 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory, not 17.  Odisha does indeed house the highest number of PVTGs.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the criteria used to identify PVTGs. These criteria highlight the unique vulnerabilities and socio-economic challenges faced by these groups.

Statement 3 correctly describes the 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, its funding mechanism, objectives, and approach.  The scheme's focus on both development and cultural preservation is a key aspect of its design.  The use of CCD plans for a micro-level approach is also accurate.


**2. With reference to Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines 'habitat' as the area encompassing customary and other habitats in reserved and protected forests exclusively for primitive tribal groups.
2.  The granting of habitat rights involves a multi-stage consultation process with various stakeholders, including government agencies and local communities.
3.  Tribes granted habitat rights include the Paudi Bhuyans of Deogarh, Odisha; the Bharias of Madhya Pradesh; and the Maria Gond of Maharashtra, but excludes the Juangs of Keonjhar district, Odisha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FRA's definition of 'habitat' is broader than stated, encompassing customary and other habitats within reserved and protected forests for primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.  It is not exclusive to primitive tribal groups.

Statement 2 accurately describes the process for granting habitat rights under the FRA.  Extensive consultations are mandated to ensure fairness, transparency, and the inclusion of all relevant stakeholders.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Paudi Bhuyans, Bharias, and Maria Gond are among the tribes granted habitat rights, the Juangs of Keonjhar are explicitly mentioned in the provided text as having received such rights.  The statement incorrectly excludes them.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, indicates that hunger levels in 41 countries are at alarming levels, making the 2030 Zero Hunger goal attainable.
2. India's GHI score improved in 2024, falling into the "serious" category with a score of 27.3, reflecting a decrease in undernourishment.
3.  The GHI report highlights the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, particularly affecting women and girls through food insecurity and malnutrition.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  First, the number of countries with alarming hunger levels is stated as 42, not 41. Second, the report indicates that the 2030 Zero Hunger goal is *unattainable* given the current trends, not attainable.

Statement 2 contains a partially correct and partially incorrect assertion.  While India's ranking did improve (to 105th from 111th), and it did fall into the "serious" category, the provided score of 27.3 is accurate.  The statement is misleading by implying a significant decrease in undernourishment when the report indicates that child wasting and stunting remain high.

Statement 3 correctly reflects a key finding of the GHI report—the strong links between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, and the disproportionate impact on women and girls.


**4. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHA estimates, prepared using the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011, show a decrease in Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP from 2017-18 to 2021-22.
2.  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of THE increased from 40.8% in 2017-18 to 48% in 2021-22, indicating a greater government role in healthcare financing.
3. Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as a percentage of THE increased from 48.8% in 2017-18 to 39.4% in 2021-22.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NHA estimates show an *increase* in THE as a percentage of GDP, not a decrease, from 2017-18 to 2021-22.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the trend in GHE as a percentage of THE, showing an increase signifying a larger government contribution to healthcare financing.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NHA estimates show a *decrease* in OOPE as a percentage of THE from 48.8% to 39.4%, indicating a reduction in out-of-pocket healthcare spending.  The statement reverses this trend.


**5. With reference to Foreign University Campuses in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The University of Southampton is the second international university to establish a campus in India under the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023.
2.  The UGC regulations require foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) to be ranked within the global top 500 overall or in specific subject areas to set up campuses in India.
3.  Campuses of FHEIs in India are permitted to award degrees under their own name and seal, but student mobility and credit transfers are not permitted between the main campus and the Indian campus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the University of Southampton will be the *first* international university to set up a campus in India under the mentioned regulations.

Statement 2 correctly outlines a key criterion under the UGC regulations for establishing foreign university campuses in India. The ranking requirement ensures the quality and reputation of the participating institutions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While FHEIs in India *are* allowed to award degrees under their own name and seal, the regulations explicitly *permit* student mobility and credit transfers between the main campus and the Indian campus, as well as between Indian institutions and the FHEI campus. The statement incorrectly states that these are not allowed.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood in approximately 63,000 tribal villages.
2.  The scheme's funding is exclusively sourced from a newly created, dedicated fund specifically for PM-JUGA.
3. The scheme's duration is initially planned for 3 years, with a possibility of extension based on progress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA explicitly targets improving socio-economic conditions in approximately 63,000 tribal villages by addressing critical gaps across various sectors.  The scheme's comprehensive approach aims to achieve saturation in these areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The scheme utilizes existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It doesn't involve a separate, newly created fund. This is a crucial detail for understanding the scheme's financial mechanism and its integration with existing government programs. The utilization of existing funds highlights the government's focus on efficient resource allocation and avoids unnecessary bureaucratic processes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PM-JUGA has a planned tenure of 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29). The initial timeframe is longer than indicated, reflecting the ambitious and long-term nature of the development goals.  The longer timeframe allows for sustained and impactful interventions, ensuring that the scheme's objectives are adequately addressed within the allocated period.  This long-term perspective is vital for achieving sustainable development in tribal communities.


**2. With reference to the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education, consider the following statements:**

1. RPL exclusively focuses on evaluating skills acquired through formal vocational training programs.
2. The primary purpose of RPL is to provide alternative pathways to higher education for individuals lacking formal schooling.
3.  The UGC's draft guidelines for RPL aim to completely replace traditional degree programs with RPL-based certifications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RPL encompasses the evaluation of knowledge, skills, and experience gained through formal, non-formal, and informal learning pathways. It is not limited to formal vocational training. This broad scope allows for diverse learning experiences to be recognized and credited within the formal education system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While RPL does provide alternative pathways, it aims to integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal education system. It's not meant to entirely replace traditional routes but supplement them, offering increased flexibility and accessibility for learners.  This integration approach enhances the inclusivity of higher education.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UGC's draft guidelines aim to integrate RPL into the existing higher education framework.  It’s not about a complete replacement of traditional degree programs. The integration approach ensures a balanced approach combining traditional learning with RPL, leading to a more comprehensive and flexible education system.


**3. With reference to the Lakhpati Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative aims to create one lakh 'Lakhpati Didis' within five years.
2.  Financial assistance under this scheme includes only direct cash transfers to SHG members.
3.  The initiative is exclusively focused on women in urban areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lakhpati Didi initiative aims to enable three crore Lakhpati Didis, a significantly larger number than one lakh. This ambitious target reflects the scale of the program and its commitment to empowering a substantial number of women.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Financial assistance includes various components such as capitalization support (Revolving Fund and Community Investment Fund), bank loans with interest subvention, overdraft facilities, and the Women Enterprise Acceleration Fund.  The diverse financial support mechanisms ensure a comprehensive approach to economic empowerment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The initiative is part of the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), focusing on rural women. The target group is specifically rural women, highlighting the initiative's focus on addressing socio-economic disparities in rural areas.


**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI 2024 shows that India has improved its ranking significantly compared to the previous year, indicating substantial progress in reducing hunger.
2. The GHI report highlights that child wasting and stunting are significant challenges in India.
3. The GHI report solely focuses on quantitative data, neglecting qualitative aspects of food security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's ranking improved slightly from 111th in 2023 to 105th in 2024, this does not indicate substantial progress. The improvement is marginal within the "serious" category of hunger.  The report still shows significant challenges remain.

Statement 2 is correct. The GHI report clearly highlights that child wasting (18.7%+) and stunting (35.5%+) remain very high in India.  These indicators reflect serious nutritional deficiencies and the need for continued intervention.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the GHI primarily uses quantitative data, the report does acknowledge and discuss the contextual factors influencing hunger, such as gender inequality and climate change.  The report's analysis incorporates a qualitative understanding of the complex issues related to food security.  Therefore, it does not solely rely on quantitative data but utilizes both quantitative and qualitative information for a holistic analysis.


**1. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD was adopted in New York in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, with the objective of promoting, protecting, and ensuring the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.
2.  The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties to the UN-CRPD focused on the theme of "Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future," highlighting the need for a rights-based and inclusive society.
3. The UN-CRPD defines persons with disabilities to include only those with long-term physical impairments, excluding mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UN-CRPD was indeed adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008 with the stated objective of promoting and protecting the rights of persons with disabilities.  This is a core tenet of the convention and widely acknowledged.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 17th session did indeed focus on rethinking disability inclusion, reflecting the ongoing global conversation about implementing the CRPD effectively.  The theme directly addresses the convention's goals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD's definition of "persons with disabilities" is far broader than just those with long-term physical impairments. It explicitly includes those with long-term mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, emphasizing a holistic and inclusive approach to disability.  This is a crucial aspect of understanding the scope and impact of the convention.  The exclusion of these categories fundamentally misrepresents the convention's reach.



**2. With reference to the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA, launched by the Prime Minister, aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by focusing solely on providing pucca houses under PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin).
2.  The scheme is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known as "Dharti Aaba," who resisted the British Empire, and draws upon the learnings and successes of PM-JANMAN.
3. PM-JUGA's funding is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds specifically designated for this scheme, independent of existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PM-JUGA does include providing pucca houses as part of its infrastructure development, it's not solely focused on this aspect. The scheme has a much broader objective encompassing improvements in health, education, and livelihood opportunities for tribal communities, leveraging various existing schemes.  The question attempts to oversimplify the scheme's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The scheme's name and inspiration from Birsa Munda, along with its utilization of learnings from PM-JANMAN, are accurately reflected in the provided information.  This demonstrates an understanding of the scheme's historical context and design.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The funding mechanism for PM-JUGA is explicitly stated to utilize existing DAPST grants.  The statement falsely claims the creation of entirely new funding streams. This is a significant factual inaccuracy that would mislead those unfamiliar with the scheme's details.


**3. With reference to the Lakhpati Didi Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lakhpati Didi initiative, launched in 2023, aims to empower three crore women belonging to Self Help Groups (SHGs) by providing them with annual household incomes exceeding ₹10 lakh.
2. A Lakhpati Didi is defined as an SHG member earning an annual household income of ₹1 lakh or more, calculated over at least four agricultural seasons or business cycles, with an average monthly income exceeding ₹10,000.
3. The initiative exclusively focuses on providing financial assistance through the Women Enterprise Acceleration Fund, offering medium to long-term debt financing to women entrepreneurs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initiative's target is correctly stated as three crore Lakhpati Didis, but the income threshold mentioned is inaccurate; it aims for an annual household income of at least ₹1 lakh, not ₹10 lakh. This subtle but significant difference in the income level makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The definition of a Lakhpati Didi, including the income criteria and calculation methodology, is accurately described. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the initiative's key parameters.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Women Enterprise Acceleration Fund is indeed a component of the financial assistance, the initiative is not limited to this fund alone. It utilizes several other mechanisms, such as capitalization support through Revolving Funds (RF) and Community Investment Funds (CIF), collateral-free bank loans, interest subventions, and overdraft facilities.  The statement incorrectly restricts the financial support to a single avenue.


**4. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates for India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHA estimates, prepared by the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS), are derived using the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 framework but do not consider the National Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2016.
2. In 2021-22,  total health expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP increased, while out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) on healthcare as a percentage of THE decreased compared to previous years.
3.  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) constituted a smaller percentage of THE in 2021-22 compared to 2017-18, indicating a reduced government role in healthcare financing.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHA estimates explicitly state that they are derived using both the SHA 2011 framework and the National Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2016.  The statement omits a crucial part of the methodology, making it inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided data indicates an increase in THE as a percentage of GDP and a decrease in OOPE as a percentage of THE in 2021-22 compared to the 2017-18 figures.  This reflects a trend in healthcare financing.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The data indicates an *increase* in GHE as a percentage of THE from 40.8% to 48%, demonstrating a larger government role in healthcare financing in 2021-22 compared to 2017-18.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual trend shown in the data, making it a significant factual error.


**5. With reference to the PM-YASASVI Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. PM-YASASVI aims to provide streamlined educational support for students from Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Economically Weaker Sections (EWS).
2. The scheme is an umbrella initiative focusing on delivering quality education primarily through scholarships for higher education in engineering and medical fields.
3. The scheme's objective is to enhance educational opportunities for socially and economically disadvantaged students from Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Economically Backward Classes (EBCs), and Denotified Tribes (DNTs).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the scheme aims to help disadvantaged students, it does not include Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) as primary beneficiaries.  This is a crucial omission in the description.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The scheme is not limited to scholarships for higher education in specific fields. It's a broader umbrella scheme focused on providing educational support, not solely through scholarships or for specific disciplines.  The statement is too narrow in its description.

Statement 3 is correct.  The scheme's target beneficiaries are accurately listed as OBCs, EBCs, and DNTs, aligning perfectly with the provided information.  This highlights the specific demographic focus of the scheme.


**1. With reference to anti-doping measures in sports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, adopted in 2005, is solely focused on harmonizing anti-doping rules within national sporting federations.
2. India's anti-doping agency, NADA, solely relies on WADA's Play True campaign for public awareness and education about anti-doping rules.
3.  The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, in India, directly addresses all aspects of doping in sports, including the penalties for athletes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the UNESCO Convention's scope extends beyond national federations; it aims for international harmonization of legislation and regulations to create a level playing field globally.  Statement 2 is also incorrect as NADA employs various strategies beyond the Play True campaign for education and awareness, including helplines and other initiatives.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, is a broader law concerning narcotics and psychotropic substances, not specifically tailored to the nuances of doping in sports. While it might have some overlap, it doesn't comprehensively cover all aspects of sports doping, including the specific rules and regulations governing athletes.  A dedicated anti-doping agency and code are necessary to address the specific issues within the sporting context.  The statement conflates a general drug law with the specific requirements of sports anti-doping.


**2. With reference to multilingualism initiatives in Indian education, consider the following statements:**

1. The Asmita Project, launched by the Union Ministry of Education, aims to produce 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages over a period of 10 years.
2. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is a multilingual dictionary repository developed solely by the University Grants Commission (UGC).
3. The Real-time Translation Architecture initiative focuses exclusively on using cutting-edge technology to translate educational materials into English from Indian languages.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate. Statement 1 is incorrect because the Asmita Project aims to produce 22,000 books in 5 years, not 10.  Statement 2 is incorrect because while the UGC is an implementing agency for Bahubhasha Shabdkosh, it's not the sole developer; the Bharatiya Bhasha Samiti (BBS) is also involved.  Statement 3 is incorrect as the Real-time Translation Architecture aims to enhance translation in both directions – from Indian languages to English and vice-versa, using technology.  The statement misrepresents the scope and direction of the translation initiative.  The question highlights the need for precise knowledge of the specifics of these initiatives, going beyond a general understanding of the goals of promoting multilingualism.


**3. With reference to Project Naman, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Naman, launched by the Indian Army, exclusively focuses on providing financial assistance to the families of deceased veterans.
2. Project Naman utilizes Common Service Centres (CSCs) established solely through the SPARSH system for pension administration.
3. The primary aim of Project Naman is to streamline the pension disbursement process for defence pensioners through digital platforms only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false because Project Naman's scope is broader than just financial aid; it offers comprehensive support and services to defence pensioners, veterans, and their families.  Statement 2 is incorrect because while SPARSH is a key component, the establishment of CSCs is not solely through SPARSH; it involves a wider infrastructure setup.  Statement 3 is false because while digital platforms are utilized, Project Naman's aim is not limited to just streamlining pension disbursement; it encompasses a wider range of support services.  The question tests the understanding of the comprehensive nature of the project, distinguishing it from simpler, more limited initiatives.

2.  The NFSA covers all citizens of India irrespective of their income levels or socio-economic status.
3.  The NFSA's implementation is solely managed by the central government, with no state-level involvement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NFSA, 2013, aims to provide subsidized food grains to eligible households at a predetermined price, recognizing the right to food as a statutory right.  The Act defines eligibility criteria based on factors like income, socio-economic status and other factors.  The identification of beneficiaries and the actual distribution of food grains is a complex process involving both central and state governments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NFSA does not cover all citizens.  Specific eligibility criteria are defined to identify beneficiaries who are most vulnerable and in need of food security.  Not all citizens meet these criteria and therefore aren't covered. The Act aims to target the most vulnerable sections of the population.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the central government plays a crucial role in policy formulation and overall program management, the implementation of the NFSA involves significant state-level participation. State governments have responsibilities in identifying beneficiaries, distributing food grains, and managing the logistics of the program.  This collaborative approach is essential for effective implementation across diverse contexts.  The decentralized nature of the program acknowledges the need to adapt distribution mechanisms to specific state-level needs and conditions.

3.  The regulations allow for collaboration between two or more FHEIs to establish a joint campus in India, provided each FHEI meets the eligibility criteria individually.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC Regulations, 2023, actually aim to *facilitate* the entry of higher-ranked foreign universities into India, not prohibit it.  The policy seeks to enhance the quality and internationalization of higher education in the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The regulations specify that FHEIs must be ranked within the global top 500, either overall or in relevant subject areas, or possess outstanding expertise in a particular area.  The top 100 is not the sole criterion.

Statement 3 is correct.  The regulations do permit collaboration between multiple FHEIs to set up campuses in India, provided each participating institution individually meets the stipulated eligibility criteria.  This allows for diverse partnerships and expertise sharing.


**5. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NIRF rankings are solely based on the perception of the institutions by employers and academics.
2. The NIRF framework does not include any parameters related to research and professional practices.
3. The NIRF rankings include separate categories for open universities and skill universities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 uses a broader set of indicators than just economic participation and opportunity. It incorporates four key dimensions: health and survival, educational attainment, economic participation and opportunity, and political empowerment.  A comprehensive assessment of gender parity requires considering these multiple factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report clearly indicates that gender parity has *not* been fully achieved globally. While progress has been made, a significant gender gap still persists across various dimensions and regions. The report highlights the remaining challenges and the time it will take to reach full gender parity.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  India's rank in the 2024 report is lower than its rank in 2023, indicating a decline in its gender parity score.  This highlights the need for continued efforts to address gender inequality in India.

(a) None
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A *lower* GII score indicates lower gender inequality. The index ranges from 0 (complete equality) to 1 (maximum inequality).  A lower score signifies better progress in closing the gender gap.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GII 2022 was released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank.  The UNDP publishes the Human Development Report, which includes the GII.

2.  The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education for the 18-23 age group in India increased to 28.4% in 2021-22, primarily driven by increased female participation.
3.  The National Education Policy (NEP) mandates multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees, allowing students to earn certifications, diplomas, and degrees at different stages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While RPL does aim to integrate informal and non-formal learning, it does so via assessments and certifications, not exclusively through examinations.  The process involves evaluating a learner's existing knowledge and skills gained through various pathways.

Statement 2 is correct. The GER in higher education did indeed rise to 28.4% in 2021-22 from 23.7% in 2014-15. However, it's important to note that while female participation increased significantly, attributing the entire rise to female participation alone would be an oversimplification.

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC regulations of 2023 permit collaboration between two or more FHEIs to establish campuses in India, provided each institution independently meets the eligibility criteria.  This collaborative model encourages the sharing of resources and expertise.

Statement 2 is correct.  The regulations explicitly state that to be eligible, a foreign higher educational institution must be ranked within the top 500 globally, either overall or in specific subject areas.  This criterion ensures a high standard of educational quality in the foreign institutions that establish campuses in India.

Statement 3 is correct. The University of Southampton, UK, received a Letter of Intent (LoI) from the Indian government, becoming the first international university to establish a campus in India under the new UGC regulations. This marks a significant milestone in the internationalization of Indian higher education.

1.  Karnataka is the first state in India to legally permit passive euthanasia for terminally ill patients.
2.  The draft guidelines released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare mandate the establishment of a Secondary Medical Board (SMB) to independently review decisions made by the Primary Medical Board (PMB).
3.  Passive euthanasia involves the active administration of lethal substances to end a patient's life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Kerala was the first state in India to legally allow passive euthanasia, followed by Karnataka.  The statement incorrectly states Karnataka as the first.  Statement 2 is correct. The draft guidelines indeed propose a two-tiered medical board system: a PMB for initial assessment and an SMB for validation. This ensures a thorough and independent review process before life support is withdrawn.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Passive euthanasia, unlike active euthanasia, involves the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, allowing the patient to die naturally.  The act of actively administering a lethal substance is active euthanasia, not passive.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 1 and 3.  Understanding the nuances of passive versus active euthanasia is crucial, as it highlights the ethical and legal complexities surrounding end-of-life care.


**2. With reference to the Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a wide geographical spread, exceeding national health system response capabilities, but specifically exclude diseases with a high *risk* of wide spread.
2.  The amendments establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to primarily support developed nations in pandemic preparedness.
3. The amendments create National IHR Authorities to improve coordination within each country but do not mandate similar international coordination mechanisms.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 incorrectly states that the amendments *exclude* diseases with a high risk of widespread. The amendments explicitly include diseases with a high risk of exceeding national health system response capabilities. Statement 2 is incorrect because the Coordinating Financial Mechanism is designed to assist *developing* countries, not developed ones, in strengthening their pandemic preparedness. Statement 3 is incorrect because the amendments aim to improve both national and *international* coordination through mechanisms like the States Parties Committee and National IHR Authorities. The amendments represent a significant step towards strengthening global health security.  Understanding the specific provisions of these amendments is important for evaluating global preparedness for future health emergencies.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024 ranks India lower than in 2023, indicating a worsening hunger situation.
2.  The report highlights a strong correlation between gender inequality and climate change as the primary drivers of hunger.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While India's ranking improved from 111th in 2023 to 105th in 2024, this still places it in the "serious" category, indicating that the hunger situation is far from resolved. Statement 2 is partially correct in acknowledging the link between gender inequality and hunger but overstates the relationship.  While the report does highlight the impact of gender inequality on hunger, it also points to various other factors, such as climate change, conflict, and economic shocks.  Statement 3 is correct.  The report indicates that despite some improvements in overall GHI score, child wasting and stunting rates remain alarmingly high in India.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate. Option (c) is the correct answer. The GHI report provides valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of hunger and the need for comprehensive interventions.

2. The report directly tracks food waste generation at the production level, providing a comprehensive picture of global food loss.
3. The report supports the goals of SDG 12.3, specifically targeting a reduction in per capita food waste at the retail and consumer levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the report highlights the significant greenhouse gas emissions associated with food waste, it doesn't specifically compare the relative contributions of retail versus household waste in a way that supports the assertion made in this statement.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The report primarily focuses on food waste at the retail and consumer levels (household and food service).  It does not directly track food waste at the production level, which is addressed by other indices like the Food Loss Index (FLI). Statement 3 is correct.  The FWI report directly supports SDG 12.3.1 (b), aiming to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the content of the Food Waste Index Report 2024. Option (c) is the correct answer. The report emphasizes the urgent need to address food waste across the supply chain to improve sustainability and food security.

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Iceland has consistently maintained a top ranking in the GGGI, demonstrating a high level of gender equality. Statement 2 is incorrect. The report projects it will take 134 years to achieve full gender parity at the current rate of progress – far longer than 50 years. Statement 3 is incorrect. India's ranking in the GGGI slightly worsened compared to the previous year's report, indicating that progress on gender equality remains a challenge.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate. Option (a) is the correct answer. The Global Gender Gap Report offers a valuable assessment of gender equality across various dimensions, highlighting areas of progress and persistent challenges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A *lower* GII score actually indicates a *lower* level of gender inequality, signifying greater equality between genders.  Statement 2 is incorrect. India's ranking improved, but the statement uses the word "significantly," which overstates the magnitude of the improvement. Statement 3 is correct. Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland consistently rank highly in the GII, reflecting their strong commitment to gender equality.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. Option (c) is the correct answer. The GII provides a valuable metric for assessing gender inequality across various countries, highlighting areas where progress is needed.

1. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, allow surrogacy using donor gametes only if the intended parents are infertile due to a medical condition certified by the District Medical Board.
2.  The ART Act aims to regulate ART clinics and banks, but it does not address the ethical considerations of surrogacy.
3.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2022, limit the number of surrogacy attempts for a surrogate mother to a maximum of three.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 amendments allow donor gametes under specific medical conditions certified by the District Medical Board.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The ART Act explicitly addresses ethical considerations of ART procedures, including surrogacy. Statement 3 is correct. The 2022 rules indeed limit the number of surrogacy attempts for a surrogate mother to a maximum of three. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate. Option (a) is the correct answer. The ART Act and related regulations represent a significant attempt to regulate and standardize ART procedures in India, ensuring ethical and safe practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act's definition of "aggrieved person" extends beyond women in strictly marital relationships; it encompasses women in various domestic relationships. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act primarily focuses on civil remedies, not criminal ones. While criminal charges might be filed separately, the Act's core mechanism focuses on civil protection orders.  Statement 3 is correct.  The Supreme Court's ruling in the *Hiral P Harsora* case broadened the definition of "person" to include female relatives of the husband, removing the earlier restriction to "adult male."  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. Option (b) is the correct answer. The Act's provisions aim to provide legal protection and redressal to women facing domestic violence, regardless of their specific relationship with the perpetrator.

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2021 amendment allows abortion beyond 24 weeks under broader circumstances than just rape, including cases of substantial fetal abnormalities.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, introduces new provisions related to causing miscarriage but does not entirely replace the MTP Act's provisions.  Both sets of laws coexist and need to be interpreted in conjunction. Statement 3 is correct.  The MTP Act, 1971, does provide for the termination of pregnancies by RMPs up to a specified gestational limit, with specific exceptions beyond that limit. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate. Option (b) is the correct answer. The legal framework surrounding abortion in India is complex and involves multiple overlapping laws.  Understanding the nuances of each law is crucial for a complete understanding of the issue.


**10.  With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JAY is a government-funded health insurance scheme that exclusively covers tribal populations.
2. PM-JAY is included within the Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on health as a percentage of total health expenditure (THE).
3. PM-JAY aims to provide cashless healthcare services at both public and private empaneled hospitals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-JAY is a national health insurance scheme that covers a broader population than just tribal communities; it aims to provide health insurance to a large segment of the Indian population.  Statement 2 is correct.  PM-JAY is indeed included in the SSE on health, as it is a government-funded health insurance program. Statement 3 is correct. PM-JAY provides for cashless healthcare access at both public and private hospitals that are empaneled under the scheme. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate. Option (c) is the correct answer. PM-JAY represents a significant step toward expanding healthcare access in India but faces challenges in implementation and coverage.


**1. With reference to Passive Euthanasia, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India, in the Aruna Shanbaug case (2011), first legally recognized passive euthanasia.
2.  Karnataka is the only state in India that has legally permitted terminally ill patients to die with dignity, following Supreme Court directives.
3. The draft guidelines released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for withdrawing life support in terminally ill patients mandate a single-member Primary Medical Board (PMB) to make the decision.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Aruna Shanbaug case (2011) was a landmark judgment where the Supreme Court of India recognized the legality of passive euthanasia under specific circumstances, paving the way for future legal developments in this area.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Karnataka was among the first states to implement the Supreme Court directives on passive euthanasia, Kerala also allows terminally ill patients to die with dignity, making statement 2 factually inaccurate. Statement 3 is incorrect. The draft guidelines propose a Primary Medical Board (PMB) and a Secondary Medical Board (SMB), both comprising at least three members.  The PMB's decision requires consensus among its members, and the SMB validates this decision.  The single-member board mentioned in statement 3 is not accurate.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.  The other statements contain inaccuracies related to the number of states that have implemented passive euthanasia and the composition of the medical boards involved in the process.


**2. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Food Waste Index (FWI) solely tracks food waste generated at the household level globally.
2.  The FWI aims to reduce per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 75% by 2030.
3. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is the custodian of the FWI, while the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is responsible for the Food Loss Index (FLI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FWI tracks food waste at both retail and consumer levels (household and food service), not solely at the household level. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The FWI aims to *halve* per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030, not reduce it by 75%. This represents a crucial difference and highlights the need for precise understanding of the report's goals. Statement 3 is correct. The UNEP is indeed the custodian of the FWI, while the FAO is responsible for the FLI. This division of responsibility is a key aspect of the international effort to address food loss and waste. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.  The other statements misrepresent the scope of the FWI and its target reduction percentage.


**3. With reference to the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment, consider the following statements:**

1. The NQAS Assessment is exclusively for private healthcare facilities in India.
2. The initiative is implemented in accordance with the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS), a digital platform for real-time monitoring of public health facilities.
3. The Spot Food License Initiative, launched alongside NQAS, aims to complicate the licensing and registration processes for food businesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NQAS Assessment is for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs), which are public health facilities. Statement 2 is correct. The NQAS Assessment is indeed launched in compliance with the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS), a digital platform for real-time monitoring.  This alignment is a crucial aspect of the initiative's design. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Spot Food License Initiative aims to *simplify* the licensing and registration processes, not complicate them. This is a direct contradiction of the statement and highlights the importance of carefully reading the information provided. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. The other two statements contain misinformation regarding the target facilities for assessment and the goal of the Spot Food License Initiative.


**4. With reference to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), consider the following statements:**

1. GAIN's recent report focuses solely on improving nutrition in developed countries.
2.  The report emphasizes nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to reduce gender inequalities and enhance business resilience.
3.  GAIN is a governmental organization under the World Health Organization (WHO).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  GAIN's report addresses nutrition investments across various sectors, with a focus on the agri-food sector to benefit both developed and developing countries, making the statement factually incorrect.  Statement 2 is correct. The report clearly emphasizes the link between nutrition investments in the agri-food sector and improvements in gender equality and business resilience. This is a core theme of GAIN's work. Statement 3 is incorrect. GAIN is an independent, global organization, not a governmental body under the WHO. It partners with various governments and organizations to achieve its goals. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  Statements 1 and 3 contain inaccuracies about GAIN's geographical focus and organizational status.


**5. With reference to the National Medical Register (NMR) Portal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMR Portal is a database that includes all registered medical practitioners in India, regardless of their specialization.
2.  The NMR is mandated under Section 31 of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, and requires linking doctors' Aadhaar IDs to the register.
3. The NMR Portal is managed by the Medical Council of India (MCI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NMR includes a large number of registered medical practitioners, it is specifically for allopathic (MBBS) registered doctors. It does not currently encompass all medical practitioners across various specializations.  Statement 2 is correct. The NMR is indeed mandated under Section 31 of the NMC Act, 2019, and linking doctors' Aadhaar IDs is a key aspect of ensuring authenticity and accurate record-keeping. Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMR Portal is managed by the National Medical Commission (NMC), not the Medical Council of India (MCI). The MCI was replaced by the NMC in 2020. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct. The other statements contain inaccuracies related to the scope of the register and the managing body.


**6. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a high risk of wide geographical spread, exceeding national health system response capabilities.
2. The amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism primarily for developed countries to aid developing nations in pandemic preparedness.
3. The amendments create National IHR Authorities to improve coordination among countries, but do not establish a States Parties Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendments accurately define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with significant geographical spread and the potential to overwhelm national health systems. This is a crucial element of the revised regulations. Statement 2 is incorrect. The amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism to address the needs of *developing* countries, not primarily developed nations. This is a key focus of the revisions, aiming to improve global equity in pandemic response. Statement 3 is incorrect. The amendments do establish both National IHR Authorities and a States Parties Committee to enhance international collaboration and implementation. The statement wrongly claims the absence of the States Parties Committee. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct. The other statements contain inaccuracies about the financial mechanism's target and the existence of the States Parties Committee.


**7.  With reference to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, and its amendments, consider the following statements:**

1. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, reduced the gestation period limit for abortion requiring the opinion of only one Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP).
2.  The 2021 amendment allows abortion beyond 24 weeks only in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, as determined by a state/UT-constituted medical board.
3.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, completely replaces the MTP Act, 1971, and its amendments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2021 amendment *increased*, not reduced, the gestation period limit for abortion requiring the opinion of one RMP.  The change was to extend access within certain parameters. Statement 2 is correct. The 2021 amendment maintains the provision for abortion beyond 24 weeks only under specific circumstances of fetal abnormalities, as determined by a medical board. This reflects the careful balancing of ethical and medical considerations. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, contains provisions related to causing miscarriage but does not entirely replace the MTP Act, 1971, and its amendments.  Both legal frameworks coexist and address related but distinct aspects of reproductive rights and criminal law. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. The other statements contain inaccurate information regarding changes in gestation period limits and the relationship between the MTP Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.


**8. With reference to the Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Act, 2021, and related regulations, consider the following statements:**

1. The ART Act prohibits surrogacy involving donor gametes (egg or sperm) under any circumstances.
2.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, allow surrogacy for single women (widows or divorcees) using only their own eggs and donor sperm.
3.  The National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the implementation of the ART Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced a change, allowing surrogacy with donor gametes under specific medical conditions certified by the District Medical Board. The initial prohibition has been modified. Statement 2 is correct. The amendment rules specifically allow single women (widows or divorcees) to undergo surrogacy using their own eggs and donor sperm. This addresses a specific need within the framework of the ART Act. Statement 3 is correct.  The NARTSB is indeed responsible for overseeing the implementation of the ART Act, including review and monitoring. This is a central function of the board. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct. Statement 1 misrepresents the current regulations regarding donor gametes in surrogacy.


**9. With reference to the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) and its initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. NADA was established in 2005 as a statutory body under the National Anti-Doping Act, 2022.
2.  NADA's key initiatives include the Program for Education and Awareness on Anti-Doping in Sports (PEADS) and the #PlayTrue Campaign.
3.  NADA is solely responsible for the implementation of the World Anti-Doping Code in India, without any international collaboration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NADA was initially set up as a registered society in 2005 and became a statutory body only with the enactment of the National Anti-Doping Act, 2022. The timeline in the statement is inaccurate. Statement 2 is correct. PEADS and the #PlayTrue Campaign are indeed key initiatives of NADA, highlighting its focus on education and awareness. Statement 3 is incorrect. NADA collaborates internationally, for example, through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the South Asia Regional Anti-Doping Organization (SARADO).  The statement falsely presents NADA as entirely isolated in its efforts. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  The other statements contain inaccuracies concerning NADA's establishment and its international collaborations.


**10. With reference to the SPARSH initiative and Project NAMAN, consider the following statements:**

1. Project NAMAN aims to provide services to Defence Pensioners, Veterans, and their families through Common Service Centres (CSCs) managed by Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs).
2.  SPARSH is a digital pension system exclusively for serving military personnel.
3. Each CSC under Project NAMAN is managed by a VLE selected from among veterans or their Next of Kin (NOKs) by the respective Local Military Authorities (LMAs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Project NAMAN leverages CSCs and VLEs to provide dedicated support to Defence Pensioners, Veterans, and their families. This is the core objective of the initiative. Statement 2 is incorrect. SPARSH is a digital pension system designed to streamline pension-related processes for *Defence Pensioners*, not serving military personnel.  The statement wrongly conflates serving personnel with retired pensioners. Statement 3 is correct. The VLEs managing the CSCs under Project NAMAN are indeed selected from veterans or their NOKs by LMAs. This is a key feature of the initiative's implementation strategy. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct. Statement 2 contains an inaccurate description of SPARSH's target beneficiaries.



**1. With reference to India's National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for 2021-22, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP increased to 3.83% from 3.31% in 2017-18, while the per capita THE increased to ₹6,602 from ₹4,297.
2.  Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) decreased to 39.4% of THE, signifying a substantial reduction in household healthcare burdens compared to 2017-18.
3.  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) constituted 48% of the THE, indicating a higher proportion of government funding in healthcare compared to Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NHA estimates for 2021-22 indeed show an increase in both the percentage of GDP allocated to THE and the per capita THE compared to 2017-18.  This reflects a growing investment in healthcare, although the figures themselves might be subject to further analysis considering various economic factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NHA data shows a decrease in OOPE as a percentage of THE, the statement oversimplifies the interpretation.  The actual reduction might not represent a substantial decrease in household healthcare burdens considering factors such as inflation and increased healthcare costs. The statement needs more contextual data to be deemed entirely accurate. Furthermore,  a decrease in OOPE percentage doesn't necessarily equate to a substantial reduction in the absolute amount spent by households.

Statement 3 is correct. The NHA data indicates that GHE constituted a larger percentage of THE compared to private sector contributions. This points towards a significant role of government funding in the Indian healthcare system.  However, this doesn't imply that the private sector's role is insignificant; it simply highlights the government's dominant financial contribution.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The world's GHI score is 18.3, categorized as "moderate" in terms of hunger severity, indicating that the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 remains attainable.
2.  India's GHI score is 27.3, a significant improvement since 2000, suggesting that child wasting and stunting are no longer significant challenges.
3.  The GHI report highlights the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, with women and girls disproportionately affected by food insecurity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the world's GHI score is indeed 18.3 and considered "moderate," the report explicitly states that the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 is unattainable given the alarming hunger levels in numerous countries.  The statement misrepresents the report's conclusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although India's GHI score has improved since 2000,  the report clearly indicates that child wasting and stunting remain very high in India.  The statement selectively presents the data, omitting the crucial information about persistent nutritional challenges.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI report strongly emphasizes the links between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, and it accurately points out that women and girls experience disproportionately higher levels of food insecurity and malnutrition due to the effects of weather extremes and climate emergencies. This highlights crucial social and environmental factors influencing hunger.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by focusing solely on providing direct financial assistance.
2. The scheme draws inspiration from the success of PM-JANMAN and aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence of existing schemes.
3.  PM-JUGA's funding comes entirely from newly allocated funds specifically designated for this scheme, independent of existing resources.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-JUGA's objective is broader than simply providing direct financial aid. It focuses on a holistic approach encompassing improvements in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods, achieved through the convergence of various existing schemes.  The statement oversimplifies the scheme's multifaceted strategy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The scheme explicitly mentions its foundation on the learnings and successes of PM-JANMAN.  It aims to systematically address critical gaps in various sectors through a coordinated effort involving multiple government programs.  This collaborative approach is a key feature of PM-JUGA.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  PM-JUGA leverages existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. The scheme does not rely on entirely new funding but rather on the strategic reallocation and utilization of available resources.  The statement misrepresents the scheme's funding mechanism.


**4. With reference to the Draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The NSP 2024 aims to replace all existing sports schemes and initiatives, creating an entirely new framework for sports development.
2. One of the five pillars of the policy is "Sports for Economic Development," which focuses on using sports to boost related industries such as tourism and manufacturing.
3. The policy aims to completely eliminate doping in sports within the next five years through stringent measures and enhanced testing protocols.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NSP 2024 builds upon previous initiatives like the NSP 2001, Khelo India Scheme, and TOPS.  It's not intended to replace existing schemes entirely but to create a more comprehensive and updated framework.  The statement misinterprets the policy's approach.

Statement 2 is correct.  "Sports for Economic Development" is explicitly identified as one of the five pillars of the NSP 2024.  The policy acknowledges the potential of sports to stimulate economic growth in related sectors, highlighting its broader impact beyond just athletic achievement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The policy doesn't claim to eliminate doping completely within a specific timeframe. While the policy addresses doping as a significant challenge, it focuses on strengthening anti-doping measures, but complete eradication is unlikely to be a stated short-term goal.  The statement presents an unrealistic and overly optimistic claim.


**5. With reference to Passive Euthanasia guidelines released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, consider the following statements:**

1. The guidelines define "terminal illness" comprehensively and provide unambiguous criteria for withdrawing Life Sustaining Treatments (LST) in all cases.
2.  A Secondary Medical Board (SMB) is constituted to independently review and validate the decision of the Primary Medical Board (PMB) regarding LST withdrawal.
3.  The guidelines mandate the involvement of a Clinical Ethics Committee in all cases of passive euthanasia to ensure ethical considerations are prioritized.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the guidelines aim to define "terminal illness," the definition and criteria for LST withdrawal might not be entirely unambiguous in all situations.  Complex medical cases may require nuanced interpretations, leading to potential ambiguities. The statement overstates the clarity and comprehensiveness of the definition.

Statement 2 is correct.  The guidelines indeed establish a two-tiered medical board system, with the SMB acting as a crucial check on the PMB's decision. This ensures a more rigorous and objective review process before LST withdrawal.

Statement 3 is correct.  The involvement of a Clinical Ethics Committee is a key component of the guidelines.  This committee plays a vital role in ensuring ethical considerations are thoroughly examined and potential conflicts are resolved.  The committee's involvement emphasizes a commitment to ethical decision-making in sensitive end-of-life situations.



**1. With reference to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The report defines financing for food security and nutrition to include only public financial resources, excluding private investment.
2.  The report suggests that the world is on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger) by 2030.
3. The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) is primarily responsible for producing the Food Waste Index Report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the report's definition explicitly includes *both* public and private financial resources. Statement 2 is incorrect; the report clearly states the world is far from achieving SDG 2. Statement 3 is incorrect as the Food Waste Index Report is a collaboration between the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP, not the GNAFC.  The GNAFC focuses on addressing the root causes of food crises through improved coordination and response, while the FWI Report tracks food waste at various stages of the supply chain.  Understanding the distinctions between these initiatives and their respective roles in addressing food security is crucial.  The accurate understanding of the report's findings and the roles of different organizations involved in global food security initiatives is essential for a comprehensive analysis.


**2. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The report indicates that food waste contributes to approximately 5-7% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
2. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of the Food Waste Index (FWI).
3. The report's key findings show that households globally wasted less than 500 million meals daily in 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 misrepresents the report's findings; the report estimates that food waste contributes to 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, not 5-7%. Statement 2 is incorrect because the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) is the custodian of the FWI, not the FAO. The FAO is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), which focuses on losses during production and supply chains. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the report indicates that households wasted *over* 1 billion meals a day in 2022, not less than 500 million.  This highlights the scale of the problem and the need for effective interventions to reduce food waste at the household level.  The distinction between FLI and FWI and their respective custodians is a key point to understand.


**3. With reference to the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment and Spot Food License initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The NQAS Assessment is exclusively for private healthcare facilities aiming to achieve accreditation under Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS).
2. The Spot Food License initiative utilizes a pan-India IT platform, Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS), for the immediate issuance of licenses.
3.  The initiatives are entirely funded by international organizations and foreign aid.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect as the NQAS Assessment targets *public* health facilities like Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL), not private ones.  It aims to improve the quality and compliance of these facilities with IPHS standards. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the initiatives utilize technology for efficiency, they are launched and overseen by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, indicating domestic funding and implementation. The Spot Food License initiative's use of FoSCoS for rapid licensing streamlines the process for food businesses.  Understanding the target beneficiaries and funding sources of these initiatives is crucial for evaluating their impact and effectiveness.


**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024 indicates that India's ranking improved significantly, placing it in the "low" category of hunger severity.
2. The report highlights a strong correlation between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger levels.
3. Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe are governmental organizations that collaborated on the GHI report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect as India's ranking improved but it still fell under the "serious" category, not "low".  The report indicates a moderate level of hunger in India. Statement 3 is incorrect; Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe are *non-governmental* organizations (NGOs), not governmental bodies.  The report accurately highlights the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and food insecurity, emphasizing the disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, particularly women and girls.  Knowing the nature of the organizations involved and the accurate interpretation of India's GHI ranking are key aspects.


**5. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The report shows that Iceland, Finland, and Norway are ranked among the bottom three countries in terms of gender parity.
2.  India's ranking improved significantly compared to the previous year's report.
3. The report indicates that at the current rate of progress, it will take more than a century to achieve full gender parity globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect because Iceland, Finland, and Norway are ranked among the *top* three countries, demonstrating high levels of gender parity. Statement 2 is incorrect; India's ranking saw a slight decline, not a significant improvement.  The report's projection that it will take 134 years to reach full gender parity highlights the slow pace of progress and the need for accelerated action to close the gender gap.  The correct interpretation of country rankings and the understanding of the report's overall projections are crucial here.


**6. With reference to the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, consider the following statements:**

1.  A higher GII score indicates lower levels of gender inequality.
2.  India's GII ranking improved significantly compared to 2021.
3. Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland are consistently ranked among the top countries in the GII.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; a *lower* GII score indicates lower levels of gender inequality; a higher score signifies greater inequality.  Statement 2 is incorrect; India's ranking improved, but the improvement wasn't significant.  The consistent high ranking of Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland in the GII reflects their sustained efforts towards gender equality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Spot Food License Initiative explicitly aims to *simplify* the licensing and registration processes, making it easier for food businesses to obtain the necessary permits.  This is a key objective of the initiative.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IPHS is described as a *digital* platform for real-time monitoring of public health facilities. The description in the source material explicitly states its digital nature.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate. The other statements misrepresent the aims and functionalities of the initiatives.


**4. With reference to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) report, consider the following statements:**

1. GAIN's report, "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains," focuses solely on reducing gender inequalities.
2. The report promotes nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to enhance business resilience.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the GAIN report addresses gender inequalities, it also has broader objectives related to productivity and business resilience within the agri-food sector.  The report takes a multi-faceted approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The report explicitly promotes nutrition investments to enhance the resilience of businesses operating within the agri-food sector. This is a central theme of the report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Aruna Shanbaug case (2011) recognized the legality of *passive* euthanasia, not active euthanasia.  Active euthanasia, where a medical professional directly takes action to end a patient's life, remains illegal in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Common Cause case (2018) did indeed uphold the legal validity of passive euthanasia and recognized the right to die with dignity under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 2023 Supreme Court guidelines allow for *more than one* guardian or close relative to be named in a living will.  This reflects a more inclusive approach to accommodating the wishes of individuals regarding end-of-life care.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the legal developments and court rulings surrounding euthanasia in India.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A significant portion of the curriculum emphasizes play-based learning, social-emotional development, and other holistic approaches.  The statement inaccurately portrays the curriculum's scope.

Statement 2 is correct.  Aadharshila explicitly integrates the Panchakosha concept, a holistic framework encompassing physical, pranic (life energy), manasik (emotional/mental), bauddhik (intellectual), and chaitsik (spiritual) development.  This approach reflects a comprehensive view of child development.

Statement 3 is correct. To promote inclusivity, Aadharshila includes age-appropriate screening tools to identify and support children with disabilities. This feature reflects a commitment to ensuring access to quality early childhood care and education for all children, regardless of their abilities.

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The ANRF's formation is legally enshrined in the ANRF Act 2023, and it absorbed the functions and responsibilities of the previous SERB.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ANRF has a target funding of ₹50,000 crore for the period 2023-2028, this is not solely from government sources.  A significant portion (₹36,000 crore) is expected to come from private sources.

Statement 3 correctly describes the composition of the ANRF's Governing Board. The Prime Minister serves as the ex-officio President, with the Union Ministers of Science and Technology and Education holding the ex-officio Vice-President positions.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FRA's definition of 'habitat' is broader than stated.  It encompasses not only customary habitat but also "such other habitats in reserved and protected forests" used by primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.

Statement 2 is correct. Odisha indeed holds the distinction of having the largest number of recognized PVTGs among all Indian states and Union Territories, with thirteen groups officially designated as such.

Statement 3 is also correct. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme, and it operates under a 100% central funding model, providing financial assistance to states and Union Territories.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's judgment in the Sukanya Santha case explicitly struck down caste-based discrimination within prisons as unconstitutional, violating Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23 of the Indian Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The relationship between nomadic tribes and DNTs is not that all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  While many DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, the reverse is not true; there are nomadic communities that are not classified as DNTs.

Statement 3 is correct. The Sukanya Santha case brought to light persistent and systemic caste-based discrimination within prison systems, encompassing aspects such as the segregation of prisoners based on caste and the unequal distribution of labor tasks.


**5. With reference to Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) and the Aadharshila curriculum, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aadharshila is a curriculum designed for children aged 3 to 8 years, focusing on foundational literacy and numeracy skills.

1. RPL is a formal mechanism to assess knowledge and skills gained exclusively through formal education pathways.
2.  The purpose of RPL is to integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal education system through assessments and certifications.
3.  According to the 2021-22 data, India's Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education for the 18-23 age group exceeded 30%.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RPL is explicitly designed to evaluate knowledge, skills, and experience acquired through various learning pathways, including formal, non-formal, and informal learning.  It's not limited to formal education alone.

Statement 2 accurately describes the purpose of RPL. It aims to provide formal recognition for learning obtained outside traditional educational institutions, bridging the gap between informal and formal education systems through appropriate assessments and certifications.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the GER in higher education showed improvement in 2021-22, reaching 28.4% for the 18-23 age group, it did not exceed 30%.


**7. With reference to foreign university campuses in India and the UGC regulations, consider the following statements:**

1. The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, restrict the entry of foreign universities to those ranked within the top 100 globally.

3.  The 17th session of the Conference of States Parties to the UN-CRPD focused on rethinking disability inclusion in the context of the upcoming Summit of the Future.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The UN-CRPD was *adopted* in 2006 and entered into force in 2008.  The number of signatory nations is 164, not 174, and India is among them.  The slight inaccuracies in the numbers make the statement partially incorrect. However, since the question asks which statements are correct, and the core information of adoption, entry into force, and Indian signatory status is accurate, it can be considered correct in the context of the other statements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Biwako Millennium Framework is a separate initiative aiming for an inclusive society for people with disabilities, not specifically children or limited to the Asia-Pacific region, and it's not supplementary to the UN-CRPD.

Statement 3 is correct. The 17th session of the Conference of States Parties did indeed focus on rethinking disability inclusion in the context of the upcoming Summit of the Future.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure within 10 years, focusing primarily on improving sanitation and healthcare access in tribal communities.

3.  PM-JUGA includes interventions related to skill development, entrepreneurship promotion, and enhanced livelihoods for tribal communities, leveraging existing schemes like the Skill India Mission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While PM-JUGA addresses social infrastructure, the timeframe is 5 years, not 10, and it encompasses a broader range of areas beyond just sanitation and healthcare.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The scheme utilizes existing DAPST grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes, not entirely new funding.

Statement 3 is correct.  Skill development, entrepreneurship, and livelihood enhancement are key components of PM-JUGA, and it leverages existing schemes like the Skill India Mission for achieving its goals.


**3. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include a predominantly agricultural-based economy and a high literacy rate, reflecting their advanced socio-economic status.
2. Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs, exceeding 20, followed by Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
3. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme provides 50% central assistance, aiming for comprehensive socio-economic development while preserving their cultural heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural or forest-based livelihoods and extremely low literacy rates, not high literacy.  Their socio-economic status is significantly underdeveloped.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Odisha does have the highest number of recognized PVTGs, the exact number is 13, not exceeding 20.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The scheme provides 100% central assistance, not 50%.

2.  The report highlights the strong correlation between gender inequality, climate change, and heightened levels of hunger globally.
3. India's GHI score has remained stagnant since 2010, with child wasting and stunting rates showing little improvement despite various government initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's rank was 105th, not 106th.

Statement 2 is correct. The GHI 2024 report strongly emphasizes the links between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While the score has fallen since 2000, the statement that it has remained stagnant since 2010 and shows little improvement is an oversimplification.  The trend shows improvement, but child wasting and stunting remain serious concerns.  The slight inaccuracy in the statement makes it partially incorrect.


**6. With reference to the Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments, agreed upon at the 76th World Health Assembly (WHA), redefine a pandemic emergency to include communicable diseases with a high risk of wide geographical spread exceeding national health system response capabilities.
2. A new States Parties Committee is established to oversee the implementation of the IHR, ensuring effective coordination among member states.
3. The amendments include the establishment of a global fund to exclusively support research and development of vaccines for emerging infectious diseases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendments at the 77th WHA (not 76th) redefined pandemic emergencies to include the criteria described.

Statement 2 is correct.  A States Parties Committee was established for improved implementation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the amendments aim to improve preparedness, there is no mention of a global fund exclusively for vaccine R&D.  There is a mention of a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to address the needs of developing countries, but this is not solely for vaccine development.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence of various schemes.
2.  The Abhiyan's funding is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds specifically for this initiative.
3.  PM-JUGA covers approximately 63,000 villages, benefiting over 5 crore tribal people, with a planned tenure of 10 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PM-JUGA focuses on addressing critical gaps in various sectors by leveraging existing schemes and resources.  The core objective is convergence and improved outreach to tribal communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Abhiyan utilizes funding from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. It does not involve the allocation of entirely new funds.

Statement 3 is incorrect regarding the tenure. While the number of villages and beneficiaries is accurate, the planned tenure is 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29), not 10 years.  The incorrect tenure acts as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of the scheme's details.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, indicates that hunger levels in 42 countries are at alarming levels, jeopardizing the "Zero Hunger" goal by 2030.
2.  India's GHI score improved significantly in 2024, placing it in the "low" category of hunger severity.
3.  The report highlights a strong correlation between gender equality, climate change, and improved hunger outcomes globally.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The GHI 2024 report highlights the alarming hunger levels in numerous countries, making the achievement of SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) by 2030 improbable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's ranking improved from 111th in 2023 to 105th in 2024, it remains in the "serious" category of hunger severity, not "low." This deliberate misrepresentation of the ranking serves as a potent distractor.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect.  The report does highlight the link between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger; however, it emphasizes the negative impacts, not improved outcomes. The phrasing "improved hunger outcomes" creates a misleading association.


**3. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NHA estimates are prepared by the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) using the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2001 framework.
2.  In 2021-22, the Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP increased, while the Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) on healthcare as a percentage of THE decreased.
3.  The NHA estimates for India are released annually by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHA estimates utilize the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 framework, not 2001.  The subtle change in the year is designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NHA data for 2021-22 shows an increase in THE as a percentage of GDP and a decrease in OOPE as a percentage of THE.  This represents a positive trend in healthcare financing.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NHA estimates are released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), not MoSPI. The substitution of ministries is a common distractor technique in UPSC-style questions.


**4.  With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Food Waste Index (FWI) tracks food waste generation at the production level globally.
2.  The report indicates that households globally wasted over 1 billion meals daily in 2022, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.
3. UNEP is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FWI focuses on food waste at the retail and consumer levels (household and food service), not at the production level. The scope of the index is deliberately misrepresented to create confusion.

Statement 2 is correct.  The report accurately states that households worldwide wasted over 1 billion meals per day in 2022, contributing substantially to global greenhouse gas emissions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of the FLI, not UNEP. UNEP is the custodian of the FWI. This interchange of organizations is a classic distractor.


**5. With reference to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural level of existence, and a rapidly growing population.
2.  Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and union territories.
3.  The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme provides 50% central assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While forest-based livelihoods and pre-agricultural existence are criteria, the population trend is characterized by stagnation or decline, not rapid growth. This inversion of a key characteristic is a common distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  Odisha indeed has the highest number of recognized PVTGs. This is a straightforward factual recall question.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PVTG development scheme offers 100% central assistance, not 50%.  The incorrect percentage is a powerful distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the scheme's funding mechanism.


**6. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a limited geographical spread and exceeding national health system response capabilities.
2.  The amendments establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to support developing countries in responding to public health emergencies.
3. The amendments abolish the existing World Health Assembly (WHA).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amended IHR defines a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with *wide* geographical spread or a high risk of such spread, exceeding national health system response capabilities. The alteration of "wide" to "limited" is a subtle but significant change designed to mislead.

Statement 2 is correct. The amendments include the establishment of a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to aid developing countries in handling public health crises. This is a key element of the reforms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The WHA remains the decision-making body of the WHO; the amendments do not abolish it.  The inclusion of this obviously false statement serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's basic understanding of global health governance.


**7. With reference to the  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) assessment, consider the following statements:**

1. The NQAS assessment is launched for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) in compliance with Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS).
2. The Spot Food License Initiative aims to streamline the licensing and registration processes for food businesses through a paper-based system.
3. The NQAS assessment utilizes a non-digital platform for real-time monitoring of public health facilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NQAS assessment is indeed launched for AAMs and IPHLs, adhering to IPHS guidelines. This statement tests factual recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Spot Food License Initiative utilizes a pan-India IT platform (FoSCoS) for instant issuance of licenses, not a paper-based system. The description of the system is deliberately altered to create confusion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IPHS is a digital platform enabling real-time monitoring. The description of the platform is changed to a non-digital one to act as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the initiative.


**8. With reference to the  Habitat Rights under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1. Habitat rights are granted only to primitive tribal groups (PVTGs) residing in non-forest areas.
2.  The FRA defines 'habitat' as encompassing customary and other habitats within reserved and protected forests.
3. The process of granting habitat rights involves mandatory consultations with all relevant stakeholders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Habitat rights are granted to PVTGs, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes residing in reserved and protected forests, not exclusively in non-forest areas.  The restriction on the area is a deliberate misdirection.


Statement 2 is correct. The FRA's definition of 'habitat' accurately includes customary and other habitats within reserved and protected forests. This tests factual recall of the legal definition.

Statement 3 is correct.  The process of granting habitat rights necessitates consultations with all relevant stakeholders, ensuring transparency and inclusivity. This highlights the procedural aspect of the rights' allocation.


**9.  With reference to the  Foreign Educational Institutions (Regulation of Entry and Operations) Bill, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bill permits foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) to operate in India without needing prior approval from the University Grants Commission (UGC).
2.  FHEIs operating under this Bill can award degrees under their own name and seal.
3. The Bill prohibits the mobility and credit transfer of students between the main campus of the FHEI and its Indian campus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only



**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Bill requires initial in-principle approval and a Letter of Intent (LoI) from the UGC before FHEIs can operate in India.  The omission of this crucial step is a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. FHEIs are permitted to award degrees under their original institution's name and seal.  This highlights a key aspect of the Bill's provisions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Bill explicitly allows for student mobility and credit transfers between the main campus and the Indian campus, and also between Indian institutions and the FHEI campus. The reversal of this provision is a key distractor.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities, leveraging existing schemes and convergence.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA's core objective is to address critical deficiencies in social infrastructure, healthcare, education, and livelihood opportunities within tribal communities.  The scheme achieves this by strategically utilizing and converging existing government schemes and initiatives, rather than creating entirely new programs. This approach enhances efficiency and resource utilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The funding for PM-JUGA is drawn from *existing* Development Action Plans for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  No new, specific funding is created solely for this Abhiyan.  This emphasizes the scheme's reliance on efficient resource allocation within pre-existing budgetary frameworks.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Abhiyan aims to cover around 63,000 villages, benefiting more than 5 crore tribal people, and is designed to run for a period of five years, from 2024-25 to 2028-29.  This large-scale coverage highlights the government's commitment to comprehensive tribal development.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural subsistence, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy rates, and a subsistence economy.  These groups are primarily located in the states of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra.
2.  The ‘Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)’ Scheme provides 100% Central assistance in the form of grants-in-aid and capital asset creation, focusing on education, housing, agricultural development, and infrastructure strengthening.  The highest number of PVTGs is in Odisha.
3.  Habitat rights for PVTGs, as defined under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), are granted after consultations with stakeholders and encompass customary habitats within reserved and protected forests.  The Bharias tribe in Madhya Pradesh is one such group.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of PVTGs and related government initiatives.  Statement 1 correctly outlines the key criteria used to identify PVTGs and mentions three states with significant PVTG populations, although other states also have substantial numbers. Statement 2 accurately describes the funding mechanism and focus areas of the PVTG development scheme and correctly identifies Odisha as having the highest number of PVTGs. Statement 3 correctly explains the process and scope of habitat rights under the FRA and cites a specific tribal group, the Bharias of Madhya Pradesh, as an example.


**3. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

1.  ANRF was established under the ANRF Act 2023, subsuming the erstwhile Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), with the aim of fostering research and innovation across India.  Its administrative department is the Ministry of Education.
2.  Key initiatives under ANRF include Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR), a mentorship program pairing universities, and Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA), focusing on priority research areas.  ANRF aims to mobilize ₹50,000 crore from both public and private sources.
3.  The ANRF Governing Board is chaired by the Prime Minister, with ex-officio Vice-Presidents including the Union Ministers of Science and Technology and Education.  The Executive Council is chaired by the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India and oversees the establishment of ANRF Centers of Excellence (ACE).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the administrative department of ANRF is the Department of Science and Technology (DST), not the Ministry of Education.  Statements 2 and 3 accurately describe the ANRF's initiatives (PAIR and MAHA), its funding target, the composition of its Governing Board (chaired by the Prime Minister), and the role of its Executive Council in establishing Centers of Excellence.  The accurate identification of the administrative department as the DST is key to differentiating the correct answer from the distractors.


**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, indicates that hunger levels in 42 countries are at alarming levels, making the 2030 Zero Hunger goal unattainable.  India's ranking improved to 105th out of 127 countries, falling under the "serious" category.
2.  India's GHI score of 27.3 shows a decline since 2000, but child wasting (over 18.7%) and stunting (over 35.5%) remain very high among children under five.  The report highlights the link between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, with women and girls disproportionately affected.
3. Initiatives to combat hunger in India include the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, and the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013. The GHI report does not directly address the effectiveness of these programs in reducing hunger.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect information from the GHI 2024 report and related Indian initiatives. Statement 1 correctly reports the global and India-specific findings regarding hunger levels and ranking.  Statement 2 accurately describes India's GHI score and the persistence of child wasting and stunting, along with the report's observations on gender inequality and climate change's impact. Statement 3 correctly lists several key Indian programs aimed at tackling hunger, although the GHI report itself doesn't explicitly assess their effectiveness; that is implied by the statement, making it correct.  The combination of global and India-specific data, along with the mention of specific programs, makes this a complex question.


**1. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, indicates that hunger levels in 42 countries are at alarming levels, making the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 unattainable.  The world's GHI score is 18.3.
2. India's GHI score in 2024 is 27.3, placing it in the "serious" category and ranking 105th out of 127 countries.  More than 30% of children under five in India experience stunting.
3.  The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) aims to provide free food grains to 80 crore poor people, while the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana provides financial assistance and nutritious food to registered women upon the birth of their first child.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The GHI 2024 did indeed highlight alarming hunger levels in numerous countries, jeopardizing the 2030 Zero Hunger goal. While the world's GHI score is approximately 18.3, the precise number might vary slightly depending on the source and methodology.  The core message of the report regarding the severity of the global hunger crisis is accurate.

Statement 2 is also largely correct.  India's ranking and GHI score are accurately reflected, though minor variations are possible due to rounding or data updates. The statement about stunting, however, is slightly off. While child stunting is a significant problem in India, the correct figure is higher than 35.5% according to the provided text. This makes the statement not entirely accurate, though the core message about high levels of stunting is true.

Statement 3 is correct. Both PMGKAY and PMMVY are real government initiatives aiming to address food insecurity and maternal nutrition, respectively.  The description of their objectives provided in the statement is accurate.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are substantially correct, making (b) the appropriate answer.  The slight inaccuracies in the precise figures within statements 1 and 2 do not negate the overall accuracy of their core message.


**2. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHA estimates are prepared by the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) using the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 framework and are released annually by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
2.  In 2021-22, the Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP increased, while the Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) on healthcare as a percentage of THE decreased. Government Health Expenditure (GHE) constituted less than 50% of THE.
3. The SHA 2011, a global standard framework, facilitates cross-country comparisons of health expenditure estimates by classifying them according to consumption, provision, and financing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NHA estimates are indeed prepared by NHATS using the SHA 2011 framework and released by the MoHFW. The statement accurately describes the process and entities involved.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text clearly states that THE as a percentage of GDP increased in 2021-22, and OOPE as a percentage of THE decreased.  The GHE constituted 48% of THE in 2021-22, which is less than 50%.  All the data points within this statement align with the information provided.

Statement 3 is also correct. The description of the SHA 2011 and its purpose accurately reflects its role as a global standard for health accounting and its classification system.

Therefore, all three statements are correct, making (d) the appropriate answer.


**3. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.

**1. With reference to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The IHR, 2005, is a legally binding framework defining countries' rights and obligations in handling only public health events with pandemic potential.
2. The amendments to the IHR, 2005,  include the establishment of a Coordinating Financial Mechanism primarily aimed at developed nations.
3. The 77th World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting concluded without any agreement on amendments to the IHR, 2005, due to disagreements among member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The IHR (2005) is a legally binding framework that addresses public health events and emergencies with the *potential* to cross borders, not solely pandemics.  Statement 1 is incorrect because it limits the scope of IHR to only pandemics. The IHR encompasses a broader range of public health threats.  Statement 2 is incorrect as the Coordinating Financial Mechanism is specifically designed to support developing countries in responding to public health emergencies, not developed nations. The 77th WHA *did* agree on crucial amendments to the IHR (2005), highlighting the need for improved global health preparedness and response mechanisms. Statement 3 is factually incorrect.  Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 is correct.  The amendments aim to strengthen global collaboration and resource allocation for effective public health management.


**2. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The PWDVA, 2005, is enacted under Article 15(2) of the Constitution, focusing solely on providing criminal remedies for domestic violence.
2.  The Act defines domestic violence narrowly, excluding emotional or economic abuse.
3. The Act's applicability extends only to women who are legally married, excluding unmarried partners or widows.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, is enacted under Article 15(3), not Article 15(2), of the Constitution.  Article 15(3) empowers the state to make special provisions for women and children.  The Act provides for both civil and criminal remedies, not solely criminal. Statement 1 is incorrect on both counts. The definition of domestic violence under the PWDVA is broad, encompassing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act covers a wide range of women, including mothers, sisters, wives, widows, and unmarried partners living in a shared household. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The Supreme Court's interpretation has further broadened the scope of the Act to ensure comprehensive protection against domestic violence.


**3. With reference to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, and its amendments, consider the following statements:**

1. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, reduced the gestational limit for abortion for all women to 20 weeks.
2. Under the amended Act, abortions beyond 24 weeks are permitted only in cases of rape, irrespective of foetal abnormalities.
3. The MTP Act, 1971, exclusively grants the authority to perform abortions to registered medical practitioners (RMPs).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, *increased*, not reduced, the gestational limit for abortion.  It allows for abortions up to 24 weeks under certain conditions, including for special categories of women. Statement 1 is factually incorrect.  Abortions beyond 24 weeks are permitted only on grounds of foetal abnormalities, and not solely in cases of rape, requiring the advice of a Medical Board. Statement 2 is incorrect. The MTP Act, 1971, and its amendments exclusively grant the authority to perform abortions to registered medical practitioners (RMPs). Statement 3 is correct.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate. The amendments aimed to provide greater flexibility and access to safe abortion services, but within a defined legal framework.


**4. With reference to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2001 Census ranked Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Odisha as the top three states with the highest PVTG populations.
2.  Habitat rights for PVTGs are granted under Section 3(1)(f) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA).
3.  All nomadic tribes are classified as PVTGs, but not all PVTGs are nomadic tribes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 2001 Census ranked Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Jharkhand as the top three states with the highest PVTG populations, not Odisha.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. Habitat rights for PVTGs are granted under Section 3(1)(e), not Section 3(1)(f), of the Forest Rights Act, 2006. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Not all nomadic tribes are classified as PVTGs; PVTGs represent a specific subset of tribal communities facing extreme vulnerability.  While some PVTGs may be nomadic, the classification is not synonymous.  Statement 3 is also incorrect.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.  The FRA aims to secure the land and habitat rights of vulnerable tribal communities, and PVTGs represent a particularly marginalized group within this population.


**5. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The definition of a pandemic emergency now includes communicable diseases with a high risk of "narrow geographical spread."
2.  The amendments establish a States Parties Committee to oversee the implementation of the IHR, but do not create national IHR authorities.
3. The amendments focus solely on strengthening response mechanisms and do not address public health surveillance or preparedness.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The definition of a pandemic emergency in the amended IHR includes communicable diseases with a "wide," not "narrow," geographical spread or a high risk thereof. Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments *do* establish both a States Parties Committee and encourage the creation of National IHR Authorities to improve coordination at both international and national levels. Statement 2 is incorrect. The amendments address all three aspects: public health surveillance, response, and preparedness mechanisms, acknowledging their interconnectedness for effective pandemic prevention and management. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, none of the statements are accurate.  The amendments represent a significant step towards strengthening global health security and improving the world's ability to prevent, detect, and respond to public health emergencies.


**1. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines "person with disability" as someone with a long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairment that hinders full and effective societal participation.  This definition includes acid attack victims.
2.  The Act mandates a 6% reservation for Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBDs) in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
3. The Act stipulates that the government must formulate programs to ensure PwDs have an adequate standard of living, enabling independent or community living.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RPwD Act, 2016, provides a broad definition of "person with disability," encompassing various impairments and explicitly including acid attack victims as persons with disabilities.  This inclusive definition aims to ensure that all individuals facing such challenges are covered under the Act's protective provisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a 5% reservation for PwBDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions, not 6%.  This reservation is a crucial aspect of the Act, aimed at promoting inclusive education and equal opportunities for PwDs.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act explicitly charges the government with the responsibility of creating and implementing social security programs designed to provide PwDs with a sufficient standard of living. This aspect of the Act emphasizes the government's role in ensuring that PwDs are not marginalized but have the support they need to live full and productive lives.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, and education in tribal villages, primarily focusing on the convergence of existing schemes.
2. The scheme's funding is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds specifically for this initiative.
3. PM-JUGA's name is inspired by Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known for leading the 'Ulgulan' movement against British rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA's core objective is to address critical shortcomings in essential services within tribal communities.  It achieves this by leveraging and coordinating existing governmental schemes, rather than relying on entirely new funding streams.  This approach emphasizes efficiency and resource optimization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PM-JUGA's funding is drawn from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. It does not involve the creation of a new, separate funding source. This demonstrates a commitment to utilizing existing resources effectively.

Statement 3 is correct. The scheme's name, "Dharti Aaba," is a reference to Birsa Munda, a significant figure in tribal history known for his resistance against British colonial rule. This naming choice underscores the scheme's intention to empower and uplift tribal communities, acknowledging their historical struggles and aspirations.


**3.  With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread exceeding national health system response capabilities.
2. The amendments establish a new, independent global health agency to replace the World Health Organization (WHO).
3. The amendments mandate the creation of National IHR Authorities in all member states to improve domestic coordination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendments to the IHR, 2005, provide a clear definition of a pandemic emergency, emphasizing the scale of geographical spread and the strain on national health systems. This precise definition aims to facilitate a more effective and timely global response to future public health crises.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The amendments do not propose replacing the WHO. Instead, they strengthen the existing framework within the WHO to improve its effectiveness in coordinating international responses to health emergencies. The focus is on enhancing existing structures, not replacing them.

Statement 3 is correct.  The amendments call for the establishment of National IHR Authorities within each member state. This is a crucial step in improving national-level preparedness and coordination in handling public health emergencies, ensuring a more effective response to outbreaks.

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aadharshila, meaning "foundation stone," is a comprehensive curriculum spanning 48 weeks, specifically targeted at children aged 3 to 6 years. Its primary implementation setting is the Anganwadi centers, which play a crucial role in early childhood development in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The curriculum incorporates a play-based calendar, including a dedicated four-week introductory phase designed to ease the transition of children from their homes to the Anganwadi environment. This approach prioritizes a child-centered and playful learning experience.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), not the Ministry of Education, launched Aadharshila. While the curriculum aligns with the overall goals of the National Education Policy 2020, it falls under the MoWCD's purview due to its focus on early childhood care and development.


**5. With reference to the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in higher education, consider the following statements:**

1. RPL is a formal process to assess knowledge, skills, and experience gained through formal, non-formal, or informal learning pathways and provide academic credit.
2. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued final guidelines for the implementation of RPL across all Indian universities.
3. RPL aims to enhance access to higher education by recognizing learning acquired outside traditional educational settings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. RPL is indeed a formal mechanism designed to evaluate the knowledge, skills, and experience individuals acquire through various learning pathways, including formal education, non-formal training, and informal learning experiences.  This assessment allows for the granting of academic credit for this prior learning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UGC issued *draft* guidelines, not final guidelines, for RPL.  The process of finalizing and implementing these guidelines is still ongoing, involving consultations and revisions.  Therefore, claiming that final guidelines are already in place would be inaccurate.

Statement 3 is correct. A central goal of RPL is to make higher education more accessible to individuals who have gained skills and knowledge outside the traditional formal education system. This approach recognizes the value of diverse learning experiences and aims to bridge potential gaps in access to higher education.


**6. With reference to the Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following statements:**

3. August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNTs to commemorate their struggle against societal discrimination.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The relationship between nomadic tribes and DNTs is not that all nomadic tribes are DNTs. While many DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, not all nomadic groups were ever designated as "criminal tribes" under the Criminal Tribes Act. The categorization was based on specific criteria, not simply on nomadic lifestyle.

Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a discriminatory law that labeled certain communities as inherently criminal, was repealed in 1949. This repeal marked a significant step towards rectifying historical injustices and addressing the social stigma associated with the categorization.

Statement 3 is correct. August 31st is indeed observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNTs. This day serves as a reminder of the historical injustices faced by these communities and their ongoing struggle for social justice and equality.  It's a day for commemoration and advocacy.

Statement 1 is correct. India is indeed a signatory to the UN-CRPD, and the convention officially came into force in 2008. This signifies India's commitment to upholding the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities at the international level.

Statement 2 is correct. The UN-CRPD's primary goal is to guarantee that persons with disabilities can fully and equally exercise all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The convention underscores the importance of respecting their inherent dignity and promoting their inclusion in society.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD's definition of "persons with disabilities" is much broader than just those with long-term physical impairments. It encompasses individuals with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments that, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.  The definition is inclusive of a wide range of disabilities.


**8. With reference to the  "Habitat Rights" under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1. Habitat rights are granted to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) under Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA.
2.  Habitat rights primarily focus on providing PVTGs with alternative housing outside forest areas.
3. The FRA guarantees habitat rights to all tribal communities residing in forest areas irrespective of their vulnerability status.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Habitat rights are specifically provided to PVTGs under Section 3(1)(e) of the Forest Rights Act, 2006. This provision recognizes the unique needs and vulnerabilities of these groups and aims to secure their traditional dwelling places within forest areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Habitat rights under the FRA are not about providing alternative housing outside forest areas.  Instead, they are about securing the right of PVTGs to continue residing in their traditional habitats within the forest, acknowledging their historical and cultural connection to these lands.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FRA does not guarantee habitat rights to *all* tribal communities.  While it aims to secure forest rights for many tribal groups, habitat rights under Section 3(1)(e) are specifically targeted toward PVTGs, recognizing their distinct vulnerability and dependence on forest resources.


**1. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NIRF rankings include parameters such as Teaching, Learning and Resources, Research and Professional Practices, Graduation Outcomes, Outreach and Inclusivity, and Perception, but excludes Innovation.
2. The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) is the sole implementing agency for NIRF, without any collaboration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NIRF framework explicitly includes "Innovation" as a ranking parameter, integrating it into the India Rankings.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the NBA collaborates with the INFLIBNET Centre in Gandhinagar for NIRF implementation.  Statement 3 is partially correct. While new categories were indeed added in 2024 and IIT Madras did top the Overall category, it was for the sixth, not seventh, consecutive time. However, given the other two statements are incorrect, and the minor discrepancy in the number of consecutive wins is not a major factual error, option (c) remains the most appropriate choice.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in seemingly correct statements.  Understanding the key players involved in NIRF (NBA and INFLIBNET) and the evolution of its ranking parameters are crucial for UPSC aspirants.

3. The amendments mandate the creation of National IHR Authorities in all WHO member states to enhance international coordination.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 incorrectly simplifies the definition of a pandemic emergency; the amendments include both "wide geographical spread" and the exceeding of national health system capacity as criteria. Statement 2 misrepresents the financial mechanism; it is intended to address the needs of *developing* countries, not exclusively for high-income countries. Statement 3 is incorrect because while the amendments encourage the creation of National IHR Authorities, they don't mandate it for *all* WHO member states. This question assesses factual recall regarding the IHR amendments, demanding precise understanding of the key changes.  Understanding global health governance and the role of the WHO is crucial for UPSC preparation.  The options include plausible distractors, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between nuanced details.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 is incorrect because while ANRF did subsume SERB and was established under the ANRF Act 2023, its funding is not solely from the central government; it involves significant private sector contributions.  Statement 2 is incorrect; MAHA's scope extends beyond renewable energy to include diverse areas like advanced materials, health technology, etc. Statement 3 is incorrect; the ANRF Governing Board is chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Union Minister of Science and Technology.

3.  The UGC grants final approval for the establishment of foreign university campuses in India only after the campus is physically established.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The regulations specify that FHEIs ranked within the global top 500, either overall or in relevant subject areas, are eligible. Statement 2 is correct; collaboration is permitted, but each participating FHEI needs to meet the criteria individually. Statement 3 is incorrect; the UGC provides initial in-principle approval and a Letter of Intent (LoI), with the expectation that campuses will be set up within two years, not after physical establishment.  The question assesses understanding of the UGC regulations governing foreign university campuses in India.  The nuances of the eligibility criteria and the approval process are crucial aspects for UPSC aspirants.  The distractors are designed to test comprehension of the regulatory framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHA estimates are released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), not the Ministry of Finance, and are not released annually but rather for specified fiscal years.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the NHA explicitly covers the financial flows within India's health system, including how funds are collected, spent, and how healthcare services are utilized.  Statement 3 is correct; it accurately reflects the methodology and guidelines used in preparing the NHA estimates. This question focuses on the technical aspects of NHA and tests the candidate's ability to recall key details about its preparation and content.  Understanding the Indian healthcare system's financial aspects is important for UPSC. The distractors are designed to be believable, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the NHA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the POSH Act mandates ICCs only in organizations with 10 or more employees. Statement 2 is incorrect; while an external member is recommended, it is not mandatory.  Statement 3 is correct; the ICC is explicitly granted the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, during its inquiries.  This question tests knowledge of the POSH Act's provisions and assesses the ability to differentiate between mandatory and recommended components.  Understanding the legal framework for protecting women's rights in the workplace is crucial for UPSC.  The options are carefully chosen to create doubt and test precise understanding.

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false; the PWDVA covers women in various domestic relationships, including unmarried partners. Statement 2 is false; the Act includes physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. Statement 3 is false; children in shared households are entitled to relief under the Act.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the scope and provisions of the PWDVA.  Knowledge of this legislation and its application is vital for UPSC. The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's understanding of the Act's comprehensive nature.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report explicitly addresses all four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability.  The four dimensions of food security are fundamental to the report's analysis.  Focusing solely on availability would be a gross misrepresentation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report highlights that the world is far from achieving SDG 2, Zero Hunger, by 2030.  The report's assessment of progress towards SDG 2 is a key finding, emphasizing the significant challenges remaining.  Claiming the world is on track would be misleading.

Statement 3 is correct. The report introduces a comprehensive definition of financing for food security and nutrition, including various sources of funding.  The definition of financing is a key contribution of the report, providing a framework for understanding investments in food security.  This clarifies the scope of funding considered.

The definition of a pandemic emergency is a crucial element of the IHR, guiding countries' responses.  A precise definition is essential for effective international cooperation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The established financial mechanism aims to support *developing* countries, not developed countries.  The focus on developing countries is a key element of the amendments, recognizing their greater vulnerability in pandemic situations.  Reversing the support focus would misrepresent the amendments' priorities.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The amendments *do* establish a States Parties Committee to improve implementation.  The existence of the States Parties Committee is a crucial aspect of the strengthened international cooperation mechanisms introduced by the amendments.  Omitting this committee misrepresents the structure of the revised IHR.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Adharshila incorporates the Panchakosha concept, it focuses on *all five* aspects of development: physical, life energy, emotional/mental, intellectual, and spiritual.  The inclusion of all five aspects of the Panchakosha concept is a key feature.  Limiting it to only two would be a misrepresentation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The curriculum uses play-based learning to foster emergent mathematical and literacy skills.  The use of play-based learning is a key pedagogical approach.  The emphasis on play highlights a child-centered approach to learning.

3. The GHI report highlights the absence of any correlation between gender inequality and hunger.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 report explicitly states that the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 is *unattainable* based on current trends.  This highlights the severity of the global hunger crisis and the need for more significant interventions.

Statement 2 is correct. India's ranking and score did improve in the GHI 2024 report compared to the previous year, however, the report also emphasizes that despite this improvement, the levels of child wasting and stunting are still alarmingly high. This demonstrates the persistent challenges in addressing malnutrition in India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI report clearly establishes a link between gender inequality and hunger, indicating that women and girls are disproportionately affected by food insecurity and malnutrition.  This underscores the importance of addressing gender inequality as a crucial element of hunger eradication strategies.

**1. With reference to the QS World University Rankings, 2025, consider the following statements:**

1. The rankings are released by Times Higher Education (THE).
2.  Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) secured a rank below 200.
3. The rankings are based on fewer than 8 performance indicators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The QS World University Rankings, 2025, are released by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), not Times Higher Education (THE).  THE publishes its own World University Rankings. This is a common point of confusion for aspirants, as both QS and THE are prominent ranking organizations.  The difference in methodologies and resulting rankings highlight the complexities of evaluating higher education institutions globally.

Statement 2 is correct. IIT-B is indeed the top-ranked Indian institution in the QS rankings, but its precise rank is 118, which falls below the 200 mark.  The question plays on the tendency to remember only the top-ranked institution without recalling the exact numerical rank.  This emphasizes the importance of precise recall in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The QS World University Rankings utilize nine performance indicators, not fewer than eight.  The difference of one indicator is a deliberate distractor, testing the candidate's attention to detail. The nine indicators cover a range of aspects of university performance, including academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty-student ratio, citations per faculty, and international faculty ratio.


**2. With reference to the University Grants Commission (UGC) Regulations, 2023, consider the following statements:**

3.  The regulations permit only one FHEI to establish a campus in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, explicitly aim to *facilitate* the entry of top-ranked foreign universities into India, as envisioned by the National Education Policy 2020. This is a key policy shift aimed at internationalizing Indian higher education. The statement reverses the actual intent of the regulations.

Statement 2 is correct. The regulations stipulate that FHEIs must be ranked within the global top 500 (either overall or in relevant subject areas) or possess exceptional expertise in a specific field to be eligible.  This criterion is designed to ensure a high standard of education from foreign institutions operating in India.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The regulations explicitly allow for collaboration between two or more FHEIs to establish campuses in India, provided each institution individually meets the eligibility criteria.  This provision promotes collaboration and resource sharing, potentially leading to more diverse educational offerings.


**3. With reference to the Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency to exclude communicable diseases with limited geographical spread.
2. The amendments establish a new financial mechanism solely for developed nations to address pandemic preparedness.
3. The amendments create National IHR Authorities to improve international coordination.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments to the IHR, 2005, actually define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with *wide* geographical spread or a high risk of such spread, exceeding or potentially exceeding the capacity of national health systems.  The statement incorrectly suggests the opposite.  This highlights the importance of understanding the precise wording of international health regulations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism to address the needs of *developing* countries, not solely developed nations.  This reflects a focus on equitable access to resources and pandemic preparedness in countries with limited capacity. The reversal of the target beneficiary group is a deliberate attempt to mislead.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the amendments do indeed aim to improve coordination, they create National IHR Authorities to enhance *national*, not *international*, coordination within individual countries. This is crucial for effective response to public health emergencies.  The subtle difference between national and international coordination is a key distractor.


**4. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

1. ANRF's funding is entirely sourced from the central government.
2.  The Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA) focuses solely on research in humanities.
3.  The ANRF subsumed the erstwhile Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ANRF's funding model involves a significant contribution from private sources (₹36,000 crore) in addition to central government funding (₹14,000 crore). This public-private partnership model is intended to leverage both public resources and private sector investment in research and development. The statement falsely portrays ANRF as solely reliant on government funding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. MAHA's focus is on priority-driven, solution-focused research across various high-impact areas, *including* but not limited to EV mobility, advanced materials, solar cells, and health and medical technology. The statement falsely limits MAHA's scope to only humanities research.

Statement 3 is correct. The ANRF Act, 2023, established ANRF, and the existing SERB was indeed subsumed under ANRF. This consolidation aimed to streamline research funding and coordination in India.  This is a straightforward factual recall question.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006, not 2007. This is a simple factual recall question testing the candidate's knowledge of the convention's adoption date.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India is a signatory to the UN-CRPD. The statement incorrectly states the opposite, acting as a strong distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The convention's objective is to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, encompassing a much broader scope than just economic empowerment. This tests the candidate's understanding of the convention's comprehensive goals.  The statement narrowly defines the convention's aims, acting as a misleading distractor.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Supreme Court in the Common Cause case did affirm the right to die with dignity under Article 21 and upheld the legality of passive euthanasia. However, it's crucial to note that the ruling didn't establish a blanket legalization but rather provided a framework and guidelines for its implementation.  The court emphasized stringent procedural safeguards to prevent abuse.

Statement 2 is accurate. The draft guidelines indeed mandate the formation of PMB and SMB for a multi-layered review process to ensure checks and balances in end-of-life decisions.  The consensus-based approach is key to minimizing potential errors and ethical conflicts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Karnataka and Kerala are prominent examples of states that have made provisions for the right to die with dignity,  it's inaccurate to say they are the *only* two. Other states might have adopted similar measures or interpretations of the Supreme Court's guidelines, even if not explicitly codified into law. The situation is evolving and varies across states.


**2. With reference to the Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

The regulations stipulate that FHEIs must be ranked in the global top 500 (either overall or in relevant subject areas) or possess outstanding expertise in a particular area to be eligible.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the UGC initially grants in-principle approval and issues a Letter of Intent (LoI).  The FHEIs are expected to set up campuses within two years of receiving the LoI. The regulations represent a significant policy shift, aiming to enhance the quality and internationalization of higher education in India. However, the stringent eligibility criteria and the two-year timeframe for campus establishment indicate a cautious and phased approach to the integration of foreign universities into the Indian higher education landscape.

2. All nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs, reflecting the historical overlap between these groups and their unique vulnerabilities.
3. DNTs, historically designated as "born criminals" under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, are a homogeneous group primarily engaged in traditional occupations such as hunting and gathering.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly summarizes a key aspect of the Supreme Court's decision in *Sukanya Santha v. UoI & Others*. The court's ruling directly addressed the issue of caste-based discrimination within prisons, impacting DNTs and others.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs. The relationship is not a complete overlap; while many DNTs are nomadic, the categories are distinct.

Statement 3 is also incorrect. DNTs are a heterogeneous group engaged in various occupations, not solely limited to hunting and gathering. The description of DNTs as a homogeneous group engaged in a limited range of traditional occupations is a significant oversimplification and inaccuracy.  The Criminal Tribes Act's categorization of DNTs as "born criminals" is also a historical injustice, not a reflection of their actual occupations.


**5. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The report's theme focuses on the private financial resources directed towards eradicating hunger and malnutrition, prioritizing access and utilization of nutritious foods.
2. The report indicates that the world is on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, Zero Hunger, with a significant reduction in global hunger levels.
3. The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) was launched in 2015 by the European Union, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Food Programme (WFP).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The report does focus on financing to end hunger and malnutrition, encompassing both public and private, domestic and foreign resources.  It emphasizes the availability, access, utilization, and stability of nutritious and safe foods, and the resilience of agrifood systems. However, the statement simplifies the report's focus by solely mentioning private resources and prioritizing access and utilization over other crucial aspects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report explicitly states that the world is far off track to achieve SDG 2, Zero Hunger, highlighting that 1 in 11 people faced hunger globally in 2023. This directly contradicts the statement's claim of the world being on track and showing significant reduction.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GNAFC was launched in 2016, not 2015, at the World Humanitarian Summit.  The founding organizations are correctly identified. The year is a crucial detail, demonstrating a lack of precise factual recall.

Therefore, only statement 1 contains a partially accurate element, making (a) the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 2 and 3.

1. The GRFC is produced biennially by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN).
2. The GRFC aims to improve humanitarian responses and reduce the number of people facing acute food insecurity by better linking existing initiatives related to food crises.
3. The GRFC is a joint initiative of the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and several NGOs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GRFC is produced annually, not biennially, by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). The frequency of the report is a key detail often missed.

Statement 2 is correct.  The GRFC, launched by the GNAFC, explicitly aims to improve humanitarian responses and reduce acute food insecurity by better linking existing initiatives, partnerships, programs, and policy processes.  The statement accurately reflects the report's core objective.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GRFC is a joint initiative of the European Union, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Food Programme (WFP). The WHO and IMF are not involved in this particular report.  This statement includes incorrect organizations, showcasing a misunderstanding of the report's governance.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. The other options are incorrect because of the factual errors in statements 1 and 3.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FWI specifically tracks global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer (household and food service) levels.  It does *not* focus on the production level, making this a significant factual inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The FWI directly supports both SDG 12.3.1 (a) and 12.3.1 (b), targeting food loss reduction in supply chains and halving per capita food waste at the retail and consumer level.  This accurately reflects the report's alignment with the SDGs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 was launched by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme), not by the WFP and FAO.  This highlights a key error in attributing the report's authorship.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the factual errors in statements 1 and 3.

1. GAIN is a US-based non-governmental organization focused on tackling malnutrition by promoting public-private partnerships.
2. GAIN supports investments in nutritious foods value chains to reduce gender inequalities and enhance business resilience.
3. GAIN released a report titled 'The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains: An Opportunity for Gender Equality and Economic Growth'

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GAIN is a Swiss-based, not US-based, NGO. The location is a crucial detail, indicating a lack of precise knowledge about the organization.  While it does tackle malnutrition and promotes public-private partnerships, the location is fundamentally wrong.

Statement 2 is correct. GAIN actively supports investments in nutritious foods value chains to address gender inequalities and strengthen business resilience. This accurately reflects GAIN's strategic approach.

Statement 3 is partially correct. GAIN *did* release a report on investment in nutritious foods value chains and its impact on gender, but the title is slightly different. The precise wording of the title is a detail that could be a distractor, but the core message remains accurate.

Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are essentially correct, making (d) the appropriate answer. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1 and the slight imprecision in statement 3’s title.

3. The Spot Food License Initiative aims to complicate the licensing and registration processes for food businesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  While the NQAS assessment was launched for Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL), it was launched for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM), not AB-HWCs.  The subtle difference in terminology is a potential distractor, but the core information regarding IPHLs is correct.

Statement 2 is correct. The NQAS assessment is indeed based on the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS), a digital platform for real-time monitoring, accurately reflecting the assessment's framework.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Spot Food License Initiative aims to *simplify*, not complicate, the licensing and registration processes through the FoSCoS platform. This demonstrates a direct reversal of the initiative's actual goal.

Therefore, only statements 1 (partially) and 2 are correct, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies or partial correctness in statement 1 and the completely incorrect statement 3.


**6. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024 was released by the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
2. The GHI 2024 ranks India in the "serious" category of hunger severity, with a score indicating that a significant percentage of the population suffers from undernourishment.
3. The GHI 2024 findings highlight a strong correlation between gender equality and climate change, but not hunger.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 was released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the WFP and UNICEF. This highlights a common mistake in attributing the report's authorship.

Statement 2 is correct. The GHI 2024 does rank India in the "serious" category, indicating high levels of undernourishment. The statement accurately reflects the report's findings regarding India's hunger situation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 explicitly highlights the link between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, demonstrating a multi-faceted analysis of hunger's root causes, contradicting the statement.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. The incorrect attribution in statement 1 and the contradictory information in statement 3 make the other options unsuitable.


**7. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 was released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
2. The report indicates that Iceland, Finland, and Norway are among the top three countries with the smallest gender gaps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 was released by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the UNDP.  This is a crucial factual error in identifying the report's publisher.

Statement 2 is correct.  The report does indeed show Iceland, Finland, and Norway among the top three countries with the smallest gender gaps.  This accurately reflects the report's key findings.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India's ranking in the 2024 report *declined* slightly compared to the 2023 report, showing a worsening of gender parity. This directly contradicts the statement's claim of significant improvement.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the factual errors in statements 1 and 3.


**8. With reference to the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, consider the following statements:**

1. The GII 2022 was released by the World Economic Forum (WEF) as part of its Human Development Report.
2. A lower GII score indicates a higher level of gender inequality.
3. In the GII 2022, India's ranking improved compared to the previous year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GII 2022 was released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the WEF.  The publishing organization is a key fact often confused.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A *lower* GII score indicates a *lower* level of gender inequality; a higher score shows greater inequality. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the index's scoring system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India's ranking in the GII 2022 showed a slight *improvement* compared to the previous year, but not a significant improvement.  The direction of the change is correctly identified, but the degree of change is inaccurate.

Therefore, all three statements are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer.  The inaccuracies in all three statements demonstrate a lack of understanding of the GII report and its data.

1. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by focusing solely on educational infrastructure development.
2. PM-JUGA is funded entirely from newly allocated funds specifically designated for this scheme.
3. PM-JUGA promotes tribal home stays to tap into the tourist potential of tribal areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-JUGA aims to improve socio-economic conditions through a holistic approach encompassing social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood improvements, not just education.  This represents a misunderstanding of the scheme's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  PM-JUGA is funded from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, not entirely from newly allocated funds.  The source of funding is a crucial detail often overlooked.

Statement 3 is correct. PM-JUGA does indeed promote tribal home stays as a way to leverage tourism potential. This accurately reflects one component of the scheme.

Therefore, only statement 3 is correct, making (b) the correct option. The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 1 and 2.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendments do define a pandemic emergency based on wide geographical spread and exceeding national health systems' response capacities, accurately reflecting a key change in the IHR.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Coordinating Financial Mechanism aims to address the needs of *developing* countries, not developed countries, highlighting a crucial misunderstanding of the amendment's focus.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 77th WHA meeting *agreed* on the amendments, not rejected them. This shows a complete reversal of the actual outcome of the meeting.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct answer.  The factual inaccuracies in statements 2 and 3 make the other options incorrect.


**1. With reference to the Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy aims to integrate sports with education, aligning with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024 is indeed designed to harmonize with the NEP 2020, integrating sports into the educational framework. This reflects a broader understanding of the holistic development of individuals through sports.  The policy also explicitly aims to establish a National Fitness Ranking & Indexing system, promoting a nationwide sports culture and encouraging participation beyond elite levels.  Furthermore, the NSP 2024 recognizes the economic potential of sports, intending to leverage its influence to boost related sectors like tourism and manufacturing, thus contributing to national economic development.  All three statements accurately reflect key features of the policy.

1.  The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, adopted in 2005, is a legally binding framework that only addresses the use of banned substances.
2. India's National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) was established in 2005 as a statutory body under the National Anti-Doping Act, 2022.
3.  Blood transfusions are considered a form of doping as they artificially enhance oxygen levels in the bloodstream, providing an unfair competitive advantage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. Blood transfusions are indeed a form of doping, as they artificially increase oxygen-carrying capacity, providing an unfair advantage in sports. Statement 1 is incorrect because the UNESCO Convention covers a broader scope than just banned substances; it addresses the prevention and fight against doping in general, encompassing various methods and approaches. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While NADA was established in 2005, it was initially a registered society, not a statutory body. The National Anti-Doping Act, 2022, later formalized its status.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the facts.


**3. With reference to multilingualism initiatives in education, consider the following statements:**

1. The Asmita Project aims to produce 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages over a period of 10 years.
2.  Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is a multilingual dictionary repository launched as part of the initiative to promote multilingualism in education.

(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is indeed a multilingual dictionary repository, and the Real-time Translation Architecture uses technology to enhance translation.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. The Asmita Project aims to produce 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages, but the timeframe is 5 years, not 10 years.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**4. With reference to Project NAMAN, consider the following statements:**

1. Project NAMAN is an initiative by the Indian Navy to provide support services to retired personnel and their families.
2.  The project utilizes SPARSH (System for Pension Administration Raksha) to streamline the delivery of services to defence pensioners and veterans.
3.  Project NAMAN aims to establish Common Service Centres (CSCs) exclusively in urban areas to ensure easy access for beneficiaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Project NAMAN is an Indian Army initiative, not Navy, that leverages the SPARSH system to improve service delivery to pensioners and veterans.  Statement 1 is incorrect because of the branch of the armed forces. Statement 3 is incorrect as the CSCs are planned across India, encompassing both rural and urban areas, not exclusively urban.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The report does indeed rank Iceland, Finland, and Norway highly, and it projects it will take 134 years, not 132 years to achieve full gender parity. Statement 3 is incorrect. India's ranking shows a slight decline (129th in 2024 vs 127th in 2023), not an improvement.  Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.

1. The GII score ranges from 0 (complete equality) to 1 (maximum inequality), with lower scores indicating lower gender inequality.
2.  Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland consistently rank among the top three countries with the lowest GII scores.
3.  India's 2022 GII ranking improved significantly compared to its 2021 ranking, indicating substantial progress in reducing gender inequality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The GII scoring system accurately reflects the described scale, and Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland consistently rank highly.  Statement 3 is incorrect. India's 2022 ranking (108th) shows an improvement over 2021 (122nd), but the improvement is not described as "significant" in the provided text. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**7. With reference to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), consider the following statements:**

1. WADA's headquarters are located in Lausanne, Switzerland.
2. WADA was established in 1999 following the Lausanne Declaration on Doping in Sport.
3. WADA's ADAMS system is a technology platform used to coordinate and simplify anti-doping activities worldwide.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. WADA was indeed established in 1999 following the Lausanne Declaration, and it uses the ADAMS system for anti-doping coordination. However, statement 1 is incorrect. WADA's headquarters are located in Montreal, Canada, not Lausanne, Switzerland.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana does provide financial and nutritional support, and Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on supplementary nutrition to combat child malnutrition. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The NFSA, 2013, provides subsidized food grains but not to all citizens; it covers a specific, prioritized section of the population based on socioeconomic criteria.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are completely accurate.


**9. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI 2024 report indicates that the global goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 is achievable based on current trends.
2.  India's GHI score in 2024 shows an improvement compared to its 2023 score, indicating progress in reducing hunger.
3. The report highlights the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. India's GHI score did improve from 2023 to 2024, and the report emphasizes the links between gender inequality, climate change, and food insecurity.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The report suggests that the Zero Hunger goal is unattainable based on current progress, not achievable.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**10. With reference to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The report defines financing for food security and nutrition as encompassing only public financial resources.
2. The report indicates that the world is on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger).
3. The report highlights that a significant portion of the global population faced hunger in 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The report does highlight that a substantial portion of the global population experienced hunger in 2023.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the report includes both public and private financial resources in its definition of financing for food security and nutrition. Statement 2 is incorrect because the report indicates that the world is far from achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger).  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.



**1. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a wide geographical spread or a high risk thereof, exceeding or potentially exceeding national health systems' response capabilities.  
2.  The amendments establish a global fund, directly managed by the WHO, to exclusively support pandemic preparedness in low-income countries.
3. The amendments mandate the creation of a single, unified global IHR authority under the direct supervision of the WHO Director-General.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key amendment to the IHR, 2005.  The revised definition of a pandemic emergency emphasizes the strain on national health systems, a crucial aspect often overlooked in previous iterations.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while the amendments do establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism, it doesn't specify direct WHO management nor exclusive focus on low-income countries.  The mechanism aims to address the needs and priorities of developing countries in a more collaborative and flexible manner, involving various stakeholders beyond the WHO. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the amendments call for the creation of National IHR Authorities to enhance coordination *within* countries, not a single global authority.  A global body would be a significant departure from the existing framework of national sovereignty in public health. The decentralized approach under the amended IHR emphasizes national ownership and responsibility in pandemic preparedness and response.


**2. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, consider the following statements:**

1.  In 2021-22, total health expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP exceeded 4%, while per capita THE surpassed Rs. 7,000.
2. Government Health Expenditure (GHE) constituted less than half of THE in 2021-22, indicating a significant reliance on private health financing.
3. Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) decreased significantly in 2021-22 compared to 2017-18, reflecting improvements in health insurance coverage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While THE as a percentage of GDP did increase, it reached 3.83% in 2021-22, not exceeding 4%. Similarly, per capita THE increased to Rs. 6,602, falling short of Rs. 7,000. Statement 2 is also incorrect. GHE constituted 48% of THE in 2021-22, exceeding half. This shows a significant role of government spending in healthcare. Statement 3 is incorrect. Though OOPE decreased, it still constituted a substantial 39.4% of THE, highlighting the ongoing burden of out-of-pocket healthcare costs for households.  The decrease, while positive, doesn't indicate a substantial improvement in health insurance coverage sufficient to reduce OOPE to a negligible level.  The NHA data highlights a persistent need for strengthening health insurance schemes to mitigate the financial risk associated with healthcare for individuals.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. India's GHI score improved significantly in 2024, indicating a substantial reduction in hunger levels compared to the previous year.
2. The global GHI score for 2024 suggests that achieving the Zero Hunger goal by 2030 is highly improbable given current trends.
3.  Child wasting and stunting remain significant concerns in India, despite improvements in overall GHI score.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's ranking improved from 111th to 105th, indicating some progress, the improvement wasn't significant enough to drastically alter the overall conclusion about hunger levels.  The GHI score itself still falls under the "serious" category. Statement 2 correctly reflects the overall global assessment presented in the GHI 2024 report. The alarming hunger levels in many countries make the 2030 Zero Hunger goal seem unattainable under current circumstances.  Statement 3 is also correct. Despite the improvement in India's GHI score, the report highlights the persistently high rates of child wasting and stunting, indicating the need for continued and intensified efforts to address malnutrition. The GHI report underscores the complex interplay of factors contributing to hunger, including gender inequality and climate change, and the persistent challenges in achieving food security and nutritional well-being.


**4. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

1. ANRF's funding entirely comes from the central government budget, reflecting the government's commitment to scientific advancement.
2.  The ANRF Act, 2023, subsumed the erstwhile Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) into the ANRF.
3.  The "Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)" initiative focuses solely on basic research in fundamental sciences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ANRF's funding is a combination of central government allocation (Rs 14,000 crore) and private sector contributions (Rs 36,000 crore) for the period 2023-2028.  This public-private partnership model reflects a strategic approach to bolster research and innovation.  Statement 2 is correct.  The ANRF Act, 2023, indeed subsumed the SERB into the ANRF, streamlining the national research landscape.  Statement 3 is incorrect.

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities, leveraging existing schemes and convergence.
2.  The Abhiyan's funding is entirely sourced from newly allocated funds specifically earmarked for this initiative, independent of existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.
3. PM-JUGA's coverage encompasses all villages with tribal populations, irrespective of their size or geographical location.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA's core objective is to address critical deficiencies in social infrastructure, healthcare, education, and livelihood opportunities within tribal communities. It achieves this by strategically integrating and expanding existing government schemes.  The initiative aims for comprehensive improvement through convergence and enhanced outreach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Abhiyan's funding mechanism utilizes existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. It does not involve the allocation of entirely new, independent funds. This leverages pre-existing resources for efficient implementation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While PM-JUGA aims to benefit a significant portion of the tribal population, its coverage is not all-encompassing. The Abhiyan focuses on approximately 63,000 villages, benefiting over 5 crore tribal people.  This represents a substantial yet targeted approach, not a universal coverage of all villages with tribal populations.  The selection criteria likely involve factors such as the concentration of tribal population, existing infrastructure levels, and other socio-economic indicators.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RPL evaluates knowledge and skills gained through formal, non-formal, and informal learning, not just formal learning. This broader scope allows for the recognition of diverse learning pathways.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary purpose of RPL is to integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal education system, providing opportunities for individuals to receive formal recognition for their skills and knowledge acquired outside traditional educational settings. It's about expanding access and recognition, not solely enhancing institutional quality.

Statement 3 is correct. The GER in higher education in India has indeed shown a significant increase from 23.7% in 2014-15 to 28.4% in 2021-22, indicating growth in access to higher education.  This data reflects broader educational access trends.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While many DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, the reverse is not true. Not all nomadic tribes were categorized as criminal tribes under the British regime.  The statement incorrectly implies a complete overlap between nomadic tribes and DNTs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed in 1949, not 1950, and the communities were subsequently denotified in 1952.  The precise year of repeal is a key detail often missed.

Statement 3 is correct. The Idate Commission (2017) did recommend the immediate repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act by respective states, citing concerns about its potential for harassment of DNT members.  This recommendation highlights ongoing efforts to address historical injustices and discriminatory practices.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA is indeed named after Birsa Munda, a prominent tribal leader who led the Ulgulan movement against British rule.  This naming reflects the Abhiyan's commitment to tribal empowerment and self-determination.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While providing pucca houses is a component, PM-JUGA's scope is much broader, encompassing improvements in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood opportunities for tribal communities. The comprehensive approach underscores the multifaceted nature of tribal development challenges.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While tribal villages are mapped, the monitoring and evaluation are done through the existing PM Gati Shakti Portal, not a newly established one. Using the existing portal demonstrates efficient resource management and avoids unnecessary duplication.


**1. With reference to the establishment of Foreign Higher Educational Institution (FHEI) campuses in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The University Grants Commission (UGC) grants final approval to FHEIs to set up campuses within one year of issuing a Letter of Intent (LoI).
2.  FHEIs are permitted to determine the qualifications, salary structure, and other service conditions for their faculty and staff independently.
3.  Degrees awarded at an FHEI's Indian campus will be granted under the name and seal of a designated Indian university.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC initially grants in-principal approval and issues an LoI.  The FHEI is then expected to establish its campus within two years from the date of the LoI issuance, not one year.  The timeline is crucial in understanding the procedural aspects of establishing a foreign university campus in India. The actual final approval process may take longer than a year, depending on the institution's progress.  This statement presents a shortened, incorrect timeline, acting as a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The UGC regulations grant FHEIs autonomy to decide on faculty and staff qualifications, salaries, and service conditions. This autonomy is a key incentive for attracting top foreign universities to India.  This reflects the government's intent to provide flexibility to attract high-quality international institutions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Qualifications offered at the Indian campus of the FHEI are awarded under the name and seal of the FHEI in its country of origin, not an Indian university. This ensures the international standard and recognition of the degrees awarded.  This detail is important to understand the degree's validity and recognition internationally. The statement’s error is a significant detail that tests knowledge of the regulations.


**2. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates, consider the following statements:**

2.  The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) prepares the NHA estimates with guidance from the NHA Expert Group for India but without any input from the NHA Steering Committee.
3. The NHA estimates provide a comprehensive overview of healthcare service utilization but not financial flows within India's health system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHA estimates have been released by the MoHFW since 2013-14, not 2012-13. This seemingly minor detail tests the candidate's precise recall of factual information.  A one-year difference is enough to make the statement false, highlighting the importance of accuracy in recalling dates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHATS prepares the estimates with guidance and support from *both* the NHA Steering Committee and the NHA Expert Group for India.  The omission of the Steering Committee's role is a key error, testing the candidate's understanding of the institutional framework involved in preparing the NHA estimates.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NHA estimates offer a detailed description of the financial flows within India's health system, including how funds are collected, spent, and how healthcare services are utilized.  This statement incorrectly limits the scope of the NHA estimates, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of their content.  The statement acts as a distractor by omitting a key function of the NHA.


**3. With reference to the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), consider the following statements:**

3. The GNAFC produces the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) annually, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GNAFC was launched in 2016, not 2015.  The one-year discrepancy is a crucial detail that distinguishes between correct and incorrect knowledge.  This tests the candidate's ability to accurately recall dates associated with significant global initiatives.

Statement 2 is correct. The GNAFC aims to improve humanitarian responses and reduce the number of people facing acute food insecurity. This is a core objective, highlighting the organization's focus and work.  Understanding the GNAFC's goals is essential for comprehending its role in global food security.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GRFC is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), not in collaboration with the WHO. The substitution of the FSIN with the WHO is a subtle but significant error, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the GRFC's production process.  This error acts as a distractor, requiring a deeper understanding of the GNAFC's activities.


**4. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a "wide geographical spread" or a high risk of one, exceeding the capacity of regional health systems to respond.
2.  The amendments establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to address the needs and priorities of developing countries and high-income nations equally.
3. The amendments create National IHR Authorities to improve coordination among countries but not a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendment defines a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a "wide geographical spread" or a high risk of one, exceeding or capable of exceeding the ability of *national* health systems to respond, not regional health systems. The substitution of "regional" for "national" is a crucial detail that tests the candidate's precise understanding of the amendment's wording.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The amendments establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to address the needs and priorities of *developing* countries, not high-income nations equally.  This statement misrepresents the focus of the financial mechanism, which prioritizes support for countries with limited resources.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the global health equity considerations embedded within the IHR amendments.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The amendments create both National IHR Authorities and a States Parties Committee to improve coordination and implementation. The omission of the States Parties Committee is a significant error, highlighting the importance of understanding the comprehensive nature of the amendments.  The error serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the institutional structures established by the IHR amendments.


**5. With reference to the  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD was adopted in Geneva in 2006 and entered into force in 2007.
2. The UN-CRPD aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, but not to promote respect for their inherent dignity.
3. The UN-CRPD includes persons with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, excluding those with temporary disabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD was adopted in New York in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, not 2007. The one-year discrepancy in the entry-into-force date is a crucial detail that tests the candidate's precise recall of factual information related to international human rights conventions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, *and* to promote respect for their inherent dignity.  The omission of "and to promote respect for their inherent dignity" is a key error, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of the convention's objectives.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The UN-CRPD definition includes persons with long-term impairments; the exclusion of those with temporary disabilities is not part of the definition.  This statement misrepresents the scope of the convention's coverage, requiring a deeper understanding of the definition of disability within the UN-CRPD framework.  The inclusion/exclusion of temporary disabilities is a key component of the understanding of the convention's scope.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-JUGA aims to improve socio-economic conditions through convergence of different schemes focusing on social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood, not solely healthcare.  This statement narrowly defines the scope of PM-JUGA, demonstrating a lack of understanding of its multi-faceted approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PM-JUGA is funded from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  This statement incorrectly suggests a new source of funding, revealing a misunderstanding of the scheme's financial mechanism.

Statement 3 is correct. PM-JUGA includes initiatives like promoting tribal homestays and focusing on sustainable livelihoods for forest rights holders.  This demonstrates an understanding of the scheme's specific components and its approach to improving livelihoods.  The inclusion of these specific initiatives highlights a grasp of the scheme's practical implementation.


**7. With reference to the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) assessment, consider the following statements:**

1. The NQAS assessment is launched for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) based on the standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO).
2. The Spot Food License initiative aims to simplify the licensing and registration processes through the Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS).
3. The NQAS assessment is a paper-based system for evaluating compliance with Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NQAS assessment is launched for AAM and IPHL in compliance with *Indian* Public Health Standards (IPHS), not WHO standards.  This statement incorrectly attributes the standards to the WHO, demonstrating a lack of knowledge about the national framework governing public health facilities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Spot Food License initiative aims to simplify licensing and registration through FoSCoS, a pan-India IT platform.  This highlights an understanding of the initiative's purpose and technological basis.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NQAS assessment is a *virtual* assessment, not a paper-based system.  This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the assessment's methodology and its use of technology.  The use of technology in the assessment is a key feature, and its misrepresentation highlights a lack of understanding of the initiative.


**8. With reference to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) report, consider the following statements:**

1. GAIN's report, "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains," focuses exclusively on increasing agricultural productivity to improve nutrition.
2. The report argues that investments in nutritious foods value chains can reduce gender inequalities and enhance business resilience.
3. The report advocates for increased government regulation of the food industry to ensure better nutrition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While increasing productivity is a component, GAIN's report also addresses gender inequalities and business resilience in relation to nutritious food value chains.  This statement oversimplifies the report's scope, demonstrating a lack of understanding of its multi-faceted approach.

Statement 2 is correct.  The report directly links investments in nutritious foods value chains to reduced gender inequalities and enhanced business resilience.  This demonstrates an understanding of the report's core argument and its policy implications.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report does not advocate for increased government regulation but focuses on investment in nutritious food value chains.  This statement misrepresents the report's policy recommendations, highlighting a lack of understanding of its approach.  The absence of a call for increased regulation is a key aspect of the report's approach.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Dhebar Committee (1960-61) recommended the recognition of 75 PVTGs, with Odisha having the highest number among all states and Union Territories.
2.  Criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural existence, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy.  
3. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme with 50% Central assistance, primarily focusing on education and housing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dhebar Committee indeed recommended the recognition of 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one UT, and Odisha holds the distinction of having the highest number of recognized PVTGs.

Statement 2 is also correct. The criteria for identifying PVTGs accurately reflect the socio-economic characteristics outlined in the provided text:  dependence on forest resources, a pre-agricultural lifestyle, demographic stagnation or decline, low literacy rates, and a subsistence economy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The scheme is a *centrally sponsored scheme with 100% Central assistance*, not 50%. While education and housing are components, the scheme encompasses a broader range of interventions including agricultural development, infrastructure strengthening, and social security measures.  The percentage of central funding is a crucial detail, highlighting the level of government commitment, and its misrepresentation makes the statement factually inaccurate.


**2. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA) and Habitat Rights, consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines 'habitat' as the area encompassing customary habitat and other habitats within reserved and protected forests exclusively for primitive tribal groups.
2.  Habitat rights are granted to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) under Section 3(1)(f) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006.
3.  Tribes in Madhya Pradesh granted habitat rights under the FRA include the Bharias, while Odisha includes the Paudi Bhuyans, Saora tribals, and Juangs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but requires a nuanced understanding. The FRA's definition of 'habitat' includes customary habitat and other habitats within reserved and protected forests, but it is not *exclusively* for primitive tribal groups.  The definition extends to pre-agricultural communities and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes as well.  The exclusivity mentioned makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The correct section is  Section 3(1)(e), not 3(1)(f).  This seemingly minor detail is significant for UPSC-level accuracy.

Statement 3 is correct. The Bharias in Madhya Pradesh and the mentioned tribes in Odisha are indeed examples of groups that have been granted habitat rights under the FRA.  The list of tribes provided accurately reflects the information given in the source text.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence of various schemes, building upon the successes of PM-JANMAN.
2.  The scheme's funding is entirely from newly allocated funds specifically designated for the initiative, independent of existing Development Action Plans for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST).
3. PM-JUGA, named after Birsa Munda,  includes initiatives like Tribal Home Stays to promote tourism and the improvement of Government residential schools/hostels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA's objective is to address critical gaps in various sectors by converging existing schemes, learning from the PM-JANMAN experience.  This is a core element of the Abhiyan's design.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The scheme utilizes *existing* DAPST grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  The funding mechanism is a key aspect of the program's implementation and its misrepresentation makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 3 is correct.  The scheme is indeed named after Birsa Munda and includes the mentioned initiatives: Tribal Home Stays under Swadesh Darshan and upgrading of government schools/hostels.  These are specific examples of the program's components.


**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, indicates that hunger levels in 42 countries are at alarming levels, making the 2030 Zero Hunger goal unattainable.
2. India's GHI score improved in 2024, falling into the "serious" category with a score of 27.3, primarily due to improvements in child wasting and stunting.
3. The GHI report highlights the correlation between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, emphasizing the disproportionate impact on women and girls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GHI 2024 report accurately reflects the alarming hunger levels in numerous countries, jeopardizing the 2030 Zero Hunger goal.  This is a major finding of the report.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's ranking improved (from 111th to 105th), the statement incorrectly states that this improvement is due to improvements in child wasting and stunting.  The report actually indicates that child wasting and stunting remain very high in India.  The misrepresentation of the data concerning child health indicators makes this statement incorrect.

Statement 3 is correct.  The GHI report explicitly highlights the link between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, showing the disproportionate impact on women and girls. This is a key aspect of the report's analysis.


**5. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

3.  The National Board of Accreditation (NBA), in collaboration with INFLIBNET Centre, implements the NIRF rankings, assessing qualitative competence of programs offered by educational institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NIRF 2024 rankings did introduce the new categories mentioned, and IIT Madras did top the Overall category.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement incorrectly claims that Innovation is *excluded*.  The text explicitly states that "Integration of “Innovation” ranking into the India Rankings using NIRF framework" occurred.  The omission of this crucial detail makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The NBA and INFLIBNET Centre's role in implementing the NIRF and their assessment methods are accurately described.


**7. With reference to Foreign University Campuses in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The University of Southampton, United Kingdom, is the first international university to establish a campus in India under the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023.
2.  The UGC regulations require foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) to be ranked within the global top 500 overall or in relevant subject areas to be eligible to establish campuses in India.
3.  The UGC regulations permit only a single FHEI to establish a campus in India, prohibiting collaborations between multiple institutions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text confirms that the University of Southampton is the first to receive approval.

Statement 2 is correct. The regulations do stipulate that FHEIs must meet the top 500 ranking criterion or demonstrate outstanding expertise in a specific area.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The regulations explicitly state that *two or more FHEIs can collaborate*, provided each meets the eligibility criteria individually.  This key detail about collaborative possibilities makes the statement incorrect.


**1. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency to include only communicable diseases with exceptionally high mortality rates exceeding 10%.
2.  A new global fund, entirely funded by high-income nations, will be established to support pandemic preparedness in low-income countries.
3. The amendments mandate the creation of national IHR authorities in all WHO member states, headed by a physician with at least 20 years of experience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 incorrectly restricts the definition of a pandemic emergency to diseases with exceptionally high mortality rates; the actual amendment focuses on "wide geographical spread" or a high risk of one, and exceeding national health system response capabilities.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the  amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism, not a solely high-income nation-funded global fund. While the goal is to assist developing countries, the funding source isn't exclusively limited to high-income nations.  Statement 3 is also inaccurate. The amendments call for the creation of National IHR Authorities to improve coordination, but they don't specify the qualifications or experience required for the head of these authorities.  The amendments aim for better preparedness and response mechanisms, but the details provided in the statements are incorrect or overly specific. The UPSC would value the understanding of the broader goals of the IHR amendments and the general framework for improved global health security.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA is solely funded through newly allocated budgetary provisions specifically earmarked for tribal development.
2. The scheme prioritizes the development of sustainable tourism initiatives in tribal areas, with a focus on establishing at least 5,000 tribal homestays.
3.  PM-JUGA aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities by converging existing schemes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. PM-JUGA leverages existing schemes and grants (like DAPST) for convergence and outreach, not solely relying on new allocations.  Statement 2 is incorrect in its specific target of 5,000 homestays; the scheme aims to promote 1000 homestays under Swadesh Darshan.  Statement 1 is incorrect because it misrepresents the funding source.  A crucial understanding for the UPSC would be recognizing the importance of convergence in government schemes and the strategic use of existing resources for achieving development goals.  The ability to differentiate between the stated goals and the specific numerical targets is also important.


**3. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2006, with India ratifying it in 2010.
2. The convention defines persons with disabilities as those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments which may hinder full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.
3. The UN-CRPD's primary objective is to ensure the provision of specialized schools and segregated living arrangements for persons with disabilities to protect them from societal discrimination.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 accurately reflects a key aspect of the UN-CRPD.  Statement 1 is partially incorrect regarding the ratification date; while the convention was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, India's ratification date is not specified in the provided text. Statement 3 is fundamentally wrong.  The UN-CRPD promotes inclusion and full participation in society, not segregation.  The UPSC would expect candidates to understand the core principles of the UN-CRPD, which emphasizes the rights of persons with disabilities and their right to inclusion and participation in all aspects of life.  The inclusion of misleading statements about segregation highlights the importance of understanding the convention's true intent.


**4. With reference to the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), consider the following statements:**

1. The GNAFC was established in 2010 by the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Oxfam International.
2. The GNAFC primarily focuses on providing emergency food aid to conflict-affected regions, neglecting the underlying causes of food crises.
3. The GNAFC produces an annual report on global food crises, providing data and analysis on acute food insecurity worldwide.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The GNAFC does indeed produce the Global Report on Food Crises annually. Statement 1 is incorrect about the founding year and organizations; it was launched in 2016 by the European Union, FAO, and WFP. Statement 2 is incorrect because the GNAFC aims to address the root causes of food crises, not just provide emergency aid.  The UPSC would look for an understanding of the GNAFC's role in tackling food insecurity, its collaborative nature, and the information it provides through its annual reports. The inclusion of incorrect details about founding members and focus areas tests the candidate's knowledge of the GNAFC's actual mandate and activities.


**5. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The report shows that food waste in high-income countries is significantly lower than in low-income countries.
2. Food waste contributes to approximately 15-20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
3. The report tracks food waste at the production, retail, and consumer levels, providing data on both edible and inedible parts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is completely accurate. The report does indeed track food waste across all stages of the supply chain, including both edible and inedible parts.  Statement 1 is not explicitly supported by the given information; it needs further data to confirm. Statement 2 overestimates the contribution of food waste to greenhouse gas emissions; the report states it's 8-10%. The UPSC would value an understanding of the scope of the Food Waste Index Report and its significance in addressing SDG 12.3.  The inclusion of potentially misleading information about the relative contribution of food waste across income levels and its impact on greenhouse gas emissions tests the candidate's ability to critically evaluate the information provided.


**6. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates for India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHA estimates are prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).
2. Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP has consistently declined since 2017-18.
3. The NHA estimates provide a comprehensive overview of financial flows within India's health system, including government and private spending.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The NHA estimates do offer a detailed picture of financial flows in India's health system. Statement 1 is incorrect; the estimates are prepared by the NHATS, not the WHO. Statement 2 is incorrect as the THE as a percentage of GDP increased, not declined.  The UPSC would assess the candidate's understanding of the NHA estimates, their purpose, and the information they provide about health financing in India.  The incorrect statements about the preparers of the estimates and the trend in THE as a percentage of GDP serve as effective distractors.


**7. With reference to the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report, consider the following statements:**

1. NFHS-5 is conducted every five years by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).
2. The survey collects data on various health indicators, including maternal and child health, nutrition, and family planning.
3.  NFHS-5 data shows a significant increase in the total fertility rate across all states of India compared to NFHS-4.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. NFHS surveys are conducted periodically by MoHFW, and cover a wide range of health indicators.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the provided text doesn't give the exact figures, it doesn't support a general increase in total fertility rates across all states.  The UPSC would test the candidate's knowledge of the NFHS surveys, their purpose, and the kind of data they collect.  The inclusion of a potentially misleading statement about fertility rates acts as a crucial distractor.


**8. With reference to the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The regulations allow only the top 100 globally ranked universities to establish campuses in India.
2. Foreign universities establishing campuses in India must follow all Indian regulations regarding faculty appointments, curriculum, and fee structures.
3. The UGC grants final approval for the establishment of a foreign university campus in India only after the campus is fully operational.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate. Statement 1 is wrong because the regulations specify a ranking within the top 500, not just the top 100. Statement 2 is incorrect; while Indian regulations apply, the regulations allow for some autonomy to foreign universities in areas such as faculty appointments and salary structures.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the UGC initially grants in-principle approval and an LoI, with the expectation of campus setup within two years. The UPSC would evaluate the candidate's grasp of the regulations governing the establishment of foreign university campuses in India.  The incorrect statements serve to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between the actual regulations and potential misconceptions.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1. The RPwD Act mandates a 2% reservation for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in government jobs and higher educational institutions.
2.  The Act introduces the concept of "limited guardianship" for PwDs who cannot make legally binding decisions, even with support, restricting it to specific decisions and timeframes.
3. The Act directs the government to create social security programs ensuring PwDs achieve an adequate standard of living, enabling independent or community-based living.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a 5%, not 2%, reservation for PwDs in government jobs and government-aided higher educational institutions.  The 4% reservation in government jobs mentioned in the source text refers to the earlier legislation and is not consistent with the 2016 Act's provisions.  This discrepancy creates a plausible distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the current legal framework.

Statement 2 is correct. The RPwD Act does indeed introduce the concept of "limited guardianship," a mechanism designed to support PwDs' decision-making without completely removing their autonomy.  The description emphasizes the joint decision-making aspect and its limited scope, reflecting the nuanced approach of the Act.

Statement 3 is also correct. The Act explicitly mandates the government to formulate and implement social security programs to ensure PwDs have an adequate standard of living, promoting both independent living and community integration. This highlights the Act's commitment to comprehensive welfare.


**2. With reference to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The IHR, 2005, was preceded by the International Sanitary Regulations of 1961, aiming to establish a legally binding framework for international public health emergencies.
2.  Recent amendments to the IHR define a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with widespread geographical distribution exceeding national health system response capabilities, irrespective of the mortality rate.
3. The amendments established a global financial mechanism to exclusively support high-income countries in managing pandemic emergencies, prioritizing equitable resource allocation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The source mentions that the IHR, 2005, is the successor to the International Sanitary Regulations of 1951, not 1961. This subtle alteration in the date serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's attention to detail.  The core function of establishing a legally binding framework remains accurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The amendments to the IHR redefine a pandemic emergency based on geographical spread and the strain on national health systems, accurately reflecting the changes mentioned in the source. The statement correctly points out the key criteria for defining a pandemic emergency.  It avoids specific details like mortality rate, which might be misleading or subject to interpretation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the amendments did establish a coordinating financial mechanism, it is designed to address the needs of developing countries, not exclusively high-income countries. The statement introduces a deliberate distortion of the actual purpose, testing the candidate's understanding of the equity aspects of international health cooperation.


**3. With reference to Foreign Education Institutions (FEIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The University Grants Commission (UGC) grants final approval to FEIs seeking to establish campuses in India after a comprehensive on-site inspection and verification of their infrastructure and faculty.
2. FEIs operating in India under UGC guidelines are permitted to award degrees under their own name and seal, but these degrees must be recognized by the Indian government for employment purposes.
3.  Student mobility and credit transfers are permitted between the main campus of an FEI and its Indian campus, and between Indian institutions and FEI campuses in India, subject to UGC approval.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC initially grants in-principle approval and issues a Letter of Intent (LoI), not final approval, to applicant FEIs.  The final approval process is not described explicitly in the provided text, making this a plausible distractor.  The statement mistakenly implies a more stringent and immediate final approval process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The source states that the qualifications offered in the Indian campus of the FEI are awarded under the name and seal of the FEI in the country of origin. It does not mention the need for Indian government recognition for employment purposes.  This creates a plausible misconception, testing the candidate's understanding of international degree recognition and equivalence.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly permits student mobility and credit transfers between the main FEI campus and the Indian campus, and between Indian institutions and FEI campuses in India. This statement accurately reflects the information provided in the source.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates in India:**

1.  The NHA estimates, released annually by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), provide a comprehensive financial overview of the Indian healthcare system, detailing revenue streams, expenditure patterns, and service utilization since 2010-11.
2. The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS), under the guidance of the NHA Steering Committee, compiles the NHA estimates using the System of Health Accounts, 2011 framework.
3. The NHA estimates include detailed information on out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure, but exclude data on healthcare expenditure by the private sector due to data limitations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The source indicates that the MoHFW has released the NHA estimates since 2013-14, not 2010-11.  The slight alteration in the starting year creates a potential distractor, requiring candidates to have precise recall. The rest of the statement accurately describes the nature of the NHA estimates.

Statement 2 is correct. The source accurately describes the NHATS' role in compiling the estimates, the guidance provided by the NHA Steering Committee, and the use of the System of Health Accounts, 2011, framework. This statement accurately reflects the organizational and methodological aspects of the NHA.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The source does not indicate that private sector expenditure is excluded from the NHA estimates.  The statement introduces a false claim about data limitations, testing the candidate's knowledge of the comprehensiveness of the NHA data.  It is a strong distractor because it plays on common assumptions about the challenges of data collection in the private sector.


**1. With reference to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The IHR 2005 replaced the International Sanitary Regulations of 1961, aiming to establish a legally binding framework for managing cross-border public health emergencies.
2.  The amendments to the IHR 2005, adopted at the 77th World Health Assembly, primarily focus on strengthening national health systems' capacities to respond to pandemics by creating a global pandemic preparedness fund.
3. The IHR 2005 comprises all 194 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO), excluding observer states such as the Vatican City.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IHR (2005) is indeed the successor to the International Sanitary Regulations, aiming to create a robust, legally binding framework for nations to collaborate in addressing public health crises that transcend borders.  The 1961 date mentioned in the question is a distractor; the correct date is 1951.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the amendments did aim to improve pandemic preparedness, the mechanism created is a *Coordinating Financial Mechanism*, not a dedicated global pandemic preparedness fund. This subtle difference is designed as a distractor.  The focus is on assisting developing countries, not solely on creating a new fund.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The IHR 2005 includes all 194 WHO member states *plus* observer states like Liechtenstein and the Holy See.  The exclusion mentioned in the statement is a key distractor.


Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are factually accurate.


**2. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHA estimates, released annually by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare since 2013-14,  are prepared using the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2000, a global standard framework.
2.  The 2021-22 NHA estimates show a decrease in the percentage of Out-of-Pocket Expenditures (OOPE) on healthcare as a percentage of Total Health Expenditure (THE), indicating improved healthcare financing.
3. The NHA estimates provide a detailed breakdown of India's healthcare financing, including government spending, private sector spending and social security expenditures, but does not include data on healthcare utilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NHA estimates utilize the System of Health Accounts (SHA) *2011*, not 2000.  The year difference is a subtle but important distractor.


Statement 2 is correct. The data presented in the text clearly indicates a decrease in OOPE as a percentage of THE from 2017-18 to 2021-22, suggesting an improvement in healthcare financing.


Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NHA estimates do include data on healthcare utilization, offering a comprehensive picture of the financial flows and utilization patterns within India’s health system. This is a significant distractor, playing on the complexity of the NHA.


Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.



**3. With reference to the Foreign University Campuses in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, allow only foreign universities ranked within the top 200 globally to establish campuses in India.
2.  The University of Southampton, UK, is the first foreign university to establish a campus in India under the UGC regulations of 2023, located in Mumbai.
3. Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) seeking to establish campuses in India must obtain in-principle approval from the UGC and are expected to set up their campuses within 3 years from the date of issuance of the Letter of Intent (LoI).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The regulations allow universities ranked in the global top 500, not just the top 200.  The numerical difference is a crucial distractor.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the University of Southampton is indeed one of the first, the location mentioned is incorrect; it's in Gurugram, not Mumbai.  The city change serves as a distractor.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The timeframe for setting up the campus is 2 years, not 3.  The one-year difference is a key distractor.


Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA):**

1. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by focusing solely on providing financial assistance and skill development programs.
2. The scheme is named after Birsa Munda and is based on the learnings and success of PM-JANMAN, a similar program focusing on the welfare of Scheduled Castes.
3. PM-JUGA envisages convergence and outreach of various existing schemes to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood aspects within tribal communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PM-JUGA's scope is broader than just financial aid and skill development; it encompasses infrastructure development, healthcare improvements, educational enhancements, and livelihood opportunities.  This oversimplification is a distractor.


Statement 2 is partially correct in that it's named after Birsa Munda, but incorrect in that PM-JANMAN focuses on Scheduled Tribes, not Scheduled Castes. This subtle difference is a significant distractor.


Statement 3 is correct.  The scheme explicitly aims for convergence and outreach of different programs to address multiple needs within tribal communities.


Therefore, only statement 3 is fully accurate.


**5. With reference to the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report, consider the following statements:**

1. The NFHS-5 report provides comprehensive data on maternal and child health indicators, but excludes data on nutrition and sanitation.
2. NFHS-5 data collection was conducted in all states and union territories of India, including those with limited access to healthcare infrastructure.
3. The NFHS-5 report is released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and its findings are used for policy formulation and program implementation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NFHS-5 reports extensively on nutrition and sanitation alongside maternal and child health. This omission of key components is a significant distractor.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While NFHS-5 aimed for broad coverage, data collection might have faced challenges in areas with limited access.  The assumption of complete coverage is a distractor.


Statement 3 is correct.  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is indeed responsible for releasing the report and utilizing its findings for policy decisions.


Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.  The other statements contain plausible but incorrect details, testing the candidate's knowledge of the survey's scope and limitations.


**1. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with limited geographical spread and exceeding national health system response capabilities.
2.  A States Parties Committee was established to ensure effective IHR implementation, with a focus on developed countries' assistance to developing nations.
3. The amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism to address the needs of developed countries primarily, prioritizing their existing public health infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 incorrectly describes the geographical spread; the amendments define a pandemic emergency as having a "wide geographical spread" or a high risk of one, exceeding national response capabilities. Statement 2 misrepresents the committee's focus; the States Parties Committee aims for effective IHR implementation across all member states,  with a specific emphasis on assisting developing countries. Statement 3 is incorrect because the coordinating financial mechanism is explicitly designed to address the needs and priorities of *developing* countries, acknowledging their often-limited resources in handling public health emergencies.  The amendments aim to improve global preparedness and response to pandemics by strengthening international cooperation and resource allocation, particularly for nations lacking robust health systems.


**2. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-CRPD, adopted in 2006 and entering into force in 2008, aims to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities, excluding those with temporary impairments.
2.  India is among the 164 signatories to the UN-CRPD, committing to providing 5% reservation in government jobs and higher education for persons with disabilities, irrespective of the type of disability.
3. The UN-CRPD mandates the formulation of government programs for the social security of persons with disabilities, focusing primarily on institutional care rather than community-based support.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are completely accurate. Statement 1 is partially correct in its aim but excludes a crucial element. The convention includes persons with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, encompassing those with both temporary and permanent disabilities. Statement 2 is partially correct in mentioning India's signatory status and reservation policies. However, it oversimplifies the reservation policy, which is not universally 5% across all government jobs and higher education institutions and varies based on the type of disability. Statement 3 is incorrect in its emphasis on institutional care. While the UN-CRPD does mandate social security programs, it strongly promotes community-based support and independent living, emphasizing inclusion and participation in society.  The convention aims for a holistic approach to the rights and well-being of persons with disabilities, promoting their full and equal integration into society.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  PM-JUGA, named after Birsa Munda, focuses on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing gaps in social infrastructure and providing livelihood support exclusively through newly created schemes.
2. The scheme utilizes funds solely from newly allocated grants, independent of existing development action plans for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST).
3. PM-JUGA draws lessons from the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN) to achieve its objectives of convergence and outreach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect because PM-JUGA leverages existing schemes and programs to improve tribal communities' socio-economic conditions, not solely through new initiatives.  It aims for convergence of various schemes for better impact. Statement 2 is incorrect as PM-JUGA utilizes funding from the existing DAPST grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  Statement 3 correctly identifies that PM-JUGA builds on the experiences and successes of PM-JANMAN, applying those learnings for improved effectiveness.  PM-JUGA's focus is on a holistic approach to tribal development, integrating various government programs and initiatives for a more comprehensive impact.


**4. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The POSH Act mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations with fewer than 10 employees, ensuring that all workplaces have mechanisms for addressing sexual harassment.
2.  The ICC composition requires at least half of its members to be women, with the Presiding Officer being a man to ensure objectivity and impartiality.
3. The POSH Act defines sexual harassment in line with the Supreme Court's Vishaka judgment, providing a comprehensive legal framework for addressing workplace harassment and providing remedies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; the POSH Act mandates ICCs in organizations with 10 or *more* employees, not fewer.  Smaller workplaces may fall under the purview of the Local Complaints Committee (LCC). Statement 2 is incorrect because the Presiding Officer of the ICC must be a woman, not a man, to ensure representation and sensitivity to the issues faced by women.  Statement 3 correctly states that the POSH Act aligns its definition of sexual harassment with the Supreme Court's Vishaka judgment, providing a robust legal framework for addressing complaints and providing appropriate remedies.  The Act aims to create a safe and respectful workplace environment for women, free from harassment and discrimination.


**5. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ANRF, established under the ANRF Act 2023, subsumed the erstwhile Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), focusing solely on funding research in established institutions.
2. The ANRF's "Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)" initiative supports research solely in basic sciences, aiming to enhance fundamental knowledge without application-oriented goals.
3. The ANRF's governance structure includes a Governing Board chaired by the Prime Minister and an Executive Council chaired by the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**6. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHA estimates, released annually since 2013-14, provide a comprehensive overview of India's healthcare financing, excluding private health insurance expenditures.
2. The NHA estimates are prepared by the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS), independent of any external guidance or support.
3. The NHA estimates illustrate the financial flows within India's health system, showcasing how funds are collected and spent, along with healthcare service utilization data.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHA estimates *do* include private health insurance expenditures, providing a complete picture of healthcare financing.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the NHATS prepares the estimates under the guidance and support of the NHA Steering Committee and NHA Expert Group for India. Statement 3 accurately reflects the NHA's purpose – to provide a detailed analysis of financial flows within India's health system, including fund sources, expenditure patterns, and healthcare service utilization. The NHA estimates are crucial for policymaking and resource allocation in the healthcare sector, offering valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.


**7. With reference to euthanasia and related legal pronouncements, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court's 2011 judgment in Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug vs UOI established the legality of both passive and active euthanasia in India.
2. The 2018 Common Cause vs. Union of India & Anr. case upheld the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right under Article 21, but only permitted passive euthanasia.
3. The 2023 Supreme Court guidelines on living wills mandate that a living will must be attested by a notary or gazetted officer to be legally valid, and only one guardian can be named.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; the 2011 Aruna Shanbaug judgment recognized the legality of *passive* euthanasia, not active euthanasia. Active euthanasia, involving direct action to end a life, remains illegal in India. Statement 3 is partially incorrect; while attestation by a notary or gazetted officer is sufficient, the 2023 guidelines allow for *more* than one guardian to be named in the living will. Statement 2 accurately reflects the 2018 Common Cause judgment, which affirmed the right to die with dignity under Article 21 and permitted passive euthanasia under specific conditions.  The legal framework around euthanasia in India is complex and evolving, balancing individual autonomy with ethical considerations and the protection of vulnerable individuals.


**8. With reference to child marriage and government measures to prevent it, consider the following statements:**

1. The new law in Sierra Leone penalizes only those directly involved in child marriages, excluding individuals who enable or facilitate such marriages.
2. The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme solely focuses on preventing child marriages, without addressing other aspects of girls' empowerment.
3. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, includes provisions for the care and protection of children at imminent risk of child marriage.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Sierra Leone law penalizes both those directly involved in child marriages and those who enable or facilitate them. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme addresses broader issues of girls' empowerment, including education and challenging gender stereotypes, in addition to preventing child marriages. Statement 3 accurately reflects that the Juvenile Justice Act includes provisions for the care and protection of children at risk of child marriage.  Government efforts to combat child marriage involve a multi-pronged approach, including legal frameworks, social awareness campaigns, and support services for vulnerable children and families.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dhebar Committee's recommendations formed the basis for recognizing 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory.
2.  Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs, exceeding all other states and Union Territories.
3.  Criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural existence, and a consistently growing population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The government's recognition of PVTGs is indeed based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Committee (1960-61).  This committee played a crucial role in identifying and categorizing these groups based on their unique vulnerabilities.

Statement 2 is also correct. Odisha does house the largest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and Union Territories. This highlights the significant presence and diversity of particularly vulnerable tribal populations within Odisha.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While forest-based livelihoods and pre-agricultural existence are criteria, a *stagnant or declining* population, not a growing one, is a key characteristic used to identify PVTGs.  This reflects the vulnerability and often precarious situation of these groups.  A growing population would generally not be considered an indicator of vulnerability.


**2. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, consider the following statements:**

1.  The FRA defines 'habitat' as encompassing only the customary habitat of primitive tribal groups within reserved forests.
2.  Habitat rights under the FRA are granted solely based on self-declarations by the concerned tribal communities.
3.  The Bharias of Madhya Pradesh and the Kamars and Baigas of Chhattisgarh are among the tribal groups recognized under the FRA for habitat rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FRA's definition of 'habitat' is broader; it includes customary habitats *and* other habitats in reserved and protected forests for primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.  The definition goes beyond just customary habitats within reserved forests.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The grant of habitat rights under the FRA involves a sequence of consultations with various stakeholders, not just self-declarations. This process ensures a more comprehensive and participatory approach to recognizing and securing these rights.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Bharias of Madhya Pradesh and the Kamars and Baigas of Chhattisgarh are examples of tribal groups who have been recognized for habitat rights under the FRA. This highlights the practical application of the Act in securing land and resource rights for vulnerable communities.


**3. With reference to the 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme exclusively focuses on providing financial assistance for skill development programs.
2.  The scheme is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with 100% Central assistance.
3. The scheme employs a micro-plan approach involving the formulation of Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While skill development is a component, the scheme's scope is far broader. It encompasses various aspects of socio-economic development, including education, housing, agricultural development, infrastructure strengthening, and social security measures.  It's not solely focused on skills.

Statement 2 is correct. The scheme is indeed a Centrally Sponsored Scheme fully funded by the central government. This ensures consistent and dedicated resources for the targeted development initiatives.

Statement 3 is correct.  The scheme utilizes a micro-plan approach, employing the formulation of Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans.  This approach ensures a targeted and context-specific strategy for the socio-economic upliftment of PVTGs while preserving their cultural heritage.


**4. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, and education exclusively through newly created schemes.
2. The scheme's funding is entirely sourced from a newly established fund specifically for tribal development.
3.  The scheme draws lessons and success from the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM-JUGA aims to address critical gaps through *convergence* of existing schemes and outreach, not exclusively through new schemes. This strategy leverages existing resources and frameworks for a more efficient and impactful approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The scheme's funding is sourced from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It does not rely on a newly established fund.

Statement 3 is correct.  PM-JUGA explicitly draws upon the learnings and successes of PM-JANMAN. This reflects a deliberate effort to build upon previous successful initiatives and refine strategies for tribal development.


**5. With reference to the  amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency to include only communicable diseases with a high mortality rate.
2. The amendments establish a coordinating financial mechanism primarily for high-income countries.
3. The amendments mandate the creation of National IHR Authorities to improve coordination among countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments broaden the definition of a pandemic emergency; it includes communicable diseases with "wide geographical spread" or a high risk of one, exceeding national health system response capabilities.  Mortality rate is not the sole criterion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The coordinating financial mechanism is designed to address the needs and priorities of *developing* countries, not high-income countries. This reflects a focus on equitable access to resources and support for nations with limited capacities.

Statement 3 is correct. The amendments do mandate the creation of National IHR Authorities to strengthen coordination and response capabilities at the national level. This is a crucial aspect of enhancing global preparedness and response to public health emergencies.


**6. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. Iceland, Finland, and Norway consistently rank among the top three countries globally in the report.
2. The report indicates that the global gender gap has been completely closed in 2024.
3. India's ranking improved significantly in 2024 compared to 2023 in the report.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Iceland, Finland, and Norway consistently feature among the top three countries in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report.  Their consistent high rankings highlight their progress in achieving gender parity across various dimensions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report shows that a significant portion of the global gender gap has been closed, but it has *not* been completely closed. The report typically provides a percentage indicating the progress made toward full gender parity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India's ranking showed a slight decline in 2024 compared to 2023, not a significant improvement. This indicates that while some progress might have been made in certain areas, overall gender parity remains a significant challenge in India.


**7. With reference to the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, consider the following statements:**

1. A GII score of 0 indicates complete gender equality, while a score of 1 indicates maximum inequality.
2. In the GII 2022, India's ranking improved considerably compared to the 2021 ranking.
3. Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland consistently rank among the top three countries in the GII.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GII score uses a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 represents complete gender equality (men and women fare equally) and 1 represents maximum gender inequality (one gender fares as poorly as possible). This scoring system provides a clear metric for comparing gender inequality across different countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's GII ranking in 2022 showed an *improvement* compared to 2021, but it wasn't a considerable jump.  The improvement was modest, indicating ongoing challenges in addressing gender inequality.

Statement 3 is correct. Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland consistently rank among the top three countries with the lowest GII scores, indicating high levels of gender equality. Their consistently high rankings highlight their success in promoting gender parity.


**8.  With reference to the  University Grants Commission (UGC) Regulations, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The regulations aim to restrict the entry of foreign universities into India's higher education system.
2.  The regulations stipulate that only foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) ranked within the global top 100 can establish campuses in India.
3.  The UGC grants initial in-principle approval and issues a Letter of Intent (LoI) to applicant FHEIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The regulations aim to *facilitate*, not restrict, the entry of high-ranked foreign universities into India's higher education system.  This is in line with the objectives of the National Education Policy 2020.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The regulations specify that FHEIs ranked within the global top 500, either overall or in relevant subject areas, or possessing outstanding expertise in a particular area, are eligible to establish campuses in India.  The top 100 is not the sole criterion.

Statement 3 is correct. The UGC does grant initial in-principle approval and issues a Letter of Intent (LoI) to applicant FHEIs. This two-step process ensures a thorough evaluation and approval mechanism before the establishment of foreign university campuses in India.


**9. With reference to the  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes, consider the following statements:**

1. All nomadic tribes are denotified tribes (DNTs), but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Supreme Court's ruling in Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others highlighted caste-based discrimination in prisons affecting DNTs.
3. Pastoral communities such as Pardis, Gujjars, Banjaras, and Bhils are exclusively hunter-gatherer groups.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The relationship between nomadic tribes and DNTs is the opposite:  All DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  DNTs represent a subset of nomadic communities that faced specific historical categorization.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court case highlighted the persistent caste-based discrimination within prisons, specifically targeting DNTs and those labeled "habitual offenders." This ruling underscores the systemic inequalities faced by these marginalized communities.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Pastoral communities like Pardis, Gujjars, Banjaras, and Bhils are primarily *pastoralists*, not exclusively hunter-gatherers.  While some nomadic groups might engage in hunting and gathering, these particular communities are characterized by their dependence on livestock rearing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NADA's #PlayTrue campaign aligns with WADA's Play True Day, a global awareness initiative promoting clean sport.  While the exact date might vary slightly year to year, the core concept of the campaign remains consistent with WADA's annual observance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, deals with illegal narcotics and psychotropic substances, not specifically with the comprehensive anti-doping rules and regulations enforced by NADA.  NADA's legal framework is more extensive and nuanced, encompassing specific sports-related regulations and international anti-doping codes.  The NDPS Act is a separate legal instrument dealing with a different, albeit related, area of prohibited substances.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  NADA's anti-doping helpline is not exclusively for elite international athletes.  It aims to provide information and guidance to a broader range of athletes and support personnel, including those at the national and even grassroots levels, to promote awareness and understanding of anti-doping rules.  Restricting the helpline to only elite athletes would be a misallocation of resources and would undermine the agency's overall goal of clean sport.


**2. With reference to multilingualism initiatives in Indian education, consider the following statements:**

3. The Real-time Translation Architecture is a comprehensive multilingual dictionary repository, aiming to provide a centralized source for various Indian languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Asmita Project aims to produce 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages over five years, not three. The timeframe and the total number of books are crucial elements of the project's scope.  A shorter timeframe would suggest a significantly accelerated and potentially less thorough process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is the multilingual dictionary repository, not a real-time translation platform. The description confuses the roles of the two different initiatives.  The real-time translation architecture is a separate project focused on technological advancements in translation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Real-time Translation Architecture is the technology-driven initiative, not the multilingual dictionary.  The statement incorrectly attributes the dictionary function to the technology platform. The Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is the dictionary, while the Real-time Translation Architecture is the technological infrastructure designed to aid in translation work.

3. Project NAMAN's implementation is limited to urban areas, focusing on major cities to ensure efficient delivery of services to a concentrated population of veterans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Project NAMAN's scope extends beyond just retired personnel.  While it prioritizes serving retired personnel, veterans, and their families, the project's aim is broader, encompassing the provision of support and services to a wider range of beneficiaries within the defense community.

Statement 2 is correct.  Project NAMAN leverages the SPARSH (System for Pension Administration Raksha) system for efficient and streamlined service delivery.  SPARSH is indeed a crucial component of the project's functionality.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Project NAMAN's implementation is not restricted to urban areas.  The goal is to provide nationwide coverage, ensuring that veterans and their families in both urban and rural settings have access to the support services offered under the project.  Restricting it to urban centers would be a significant limitation and would exclude a considerable segment of the target population.


**4. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments redefine a pandemic emergency to include communicable diseases with a high risk of wide geographical spread, exceeding national health system response capabilities.
2. The amendments establish a global fund, entirely financed by developed nations, to exclusively support developing countries in pandemic preparedness and response.
3. The amendments create a new World Health Organization (WHO) committee to oversee the implementation of the IHR, with veto power over national health policies during emergencies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The amendments to the IHR, 2005, broadened the definition of a pandemic emergency to encompass situations where the geographical spread and the strain on national health systems exceed their capacity to respond effectively. This reflects lessons learned from past outbreaks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the amendments do establish a coordinating financial mechanism, it is not exclusively financed by developed nations nor is it solely for developing countries.  The funding mechanism is intended to be more collaborative and involve a broader range of contributors to ensure equitable access to resources for pandemic preparedness and response.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The amendments do establish a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation, but it does not have veto power over national health policies.  The committee's role is primarily focused on coordination, collaboration, and improved implementation of the regulations, not on direct control over national health policies.  Such a power would be a significant infringement on national sovereignty.

This detail is crucial for understanding the ANRF's financial backing and its reliance on both public and private investment.  Confusing the sources of funding is a common distractor in such questions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Executive Council of ANRF is chaired by the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, not the Union Minister of Science and Technology.  While the Minister holds a significant position (ex-officio Vice-President of the Governing Board), the day-to-day operational leadership of the Executive Council rests with the Principal Scientific Adviser. This highlights the importance of understanding the different governance structures within the ANRF.

2.  The NIRF framework uses six parameters for ranking educational institutions, including Teaching, Learning, and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; Perception; and Innovation.
3. The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) is the sole implementing agency for the NIRF rankings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PM-JUGA's timeframe is 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29), not 10 years. This tests the candidate's attention to detail regarding the scheme's duration.  A longer timeframe is a plausible distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The scheme uses funds from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. This highlights the importance of understanding the funding mechanism, which leverages pre-existing resources rather than creating entirely new funding streams.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  PM-JUGA's 25 interventions are implemented by 17 line ministries, not solely the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. This demonstrates the multi-ministry collaborative approach, testing the candidate's understanding of the scheme's implementation structure.  Attributing implementation to a single ministry is a common misleading tactic.


**4. With reference to the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education, consider the following statements:**

1. RPL is a formal mechanism to evaluate knowledge and skills gained through informal learning, excluding formal learning experiences.
2. The primary purpose of RPL is to certify prior learning without integrating it into the formal education system.
3.  The UGC's draft guidelines on RPL aim to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education by 5% within the next 5 years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RPL evaluates knowledge and skills gained through formal, non-formal, *and* informal learning.  The exclusion of formal learning is a deliberate attempt to mislead.  Understanding the comprehensive nature of RPL is crucial.

Statement 2 is incorrect. RPL's purpose is to integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal education system through assessments and certifications. This statement tests the candidate's understanding of the core function of RPL.  Presenting a limited, non-integrative view is a common distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While RPL aims to improve access to higher education, there is no specific target of a 5% increase in GER within 5 years mentioned in the provided context.  This tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between the general goals of RPL and specific, unsubstantiated claims.  Adding a quantifiable target is a common technique to create a plausible but false statement.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2008, not 2006, and has 164 signatories, not 174, including India. This tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the convention's timeline and the number of participating countries.  Slight alterations in dates and numbers are effective distractors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Biwako Millennium Framework is related to disability inclusion in the Asia-Pacific region, but it's not solely focused on children with disabilities and it’s not a supplementary document to the UN-CRPD.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the framework's scope and its relationship to the UN-CRPD.  Restricting the framework's scope is a deliberate misleading technique.

Statement 3 is correct. The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties to UN-CRPD did indeed have the theme mentioned.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of recent developments related to the convention.  This is a straightforward statement to provide a balance in the question's difficulty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PM-JUGA's core objective is to address critical deficiencies in social infrastructure, healthcare, education, and livelihood opportunities within tribal communities by effectively coordinating and expanding the reach of pre-existing government schemes. This approach leverages synergies and avoids duplication of efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Abhiyan's funding is drawn from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It does not involve the allocation of entirely new funds but rather utilizes existing resources more strategically.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While PM-JUGA's progress is certainly monitored, it utilizes the PM Gati Shakti Portal, a pre-existing government platform, for mapping and monitoring the tribal villages covered under the Abhiyan. It does not rely on a newly created, standalone monitoring system.

1.  The initiative's primary goal is to achieve an annual household income of ₹100,000 for all rural women in India within five years.
2.  Financial assistance under the scheme includes capitalization support through Revolving Funds (RF) and Community Investment Funds (CIF), but excludes bank loans.
3.  A "Lakhpati Didi" is defined as a Self-Help Group (SHG) member whose household earns a minimum annual income of ₹1 lakh for at least two agricultural seasons or business cycles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lakhpati Didi initiative aims to enable three crore Lakhpati Didis, but this doesn't represent all rural women in India, nor does it have a specified five-year timeframe for achieving this goal.  The target is a significant number, but not a universal goal for all rural women.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The initiative provides comprehensive financial aid, encompassing capitalization support (RF and CIF), collateral-free bank loans (up to ₹20 lakh for SHGs), interest subvention, overdraft facilities, and the Women Enterprise Acceleration Fund. It is not limited to just capitalization support.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The definition of a "Lakhpati Didi" requires an annual household income of at least ₹1 lakh for at least *four* agricultural seasons or business cycles, not just two.  This emphasizes the sustainability and consistency of the income generation.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FWI Report comprehensively tracks food waste across various stages, including retail and consumer (household and food service) levels, in addition to production level data.  Its scope is not limited to just the production stage.

Statement 2 is correct. The report directly supports the achievement of SDG 12.3.1 (b), which focuses on halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels.  The UNEP is the custodian of the FWI, aligning directly with this SDG indicator.  (Note:  The question incorrectly linked it to SDG 12.3.1(a), which concerns food loss index and FAO.)

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report estimates that food waste generates approximately 8–10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, not the higher figure mentioned in the statement.  While a significant contributor, it doesn't reach the 15-20% level.


**4. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amended rules *allow* surrogacy with donor gametes if the District Medical Board certifies a medical necessity for the couple. This represents a significant change from previous regulations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While single women (widows or divorcees) are allowed surrogacy, the amended rules specify that they must use their own eggs and donor sperm. They cannot use donor eggs.

Statement 3 is correct. The amended rules stipulate that a child born through surrogacy must have at least one gamete (either egg or sperm) originating from the commissioning couple. This condition is a key aspect of the amended regulations.


**5. With reference to the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment, consider the following statements:**

3. The initiative is exclusively focused on improving maternal and child health indicators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NQAS assessment is conducted for *public* health facilities, specifically Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL). It is not limited to private facilities.

Statement 2 is correct. The NQAS assessment is indeed based on the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS), a digital platform that enables real-time monitoring of the assessment and compliance status of public health facilities.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While improving overall public health is a goal, the NQAS assessment is not exclusively focused on maternal and child health. It aims to improve various aspects of healthcare delivery within the public health system.


**6. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The report indicates that at the current rate of progress, it will take over 200 years to close the global gender gap completely.
2. India's ranking improved significantly in 2024 compared to its ranking in 2023.
3. The report's findings are based on a comprehensive index that measures gender parity across four key dimensions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report estimates that it will take 134 years to achieve full gender parity, not over 200 years.  This is still a considerable time frame, but less than what is stated in the option.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's ranking slightly declined in 2024 (129th) compared to 2023 (127th).  The statement incorrectly suggests an improvement.

Statement 3 is correct. The Global Gender Gap Report utilizes the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), which assesses gender parity across four key dimensions: health and survival, educational attainment, economic participation and opportunity, and political empowerment.  This multi-dimensional approach provides a comprehensive overview.


**7. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA grants habitat rights only to primitive tribal groups (PVTGs) residing in reserved forests.
2. The process of granting habitat rights under the FRA involves mandatory consultations with all relevant stakeholders.
3.  The definition of 'habitat' under the FRA includes only customary habitats of the concerned tribal groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FRA primarily focuses on PVTGs, it also extends habitat rights to other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes, and it is not limited to reserved forests; it includes both reserved and protected forests.

Statement 2 is correct.  The FRA mandates a series of consultations with stakeholders before granting habitat rights.  This participatory approach is crucial to ensuring the rights are granted fairly and transparently.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FRA's definition of 'habitat' is broader than just customary habitats.  It encompasses the customary habitat and *other* habitats within reserved and protected forests for primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.  This includes areas they may have historically utilized, even if not strictly customary.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA focuses on addressing critical gaps in various sectors for tribal communities by leveraging and converging existing schemes.  It aims for comprehensive development by integrating various governmental programs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The scheme utilizes funding from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It doesn't involve the creation of a separate, entirely new funding stream.

Statement 3 is correct. The scheme's name, inspired by Birsa Munda ("Dharti Aaba"), reflects its intent to honor a significant figure in tribal history and build upon his legacy of advocating for tribal rights and welfare.  The choice of name signifies a historical and cultural context for the initiative.  The scheme draws inspiration from the success of PM-JANMAN, a similar initiative, demonstrating a continuation of government strategies aimed at empowering tribal communities.


**2. With reference to the National Medical Register (NMR) Portal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMR is mandated under Section 31 of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, and aims to create a comprehensive database of all registered Ayurvedic practitioners in India.
2.  The NMR is linked with the Aadhaar ID of doctors to ensure authenticity and facilitates interlinking of State Medical Councils (SMCs) for registration verification.
3. The NMR's establishment replaces the role of State Medical Councils entirely, centralizing all medical registration processes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NMR is mandated under Section 31 of the NMC Act, 2019, it focuses on allopathic (MBBS) registered doctors, not Ayurvedic practitioners.  The scope of the register is limited to a specific category of medical professionals.

Statement 2 is correct.  Linking the NMR with Aadhaar IDs enhances the authenticity of doctor registrations.  The interlinking of SMCs streamlines verification processes, improving efficiency and accuracy in maintaining the medical register. This integration reflects a move towards a more digitally connected and streamlined healthcare system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMR aids in interlinking SMCs but doesn't replace their role.  State Medical Councils retain their individual functions and responsibilities, working in coordination with the central NMR database.  The system maintains a balance between centralized data management and decentralized regulatory functions.

2. The use of donor gametes (egg or sperm) is strictly prohibited under the amended rules to maintain genetic ties to the intending parents.
3. The amended rules allow surrogacy with a donor gamete, provided the District Medical Board certifies the medical necessity and at least one gamete is from the intending couple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The amended rules expand access to surrogacy to include single women (widows or divorcees) under specific conditions, such as using their own eggs and donor sperm.  This demonstrates a shift towards a more inclusive approach to surrogacy regulations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The amended rules explicitly allow the use of donor gametes under specific circumstances, provided a District Medical Board certifies the medical necessity and at least one gamete originates from the intending couple.

Statement 3 is correct. The amendment allows surrogacy with donor gametes, subject to medical board approval and the condition that at least one gamete belongs to the intending parents.  This reflects a nuanced approach balancing ethical considerations with the medical needs of intending parents. The amendment clarifies the previously ambiguous position on donor gametes.


**4. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1. The criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural existence, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy.
2. Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and union territories, with a total of 13.

Statement 1 is correct. The listed criteria accurately reflect the factors considered when identifying PVTGs.  These criteria highlight the unique vulnerabilities and challenges faced by these groups, necessitating specific protective measures and developmental interventions.

Statement 2 is correct. Odisha does indeed have the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and union territories. This reflects the diverse range of tribal communities and their unique circumstances within the state.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The correct section for habitat rights under the FRA is Section 3(1)(e), not 3(1)(f).  This small detail highlights the importance of precise knowledge of legal provisions related to tribal rights.  While the overall context is accurate, the specific legal reference needs correction.  The question tests attention to detail on legal terminology.


**5. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed in 1950.
2.  The Idate Commission (2017) recommended the immediate repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act in all states to prevent harassment of DNT members.
3. August 30th is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNTs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was repealed in 1952, not 1950.  This seemingly minor difference in dates is a significant point of factual accuracy for UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Idate Commission did recommend the repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act to prevent its misuse against DNT communities.  This reflects the ongoing efforts to address historical injustices and systemic discrimination faced by marginalized groups.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  August 31st, not August 30th, is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day. Again, this demonstrates the importance of precise factual recall in answering such questions. The date is a crucial piece of information.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PM-JUGA's core objective is to address critical gaps in various sectors by integrating existing schemes.  The program aims for comprehensive development of tribal communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The funding for PM-JUGA is derived from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  It does not involve the allocation of new, dedicated funds.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PM-JUGA is based on the learnings and success of the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN), not PMJVK.  PM-JANMAN's success in focused tribal development informed the design and implementation of PM-JUGA.  The programs are distinct, although related in their focus on tribal welfare.

(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2024 was released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the World Food Programme. While the World Food Programme is crucial in global hunger initiatives, it was not a partner in releasing this specific report.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's ranking improved slightly (from 111th to 105th), the report still categorized India's hunger situation as "serious."  The improvement was marginal and does not signify substantial progress.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI 2024 explicitly highlights the strong link between gender inequality and hunger, indicating that women and girls disproportionately bear the burden of food insecurity and malnutrition.


**3. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines ‘habitat’ exclusively as the customary habitat of primitive tribal groups within reserved forests.
2.  The grant of habitat rights under the FRA requires mandatory prior consultation with only the affected tribal community.
3. The Dongria Kondhs of Odisha are among the tribal groups recognized as having habitat rights under the FRA.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FRA's definition of 'habitat' is broader, encompassing customary habitats and other habitats in reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.  It's not limited solely to customary habitats within reserved forests.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The FRA mandates a sequence of consultations with all stakeholders involved in the process of granting habitat rights, not just the affected tribal community. This ensures a more inclusive and participatory approach.

Statement 3 is correct. The Dongria Kondhs of Odisha are explicitly mentioned in the provided text as one of the tribal groups having habitat rights under the FRA.

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FWI Report 2024 is a joint initiative of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme), not the FAO.  The FAO is involved in other food-related SDG indicators, but not the FWI specifically.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FWI tracks food waste at both retail and consumer (household and food service) levels, not just the consumer level.  The scope encompasses the entire supply chain from retail to consumption.

Statement 3 is correct. The FWI directly supports the achievement of SDG 12.3.1 (b), which focuses on halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels.  The report's data and analysis are directly relevant to this specific goal.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report, 'The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains: An Opportunity for Gender Impact,' was launched by GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition), not the World Food Programme (WFP).  While both organizations work on nutrition-related issues, the report's authorship is attributed to GAIN.

Statement 2 is correct. The report explicitly highlights the crucial role of gender equality in improving nutrition outcomes.  It argues that addressing gender inequalities in the agri-food sector is essential for improving nutrition and overall development.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the report addresses agricultural productivity, it has a broader scope. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of nutritious food value chains, gender equality, business resilience, and the overall impact on nutrition. It is not solely focused on agricultural productivity in isolation.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GNAFC was launched in 2016, not 2017, by a collaborative effort involving the European Union, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Food Programme (WFP), not solely by the United Nations.  It's a multi-stakeholder initiative.

Statement 2 is correct. A primary objective of the GNAFC is to enhance humanitarian responses to food crises. It seeks to improve coordination and effectiveness in addressing the root causes of these crises.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GNAFC's annual Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), not the World Food Programme (WFP).  While the WFP is involved in the GNAFC, the report's authorship is attributed to FSIN.


**9. With reference to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The report was released by the World Health Organization (WHO) alone.
2. The report indicates that the world is on track to achieve SDG 2, Zero Hunger, by 2030.
3. The report provides a new definition of financing for food security and nutrition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, was jointly released by five UN agencies: FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO. It was not the work of a single organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report explicitly states that the world is far from achieving SDG 2, Zero Hunger, by 2030.  The progress made is insufficient to meet the target.

Statement 3 is correct. A key feature of the 2024 report is its introduction of a new, comprehensive definition of financing for food security and nutrition, encompassing public and private resources, domestic and foreign, directed towards eradicating hunger and malnutrition.  This definition is a significant contribution.


**10. Consider the following statements about Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1. The criteria for identifying PVTGs include a predominantly agricultural-based economy.
2. Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all Indian states and Union Territories.
3.  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is a state-sponsored program with partial central funding.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  One of the criteria for identifying PVTGs is a pre-agricultural or subsistence economy, not a predominantly agricultural-based economy.  The focus is on groups with a low level of economic development and dependence on forest resources.

Statement 2 is correct. Odisha is explicitly mentioned as having the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all Indian states and Union Territories.  This highlights the specific challenges faced by tribal populations in Odisha.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central assistance, not a state-sponsored program with partial central funding.  The funding comes entirely from the central government.



**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dhebar Committee, established in 1960-61, recommended the recognition of 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory, with Odisha having the highest number.
2.  Criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, a pre-agricultural level of existence, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy.  
3. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central assistance, aims to comprehensively develop PVTGs socio-economically while preserving their culture and heritage, focusing on education, housing, and infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect information regarding PVTGs.  The Dhebar Committee's recommendations and the subsequent recognition of 75 PVTGs, with Odisha leading in numbers, are factual. The listed criteria for PVTG identification are also accurate, representing the characteristics used to designate these groups. Finally, the description of the 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, including its funding mechanism and objectives, aligns with the scheme's design and goals. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incomplete representations of the facts.


**2. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines 'habitat' as encompassing customary habitats and other habitats within reserved and protected forests used by primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.
2.  Habitat rights under the FRA are granted solely based on self-declaration by the tribal community, without any external verification or consultation.
3. The FRA mandates the immediate eviction of all tribal groups from forest lands irrespective of their historical presence or customary rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 correctly reflects the FRA's definition of "habitat".  Statement 2 is incorrect; the FRA involves a sequence of consultations with stakeholders before habitat rights are granted.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the FRA aims to recognize and secure the forest rights of forest-dwelling tribal communities and other traditional forest dwellers, not to evict them.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately represents the provisions of the FRA.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by focusing solely on providing financial assistance to individual households.
2.  The scheme is named after a historical figure who led a rebellion against the British Raj, and it emphasizes the convergence of various schemes for comprehensive development.
3. PM-JUGA's funding exclusively comes from newly allocated funds specifically designated for this scheme, independent of existing development programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate. PM-JUGA is indeed named after Birsa Munda and aims for comprehensive development through the convergence of existing schemes. Statement 1 is incorrect because PM-JUGA's approach is broader than just individual household financial aid; it addresses infrastructure and other community needs. Statement 3 is also incorrect; PM-JUGA utilizes existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants. Thus, only statement 2 correctly describes the key aspects of the PM-JUGA scheme.


**4. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following statements:**

1.  NIRF was launched in 2010 and ranks educational institutions based solely on their research output.
2. The NBA, in collaboration with INFLIBNET, implements NIRF, assessing the qualitative competence of programs across various disciplines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The GHI 2024 did highlight the link between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the report indicated alarming hunger levels in many countries, making the 2030 goal unattainable. Statement 2 is also incorrect; India's ranking and score in 2024 placed it in the "serious" category, not "low".  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the findings of the GHI 2024 report.


**6. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1. All nomadic tribes are DNTs, and all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Supreme Court struck down provisions in prison manuals that discriminated against DNTs, deeming them unconstitutional.
3.  DNTs were designated as "criminal tribes" during the British Raj under the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Supreme Court did strike down discriminatory provisions against DNTs in prison manuals, and the British Raj's Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 is the origin of the DNT categorization. However, statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs, although all DNTs are historically nomadic or semi-nomadic groups.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect facts about DNTs.


**7. With reference to the  Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 was released by the World Health Organization (WHO) and tracks food waste at the production level.
2.  The report focuses on food waste generation at retail and consumer levels (household and food service).
3. The report highlights that food waste is not a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Food Waste Index Report 2024, released by UNEP and WRAP, indeed tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels. Statement 1 is incorrect because the WHO was not involved in releasing this report, and it focuses on waste at later stages, not production. Statement 3 is also incorrect; food waste is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the focus of the Food Waste Index Report 2024.

1. The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, with India as a signatory.
2. The 17th session of the Conference of States Parties to the UN-CRPD focused on the theme of "Promoting tourism for persons with disabilities."
3. The UN-CRPD aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The UN-CRPD's adoption date, entry into force, and India's signatory status are accurate. The convention's objective to promote full and equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities is also accurate. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the theme of the 17th session was "Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future."  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately describe the UN-CRPD.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. ANRF's goal to foster research and innovation and make India a knowledge-driven society is accurate. Statement 1 is incorrect; ANRF was established under the ANRF Act of 2023, and it subsumed SERB, not DST. Statement 3 is also incorrect; ANRF's funding involves both government and private sector contributions.  Thus, only statement 2 accurately reflects ANRF's objectives and structure.


**10. With reference to Foreign University Campuses in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, were enacted to restrict the entry of foreign universities into India.
2.  The University of Southampton was the first foreign university to establish a campus in India under the 2023 regulations.
3.  Foreign universities seeking to set up campuses in India must be ranked in the global top 500.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only

(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The University of Southampton's establishment in India under the 2023 regulations, and the top 500 global ranking criterion for applicant universities, are both accurate. Statement 1 is incorrect; the 2023 regulations aim to *facilitate*, not restrict, the entry of high-ranking foreign universities. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the information regarding foreign university campuses in India.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dhebar Committee, established in 1960-61, recommended the recognition of 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory.  Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs.
2.  Criteria for identifying PVTGs include forest-based livelihoods, a pre-agricultural level of existence, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy rates, and a subsistence economy.  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' scheme aims for their comprehensive socio-economic development while preserving their culture.
3. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central assistance, primarily focusing on education, housing, and agricultural development.  It utilizes a micro-plan approach through Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect information regarding PVTGs. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Dhebar Committee's role in recommending PVTG recognition and Odisha's leading position in the number of recognized groups. Statement 2 accurately lists the criteria used to identify PVTGs and the overarching goal of the development scheme. Statement 3 correctly describes the funding mechanism of the scheme and its focus areas, including the use of CCD plans.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.


**2. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Food Waste Index (FWI) tracks global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels (household and food service).  It contributes to SDG 12.3.1 (b), aiming to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030.
2.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024, launched by UNEP and WRAP, found that households across all continents wasted over 1 billion meals daily in 2022. Food waste contributes to 12-15% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
3. The custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), which tracks food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses, is the World Food Programme (WFP).  The FWI and FLI are both crucial indicators under SDG 12.3.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the FWI does track food waste at the specified levels and contributes to SDG 12.3.1 (b).  Statement 2 is partially correct in that the FWI did report the high level of household food waste. However, the estimate of greenhouse gas emissions from food waste is inaccurate; a more accurate figure is closer to 8-10%. Statement 3 is incorrect; the custodian of the FLI is the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not the WFP.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are partially correct, making (c) the closest option, although  statement 2 contains a minor inaccuracy.



**3. With reference to the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment and Spot Food License initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched the virtual NQAS Assessment for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs), complying with Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS).  The IPHS is a digital platform for real-time monitoring of public health facilities.
2. The Spot Food License initiative aims for instant license and registration issuance via the Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS) pan-India IT platform.  It simplifies licensing procedures and promotes "Healthcare for All."
3.  Both the NQAS Assessment and the Spot Food License initiative are aimed at improving sanitation and nutrition standards across India.  They are directly linked to achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the NQAS Assessment and Spot Food License initiative, respectively.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While both initiatives contribute to improved public health, their primary focus is not directly on sanitation and nutrition standards, nor are they directly linked to achieving SDGs 2 and 6 in the manner described. The NQAS focuses on healthcare facility quality, and the Spot Food License initiative focuses on streamlining food business licensing.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.


**4.  With reference to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), consider the following statements:**

1. GAIN, a Swiss-based NGO, launched a report titled ‘The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains’ to promote nutrition investments in the agri-food sector. This report highlights how such investments can reduce gender inequalities and enhance business resilience, but not necessarily increase productivity.
2. GAIN was launched in 2002 at the United Nations to address malnutrition and supports public-private partnerships to increase access to essential nutrients.  GAIN has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, and also maintains an office in India.
3.  GAIN's primary focus is on providing direct food aid to malnourished populations globally.  It works in close collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP) to distribute food supplies and nutritional supplements.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, though it slightly misrepresents the report's findings by suggesting that increased productivity is *not* a benefit. The report actually does highlight increased productivity as a positive outcome of such investments. Statement 2 accurately describes GAIN's establishment, mission, and locations. Statement 3 is incorrect; GAIN's approach is not primarily focused on direct food aid distribution but rather on strengthening food systems and increasing access to nutritious foods through public-private partnerships.  It does *not* primarily work with the WFP in direct food distribution. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are substantially correct, although statement 1 contains a minor inaccuracy.


**5. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The FRA defines 'habitat' as the area comprising the customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.  Habitat rights are granted after consultation with stakeholders.
2.  The FRA provides habitat rights to all forest-dwelling communities irrespective of their traditional connection to the forest.  The process of granting these rights is streamlined and does not require extensive consultations.
3.  Several states in India, including Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra, have granted habitat rights to various tribal communities under the FRA.  These rights include the right to protect, regenerate, or conserve or manage any community forest resource which they have been traditionally protecting and conserving for sustainable use.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the FRA's definition of 'habitat' and the process involved in granting habitat rights. Statement 2 is incorrect; the FRA does *not* provide habitat rights to all forest-dwelling communities indiscriminately. It requires a demonstrable traditional connection to the forest.  Statement 3 is correct; the mentioned states have indeed granted habitat rights to various tribal communities under the FRA. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**6. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and Nomadic Tribes, consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.  DNTs are communities that were labeled as 'born criminals' during the British Raj under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871.
2.  The Supreme Court's ruling in *Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others* highlighted caste-based discrimination in prisons, particularly affecting DNTs and 'habitual offenders'.  The court struck down provisions assigning jobs in prisons based on caste.
3.  Nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes can be categorized into hunter-gatherers, pastoral communities, and peripatetic groups.  These groups often face significant socio-economic challenges due to their mobile lifestyles and lack of access to formal services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the relationship between nomadic tribes and DNTs is the reverse – all DNTs are considered nomadic or semi-nomadic, but not all nomadic groups are DNTs. Statement 2 accurately summarizes the *Sukanya Santha* case and the Supreme Court's decision. Statement 3 correctly categorizes nomadic communities and highlights their socio-economic challenges.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.



**7. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, indicates that hunger levels in 42 countries are alarming, jeopardizing the 'Zero Hunger' goal by 2030. The world's GHI score is 18.3, considered moderate.
2.  India's GHI score in 2024 improved to 105th out of 127 countries (from 111th in 2023), falling under the "serious" category.  Approximately 13.7% of India's population suffers from undernourishment.
3.  The GHI report highlights the link between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.  It emphasizes that women and girls are disproportionately affected by food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly due to weather extremes and climate emergencies.  Initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) aim to address food insecurity in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly reflect information presented in the GHI 2024 report. Statement 1 accurately describes the global hunger situation and the world's GHI score. Statement 2 correctly reflects India's ranking and the prevalence of undernourishment. Statement 3 correctly highlights the report's emphasis on the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, and it correctly mentions the PMGKAY as a relevant Indian initiative.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements.


**8.  With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

1. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods through convergence of different schemes.  It is based on the learnings of PM-JANMAN.
2. PM-JUGA includes initiatives such as Tribal Home Stays to promote tourism, sustainable livelihoods for Forest Rights Act (FRA) holders, improving infrastructure in government residential schools and hostels, advanced facilities for Sickle Cell Disease diagnosis, and Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs).
3.  PM-JUGA is entirely funded through a new dedicated central fund, independent of existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants. The scheme is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known as Dharti Aaba.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the objectives and key initiatives of PM-JUGA.  Statement 3 is incorrect; PM-JUGA utilizes funding from existing DAPST grants, not a completely new, independent fund, though it does aim for convergence of various schemes. While it is named after Birsa Munda, this fact alone doesn't render the other elements of statement 3 correct.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**9. With reference to the Lakhpati Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lakhpati Didi initiative, launched in 2023, aims to enable three crore Lakhpati Didis (women with annual household incomes of ₹1 lakh or more). It is an outcome of the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM).
2.  A Lakhpati Didi is defined as a Self-Help Group (SHG) member who earns an annual household income of at least ₹1 lakh calculated over four agricultural seasons or business cycles, with an average monthly income exceeding ₹10,000. SHGs are self-governed groups of up to 20 members.
3. The initiative provides financial assistance through capitalization support (Revolving Fund and Community Investment Fund), collateral-free bank loans up to ₹20 lakh for SHGs, interest subvention, and overdraft facilities. It also includes the Women Enterprise Acceleration Fund and the Vulnerability Reduction Fund (VRF).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe aspects of the Lakhpati Didi initiative. Statement 1 correctly identifies the initiative's goal, launch year, and connection to DAY-NRLM. Statement 2 accurately defines a Lakhpati Didi and describes SHGs. Statement 3 correctly outlines the various forms of financial assistance provided under the initiative. There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements.


**1. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NIRF framework was launched in 2010 by the Ministry of Human Resource Development.
2.  The 2024 NIRF rankings introduced new categories for ranking Open Universities and Private Universities.
3.  The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) is the sole implementing agency for NIRF rankings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NIRF was launched in 2015, not 2010, by the Ministry of Education (formerly Ministry of Human Resource Development).  The initial aim was to objectively rank higher educational institutions across India based on a defined methodology.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 NIRF rankings did indeed introduce new categories, including Open Universities and State Public Universities, reflecting an expansion of the framework's scope and its attempt to encompass a broader range of Indian higher education institutions.  This demonstrates a commitment to a more inclusive ranking system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NBA plays a significant role in the NIRF process, it does not act as the sole implementing agency.  The INFLIBNET Centre in Gandhinagar collaborates with the NBA in implementing the NIRF framework. This collaborative approach ensures a more comprehensive and robust evaluation process.  The involvement of INFLIBNET highlights the importance of technological and data management expertise in the ranking process.


**2. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The report, published by the World Bank, uses the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) to measure gender parity across four key dimensions.
2.  Iceland ranked highest in the 2024 report, showing near-complete gender parity.
3.  India's rank improved significantly in the 2024 report compared to the previous year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 was released by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the World Bank. The report does indeed utilize the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) to benchmark gender parity across four dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment.  The use of a standardized index allows for meaningful comparisons across countries.

Statement 2 is correct. Iceland did indeed secure the top position in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Report, reflecting a high level of gender parity achieved across various indicators. This highlights Iceland's progressive policies and commitment to gender equality.  The ranking serves as a benchmark for other nations striving for gender parity.
