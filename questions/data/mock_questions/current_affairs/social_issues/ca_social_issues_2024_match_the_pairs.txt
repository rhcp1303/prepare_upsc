**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry                                     Scheme
1. Ministry of Heavy Industries             :   Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme (PM-KISAN)
2. Ministry of Jal Shakti                   :   Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM): Har Ghar Jal
3. Ministry of Rural Development           :   Atal Bhujal Yojana (ATAL JAL)
4. Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment :   National Action Plan for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme (PM-KISAN) falls under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, not the Ministry of Heavy Industries.  Option 1 is therefore incorrect. The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) is indeed a flagship program of the Ministry of Jal Shakti, aiming to provide safe and adequate drinking water to every rural household. This makes option 2 correct. The Atal Bhujal Yojana (ATAL JAL) is a centrally sponsored scheme implemented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti, not the Ministry of Rural Development. Option 3 is thus incorrect. The National Action Plan for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) is a scheme under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, focusing on mechanized sanitation solutions. This makes option 4 correct. Therefore, only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Ministry
1.  PM Street Vendor’s Atma Nirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) Scheme : Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
2.  National Health Mission (NHM)             :   Ministry of Heavy Industries
3.  Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Automobile & Auto Components : Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PM Street Vendor’s Atma Nirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) Scheme is correctly paired with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  The National Health Mission (NHM) falls under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Heavy Industries. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Automobile & Auto Components is a scheme under the Ministry of Heavy Industries, not the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. The Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) is implemented by the Ministry of Heavy Industries, not the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, only option 1 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to Government Schemes, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                           Implementing Agency
1.  Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation – AMRUT 2.0 : NABARD
2.  Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK)      :   Ministry of Minority Affairs
3.  National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP)       :   Ministry of Rural Development
4.  Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)  :   Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation – AMRUT 2.0 is not implemented by NABARD.  NABARD is primarily involved in agricultural credit and rural development. Option 1 is incorrect. Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) is correctly linked to the Ministry of Minority Affairs. Option 2 is correct. The National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development. Option 3 is correct. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) accurately corresponds to the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying. Option 4 is correct.  Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Key Feature
1.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :  Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all
2.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy
3.  Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 : Regulates ART clinics and banks
4.  Hindu Marriage Act, 1955                   :   Upholds prohibition of marriage between Sapindas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The MTP Act allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women, with certain exceptions extending to 24 weeks under specific conditions.  Option 1 is therefore incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, correctly prohibits commercial surrogacy and permits only altruistic surrogacy. Option 2 is correct.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, accurately aims to regulate and supervise ART clinics and banks. Option 3 is correct. The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, does indeed prohibit marriages between Sapindas. Option 4 is correct. Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to Educational Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                  Key Feature
1.  Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) :  Focuses solely on primary school children
2.  All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) :  Provides individual student scores
3.  National Achievement Survey (NAS)        :   Assesses learning achievement across multiple classes
4.  Holistic Progress Card (HPC)              :   Emphasizes a 360-degree assessment of student progress


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

ASER includes both primary and beyond primary age group students in its surveys.  Option 1 is incorrect. AISHE does not provide individual student scores; it provides system-level data on higher education. Option 2 is incorrect.  The National Achievement Survey (NAS) correctly assesses the learning achievement of students across Classes 3, 5, 8, and 10. Option 3 is correct.  The Holistic Progress Card (HPC) accurately aims to provide a comprehensive, multidimensional assessment of student progress. Option 4 is correct. Therefore, only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                  Key Feature
1. MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021               : Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks in specific cases
2. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 : Provides only civil remedies for marital rape
3.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013  :  Mandates Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations with 10 or more employees

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, significantly broadened the scope of legal abortion in India, extending the permissible timeframe for termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances, including rape, incest, and risk to the mother's health.  The Act also introduces a two-doctor requirement for terminations between 20 and 24 weeks.  This makes statement 1 correct.

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, while addressing various forms of domestic abuse, notably does not provide for criminal prosecution of marital rape.  It primarily offers civil remedies, such as protection orders and maintenance. This makes statement 2 correct.

The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act),  establishes a robust mechanism to address sexual harassment at the workplace. A crucial element of this Act is the mandatory establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations with 10 or more employees.  These committees are responsible for investigating complaints and recommending appropriate action.  Therefore, statement 3 is also correct.  All three statements are accurate reflections of the key features of the respective legislations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                                     Implementing Ministry/Agency
1. Boeing Sukanya Program                            : Ministry of Civil Aviation
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme      : Ministry of Labour and Employment
3.  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)   : Ministry of Women and Child Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Boeing Sukanya Program, while focused on promoting women's participation in the aviation sector, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, which is responsible for overseeing the country's aviation infrastructure and policies. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The correct ministry would be the Ministry of Women and Child Development.


The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme is a central sector scheme implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Employment.  This ministry holds the responsibility for policies and programs related to labor welfare, including the eradication of child labor. Statement 2 is correct.

The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), a scheme providing financial assistance to pregnant and lactating women, is a flagship program of the Ministry of Women and Child Development. This ministry is the primary agency responsible for the welfare of women and children in India, making statement 3 correct.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Law                                             Key Provision
1.  The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 :  Criminalizes commercial dealing in human organs
2.  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956          :  Prohibits immoral trafficking and sex work
3.  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976      :  Addresses economic and physical exploitation of weaker sections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, aims to regulate organ donation and transplantation, explicitly criminalizing the commercial aspects of organ trade. This directly addresses the ethical and legal concerns surrounding the commodification of human organs, making statement 1 correct.

The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, focuses on combating immoral trafficking and related offenses, including sex work.  The Act aims to prevent exploitation and protect vulnerable individuals from being forced into such activities.  This makes statement 2 correct.

The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, is specifically designed to eliminate the practice of bonded labor, a form of exploitation where individuals are forced to work to repay debts.  The Act seeks to protect vulnerable populations from economic and physical exploitation, making statement 3 correct.  Thus, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to initiatives for women's empowerment in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Key Objective/Feature
1.  One Stop Centres                               : Assist women affected by violence in both private and public spaces
2.  Nari Adalats                                  :  Resolve cases of petty nature faced by women at the Gram Panchayat level
3.  Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme       : Aims for zero-budget advertising and focuses on on-ground impact activities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

One Stop Centres (OSCs) are integrated support services for women affected by violence.  They provide a single point of access to various services, including medical aid, police assistance, and legal counseling, covering both private and public spaces where violence may occur.  Statement 1 is correct.

Nari Adalats are alternative dispute resolution mechanisms specifically designed to address petty issues and grievances faced by women at the Gram Panchayat level.  They offer a quicker and more accessible forum for resolving minor conflicts, fostering local-level justice. Statement 2 is correct.

The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) scheme, while aiming for social change, prioritizes on-ground impact through activities such as promoting sports and self-defense training for girls. The scheme emphasizes tangible results over extensive advertising campaigns. Statement 3 is also correct. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to child welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                      Key Provision/Feature
1. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme  :  Operates Special Schools/Rehabilitation Centres for child labourers
3.  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956 : Governs inter-country adoption of orphaned children


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a "child" as a person below 18 years of age, providing a legal framework for the care and protection of children in conflict with the law or in need of care and protection.  Statement 1 is correct.

The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme establishes special schools and rehabilitation centers to aid in the rehabilitation and reintegration of children rescued from exploitative labor situations.  This reflects a commitment to providing education and alternative opportunities for child laborers.  Statement 2 is correct.

The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956, primarily deals with adoption within the Hindu community, not inter-country adoptions. Inter-country adoptions are governed by different regulations and processes under the Juvenile Justice Act and associated rules. Therefore, statement 3 is incorrect.  Only statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                     State/UT
1. Great Andamanese                 :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
2. Jarawas                          :   Mizoram
3. Shompens                         :   Arunachal Pradesh
4. Baiga                             :   Himachal Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Great Andamanese tribe is indeed located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the geographical location of the Jarawas and Shompens tribes. The Jarawas primarily inhabit the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, specifically South and Middle Andaman. The Shompens reside on Great Nicobar Island, also part of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago.  The Baiga tribe is found in states like Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, not Himachal Pradesh. This question tests factual recall regarding the geographical distribution of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India.  Understanding the geographical spread of these groups is crucial for comprehending the challenges they face in terms of access to resources, healthcare, and education.  The incorrect options highlight the importance of precise knowledge, as even slight inaccuracies in location can lead to flawed understanding of socio-economic realities.


**2. With reference to PVTGs, consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs          Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology    :   Use of sophisticated tools and techniques
2. Low level of literacy                  :   Literacy rate above 90%
3. Economic backwardness               :   High per capita income
4. Declining or stagnant population     :   Rapid population growth

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are the opposite of what is described in each pair.  PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural technology (meaning a lack of sophisticated tools), low literacy rates, economic backwardness (low per capita income), and a declining or stagnant population, not the opposite. This question tests the understanding of the defining characteristics of PVTGs, which is crucial for evaluating government policies aimed at their welfare.  The inclusion of seemingly plausible but incorrect descriptions in the options serves as a strong distractor, highlighting the need for accurate knowledge of the concept. The incorrect options point towards a common misconception that PVTGs might possess characteristics that are not actually true.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                     Characteristic
1. Bharia                            :  Largest tribal group in India
2. Koya                             :  Resides primarily in Himachal Pradesh
3. Asur                             :  Language not listed by UNESCO


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the statement about the Bharia tribe being a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh is correct. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh. The Koya tribe is not primarily located in Himachal Pradesh; they are found in states like Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh. The Asur language is indeed listed in UNESCO's Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger.  This question tests knowledge about specific tribal groups in India, their characteristics, and their vulnerability. The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, emphasizing the importance of precise information. The inaccurate information in the distractor options underscores how easily misconceptions can arise concerning the details about specific tribal groups.


**4. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Fact                                 Detail
1. Highest population of STs (absolute numbers) :   Odisha
2. Nodal Ministry for Tribal Affairs       :   Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
3. World Tribal Day                       :   Observed on September 9th


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of STs in absolute numbers, not Odisha. The nodal ministry for tribal affairs is the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, not the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples (also known as World Tribal Day) is observed on August 9th, not September 9th. This question tests factual knowledge about the status of Scheduled Tribes in India, including administrative structures and significant dates. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect details in the options highlights the need for precise information and understanding of official designations.  The incorrect options serve as strong distractors, emphasizing the need to accurately recall key facts related to tribal welfare in India.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                             Ministry
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme : Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)        : Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of NAMASTE scheme with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is correct. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. This question assesses the knowledge of government schemes and their respective ministries. The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the ability to differentiate between ministries responsible for social welfare programs.  The distractors highlight common misconceptions that can arise from a superficial understanding of government organizational structures.


**6. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                 Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs          :  Not less than 2%
2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions : Not less than 10%
3. Recognized types of disabilities         :  15


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the provision regarding the number of recognized disabilities is correctly matched. The Act mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs and not less than 5% reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions. The act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 15. This question tests the understanding of the key provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.  The incorrect options act as strong distractors, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the legal framework concerning disability rights in India.  The incorrect options showcase the importance of detailed knowledge of the act, as even slight inaccuracies in percentages or numbers can significantly alter the understanding.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                               Report/Index
1. UNFPA                                   :   Global Hunger Index
2. IFPRI                                    :   State of World Population Report
3. World Economic Forum                    :   Global Gender Gap Index


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair linking the World Economic Forum to the Global Gender Gap Index is correct. The UNFPA publishes the State of World Population Report, not the Global Hunger Index. The IFPRI releases the Global Food Policy Report, not the State of World Population Report.  This question evaluates the understanding of various international organizations and their publications.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, testing the ability to distinguish between organizations and their areas of expertise. The incorrect options emphasize the need for precise knowledge regarding the work of the organizations mentioned, as even a slight mismatching leads to an incorrect answer.


**8. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                   Detail
1.  Schooling Structure                    :   4+3+3+4
2.  Board Examinations                     :   Allowed only once a year
3.  Languages                             :   Proficiency in at least two Indian languages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the statement regarding language proficiency is correctly matched.  The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 schooling structure, not 4+3+3+4. Board examinations are allowed at least twice a year, not just once. The framework emphasizes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages. This question tests the understanding of the key features of the NCF-SE. The incorrect options serve as significant distractors, highlighting the need for a thorough understanding of the curriculum framework's details.  The inaccurate information in the distractor options points to the importance of carefully studying the NCF-SE document to avoid making basic factual errors.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Feature
1.  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020      :   GER target of 30% by 2035
2.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023 :  Repealed the National Medical Commission Act
3.  National Credit Framework (NCrF)          :   Focuses exclusively on higher education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023 with its key feature is correct. NEP 2020 targets a GER of at least 50% by 2035, not 30%. The NRF Act repealed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008, not the National Medical Commission Act.  The NCrF integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education, not focusing exclusively on higher education.  This question assesses the understanding of key education policies and acts in India. The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, testing the ability to differentiate between the specific features of each policy.  The distractors highlight the need for precise knowledge of the content of each act and policy to avoid making mistakes due to conflation of information.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/Region
1.  Koya                                       Odisha
2.  Asur                                       Andaman and Nicobar Islands
3.  Bhils                                      Madhya Pradesh
4.  Baiga                                      Chhattisgarh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Koya tribe primarily resides in Malkangiri district of Odisha, and also in Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Option 1 is partially correct as they are present in Odisha but not exclusively. The Asur tribe is found in Jharkhand, not the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Option 2 is incorrect. Bhils are the largest tribal group in India, residing mainly in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh. Option 3 is correct. The Baiga tribe is listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making option 4 correct.  The question tests factual recall of tribal geographical distribution.  Options 1 and 2 are designed as plausible distractors, leveraging knowledge of tribal groups but mismatching their locations.  The correct answer focuses on the accurate state/regional association of the Bhils and Baiga tribes, emphasizing precise geographical knowledge crucial for UPSC preparation.

(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs were first recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), not in 2006. Option 1 is incorrect. Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India; the total number of PVTGs across India is 75. Option 2 is incorrect.  One of the criteria for identifying PVTGs is indeed a pre-agricultural level of technology. Option 3 is correct.  PVTGs were renamed from PTGs in 2006. Option 4 is correct. The question tests factual recall of key characteristics and features of PVTGs. Options 1 and 2 are designed as plausible distractors by using close but incorrect dates and figures.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

UNFPA's mandate is to ensure sexual and reproductive rights, not to monitor the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  That is the function of UNCRC. Option 1 is incorrect. UNHCR works to save lives, protect rights, and build a better future for refugees. Option 2 is incorrect.  The World Food Programme (WFP) provides life-saving food to people displaced by conflict and those in need. Option 3 is correct. UNCRC monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Option 4 is correct. This question tests knowledge of the mandates of various UN organizations.

(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Foundational Stage age group, as per NCF-SE, is 3-8 years, not 8-11 years. Option 1 is incorrect.  Students are allowed to take board examinations on at least two occasions during any given school year, not just once. Option 2 is incorrect. The NCF-SE promotes multilingualism, with proficiency in at least three languages, at least two of which should be native to India. Option 3 is partially correct but not entirely accurate.  The NCF-SE does propose engagement in three different forms of work: work with life forms, work with materials and machines, and work in human services. Option 4 is correct. The question assesses understanding of the NCF-SE's key elements. Options 1 and 2 serve as distractors, testing knowledge of the precise age ranges and examination policies.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. Option 1 is correct. The Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. Option 2 is incorrect. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is jointly released by the WHO and the World Bank. Option 3 is correct. The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the UNDP, not the World Economic Forum. Option 4 is incorrect. This question tests knowledge of various global indices and their releasing bodies.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are partially correct, as they are PVTGs in those states, but not exclusively.  Pair 3 is incorrect; the Sentinelese, Onges, Jarawas, and Great Andamanese are PVTGs in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, not the Baiga. The Shompens are indeed a PVTG residing in Great Nicobar Island, making pair 4 correct.  Option (c) accurately reflects this information.  Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, either by misrepresenting the state/territory associated with a PVTG or by including entirely inaccurate pairings.  The question tests factual recall of PVTG locations and requires careful analysis to identify partially correct and completely incorrect matches.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes is indeed under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is also under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly assigned ministries, demonstrating a need for precise factual recall regarding governmental responsibilities for social welfare schemes and legislation.


**3. With reference to Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                              Description
1.  PVTGs                                           :   First recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs)
2.  DNTs                                             :   Communities ‘notified’ as ‘born criminal’ during British rule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs (Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups) were indeed first recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), making pair 1 correct. Denotified Tribes (DNTs) were communities labeled as "born criminals" during the British Raj, making pair 2 correct. However, World Tribal Day is observed on August 9th, not August 31st. August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include either partially or completely inaccurate information, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of terminology and dates related to tribal welfare.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                         Detail
1.  Reservation in Government jobs                  :   Not less than 5% reservation in Government/Government aided higher educational institutions
2.  Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions   :   Not less than 4% reservation in Government jobs
3.  Free Education for children with benchmark disabilities:  Every child with benchmark disability between the age of 6 to 18 years shall have the right to free education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Act mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), not 5% as stated in pair 1.  Pair 2 incorrectly states that the 5% reservation applies to government jobs; it applies to higher educational institutions. Pair 3 correctly states the provision for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between 6 and 18 years of age. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) demonstrate the need for precise understanding of the numerical details and application of the Act's provisions.  The question tests detailed factual recall and the ability to distinguish between similar but incorrect statements.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

2.  UNHCR                                          :   India Ageing Report 2023
3.  IFPRI                                           :   Global Food Policy Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) did not release the Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report; that was the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). The UNHCR did not release the India Ageing Report 2023; that was a collaborative effort between UNFPA and the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS). The IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) correctly released the Global Food Policy Report 2023.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect pairings of organizations and their reports, emphasizing the importance of accurate association of reports with their originating organizations. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to correctly link organizations with their publications.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

1.  Saksham Anganwadis                         :   Eliminate hazardous cleaning and stop deaths of sewer and septic tank workers
2.  NAMASTE scheme                              :   Improve nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women and lactating mothers
3.  POSHAN Abhiyan                             :   Improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of Anganwadi Centers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Saksham Anganwadis focus on strengthening and upgrading Anganwadi Centers, not on eliminating hazardous cleaning practices.  The NAMASTE scheme aims to mechanize sanitation, including sewer and septic tank cleaning, to prevent worker deaths. POSHAN Abhiyan's goal is to improve the overall efficiency of Anganwadi Centers and improve nutrition for children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) include mismatched focus areas, demonstrating the need for precise understanding of the goals and objectives of different government schemes. This question tests the ability to link schemes with their specific policy objectives.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims to achieve a 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education by 2035, making pair 1 correct. The policy also targets increasing public investment in education to 6% of GDP, though it doesn't specify a year. Universal access to schooling from pre-primary to Grade 12 is a long-term goal, but the NEP doesn't assign a specific year for its complete achievement. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) show a misunderstanding of the NEP’s timeframe for achieving its goals. The question tests knowledge of policy targets and their associated timelines.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Commission                      Recommendation
1.  Idate Commission                           :  Setting up a permanent commission for De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes
2.  Renke Commission                           :   Specific debt-to-GDP ratio for central and state governments
3.  NK Singh Committee                        :  Estimated the OBC population at 52%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Idate Commission did recommend a permanent commission for DNTs, making pair 1 correct.  The Renke Commission focused on nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, not debt-to-GDP ratios; that was examined by the NK Singh Committee. The Second Backward Classes Commission (Mandal Commission, not explicitly named Renke) estimated the OBC population. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect committee-recommendation pairings, emphasizing the need for specific knowledge of various committees and their recommendations.  The question tests detailed factual recall and the ability to correctly link committees with their specific recommendations.


**9.  With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                        India's GHI Score

2.  2023                                        :   29.2
3.  2023                                        :   Ranked 111th among 125 countries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

In 2015, India's GHI score was 29.2, not 28.7 as stated in pair 1.  In 2023, India's GHI score was 28.7, not 29.2 as stated in pair 2. India was indeed ranked 111th among 125 countries in the 2023 GHI report, making pair 3 correct.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) demonstrate the importance of precise recall of numerical data related to the GHI. The question tests the ability to recall specific numerical values associated with the GHI rankings.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GANHRI (Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions) does indeed focus on accrediting NHRIs, making pair 1 correct. The UNCRC (UN Committee on the Rights of the Child) monitors the Convention, not the UNPFII (UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues).  The CSTT (Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology) focuses on developing technical terminology in Indian languages, making pair 3 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) demonstrate the need for precise knowledge of the mandates of different international organizations. The question assesses the ability to associate organizations with their specific functions.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE organizes schooling into a 5+3+3+4 structure, differing from the older 4-stage model.  While the older model included Foundational, Preparatory, Middle, and Secondary stages, the NCF-SE's emphasis is different. Option (c) correctly identifies two accurate pairings. The Middle stage (ages 11-14) does indeed incorporate interdisciplinary areas of study, fostering a holistic approach to learning. Similarly, the Secondary stage (ages 14-18) strongly emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving skills.  Option (a) is incorrect because vocational education is introduced later in the schooling, not in the foundational stage. Option (b) is incorrect as environmental education is integrated across all stages, not solely in the preparatory stage. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairings mentioned above.  The NCF-SE aims for a comprehensive and integrated approach to education, blending various subjects and skills development throughout the different stages.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system, consider the following pairs:**

    Year of PGI Report Release           Highest Grade Attained
    1. 2017-18                          :   Prachesta-2
    2. 2021-22                          :   Daksh
    3. 2020-21 & 2022 combined       :   Utkarsh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PGI, a system for assessing school education performance at State and District levels, uses a ten-grade classification. The first PGI report (2017-18) showed no state/UT achieving the highest grade ('Daksh'), and the highest grade attained was 'Prachesta-2'. This makes pair 1 correct.  Pair 2 is incorrect;  'Daksh' was not the highest grade achieved in 2021-22. Pair 3 is incorrect because the combined report for 2020-21 and 2021-22 also did not show any district reaching 'Utkarsh' or 'Daksh'. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The PGI highlights disparities in educational performance across different states and districts, providing insights for targeted interventions to improve the quality of school education.


**3. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs), consider the following pairs:**

    Regulation/Act                     Provision
    1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2019 :  Institutions less than 20 years old can apply for DtbU status.
    2. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 :  Institutions must compulsorily create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for students.
    3. UGC Act, 1956                     :  Provides for the declaration of institutions as DtBUs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UGC Act of 1956 empowers the central government to grant Deemed-to-be University status to eligible institutions, making pair 3 correct. The 2023 regulations mandate the creation of ABC identities for students in DtBUs, making pair 2 correct. However, pair 1 is incorrect; the 2019 regulations stipulated that institutions needed to exist for at least 20 years to apply for DtbU status – this was changed in the 2023 regulations.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The DtBU status grants greater autonomy to institutions, enabling them to offer a wider range of courses and contribute to higher education in India.


**4. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

    Framework                                 Feature
    1. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)  :  Integrates credits from vocational and skill education.
    2. National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)             :  Deals with school education credits.
    3. National Curriculum Framework (NCF)/National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF) :  Covers higher education credits.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF is a meta-framework integrating credits from school, higher, vocational, and skill education.  None of the given pairs are fully accurate. The NHEQF deals specifically with higher education, while the NSQF focuses on vocational and skill education. The NCF/NSEQF addresses school education credits.  Therefore, the NCrF integrates all three frameworks (NHEQF, NSQF, NCF/NSEQF), but each framework does not individually encompass credits from other areas as suggested in the pairs. The NCrF aims to enhance flexibility and mobility within India's education system.


**5. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following pairs:**

    Offence                                     Description
    1. Employing manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines :  A violation of the PEMSR Act.
    2. Constructing insanitary latrines                 :  Not a violation of the PEMSR Act.
    3. Employing people to clean sewers without protective gear :  A violation of the PEMSR Act.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PEMSR Act aims to eradicate manual scavenging and rehabilitate those engaged in it.  Employing manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines and employing people to clean sewers without protective gear are both explicit violations of the Act, making pairs 1 and 3 correct.  However, constructing insanitary latrines is a violation, making pair 2 incorrect.  The Act mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines, but the act of merely constructing them, while contributing to the problem, is not explicitly listed as a standalone offense in the same way as employing people in hazardous conditions without protection. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The PEMSR Act represents a significant step towards improving sanitation and protecting the dignity of workers.


**6. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following pairs:**

    Provision                                   Specific Detail
    1. Reservation in Government jobs          :  Not less than 5% reservation in higher educational institutions.
    2. Free Education for Children with Benchmark Disabilities :  Applicable to children aged 6 to 18 years.
    3. Definition of "Person with benchmark disability" :  A person with less than 40% of a specified disability.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act mandates provisions for the rights and inclusion of people with disabilities. Pair 1 is incorrect; the Act specifies not less than 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%, and not less than 5% reservation in higher educational institutions. Pair 2 is correct; the Act guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18. Pair 3 is incorrect; a "Person with benchmark disability" is defined as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability, not less than 40%.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The RPwD Act is crucial in promoting inclusivity and equal opportunities for persons with disabilities.


**7. With reference to the  Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

    Year of GHI Report                      India's GHI Score and Categorization
    1. 2015                                 :  28.7, categorized as Serious
    2. 2023                                 :  29.2, categorized as Serious
    3. 2023                                 :  28.7, categorized as Moderate

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GHI measures and ranks countries based on hunger levels.  All three pairs are incorrect.  In 2015, India's GHI score was 29.2, not 28.7. In 2023, India's score was 28.7, and the categorization was “Serious”, not "Moderate". The GHI uses a scale and categorization system to assess the severity of hunger.  The discrepancies in the pairs highlight the complexities in assessing and interpreting hunger data.  The GHI serves as a tool for monitoring progress toward reducing hunger and malnutrition globally.


**8. With reference to the  Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), consider the following pairs:**

    ODF Status Level                         Criteria
    1. ODF                                  :  Every household and public/community institution uses safe sanitation technology.
    2. ODF Plus                              :  Sustained ODF status with arrangements for solid waste management only.
    3. ODF Plus Model Village                 :  Sustained ODF status, visual cleanliness, and IEC messages.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Swachh Bharat Mission aims to achieve ODF status (Open Defecation Free) and aims for higher ODF plus status. Pair 1 correctly defines the ODF status as the absence of open defecation and the use of safe sanitation technologies in all households and public institutions.  Pair 2 is partially correct; ODF Plus requires sustained ODF status plus implementing either solid or liquid waste management systems; it doesn't require *only* solid waste management. Pair 3 is correct; an ODF Plus Model Village goes beyond basic ODF Plus by incorporating visual cleanliness and IEC (Information, Education, and Communication) messages.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are completely accurate. The ODF Plus initiative represents a significant advancement in rural sanitation efforts.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Educational Initiative                     Feature
1. National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) :  Focuses on a 5+3+3+4 design of schooling
2. National Credit Framework (NCrF)          : Integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education
3.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)           : Stores academic credits earned from various institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) is indeed structured around a 5+3+3+4 design, reflecting the age groups in the proposed schooling system (3-8, 8-11, 11-14, 14-18 years respectively). The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to seamlessly integrate credits earned through various educational pathways—school, higher education, and vocational training—promoting flexibility and mobility for learners. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) serves as a digital repository for academic credits, allowing students to accumulate and transfer credits earned from diverse institutions.  All three pairs accurately reflect the core features of these educational initiatives. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect, omitting at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Higher Education Policy Feature           Description
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target      : 50% by 2035
2. Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) :  To be established across the country for multidisciplinary education
3. National Research Foundation (NRF)       : To catalyse and expand research and innovation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 in India sets a target of at least 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education by 2035.  The policy also envisions the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) across the country to promote high-quality multidisciplinary education and research.  Furthermore, a significant aspect of the NEP is the creation of a National Research Foundation (NRF) to stimulate and expand research and innovation nationwide.  All three pairs accurately represent key aspects of the NEP 2020's higher education initiatives.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they do not include all the correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

    State/UT                                  PGI Grade in 2021-22
1. Punjab                                     : Prachesta-2
2. Arunachal Pradesh                         : Akanshi-3
3. Chandigarh                                  : Prachesta-2

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22 correctly classified Punjab and Chandigarh as achieving the Prachesta-2 grade, indicating a relatively high level of performance in school education.  Simultaneously, Arunachal Pradesh was placed in the lowest grade, Akanshi-3, highlighting the need for significant improvement in its school education system.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched according to the PGI 2.0 report. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBU) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulation/Provision                                 Feature
1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 : Allows institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DTBU status
2. UGC Act 1956                                          : Grants the Central Government the power to declare an institution a DTBU
3.  National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) :  Cannot offer its own graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, significantly altered the eligibility criteria for applying for Deemed-to-be University (DTBU) status, allowing institutions less than 20 years old to apply, unlike the previous 2019 regulations. The UGC Act 1956 empowers the Central Government to grant the DTBU status to eligible institutions.  However, the NCERT, after being granted DTBU status, *can* offer its own graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits a correctly matched pair. Option (c) is incorrect due to the inclusion of an incorrectly matched pair. Option (d) is also incorrect because it includes an incorrectly matched pair.



**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

    Educational Level                          NCrF Level
1.  School Education                            : Levels 1-4
2. Higher Education                             : Levels 4.5-8
3. Vocational Education and Training         : Levels 1-8

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF organizes educational levels into a comprehensive framework.  School education is categorized under Levels 1-4, higher education spans Levels 4.5-8, and vocational education and training encompasses Levels 1-8.  All three pairs accurately reflect the NCrF's level assignments. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they do not include all correctly matched pairs.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                 Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                         : Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
2. UNDESA                                      : Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3. UNHCR                                        : India Ageing Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023.  The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) is known for reports like the State of World Population, and the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) publishes reports on forced displacement. The India Ageing Report 2023 was released by UNFPA in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS). Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to incorrectly matched pairs.


**7. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

    Country/Region                         GHI Score/Ranking
1. India                                       : 111th
2. South Asia                                  : 27.0
3. Sub-Saharan Africa                         : 27.0

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 GHI report ranked India 111th among 125 countries.  Both South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa recorded a GHI score of 27.0, indicating serious levels of hunger in these regions.  All three pairs represent data accurately reflected in the 2023 GHI report.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                      Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Bans manual scavenging
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016   : Mandates 5% reservation in higher educational institutions for PwDs
3.  National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019 :  Regulates dental education and profession

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly prohibits the practice of manual scavenging. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates at least a 5% reservation for persons with disabilities in higher educational institutions. The National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, regulates medical education and practice, not dental education (that falls under the National Dental Commission Act, 2023).  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Amendment                                  Key Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024  : Allows surrogacy using donor gametes under specific conditions
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971: Allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women
3. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a child as a person below 18 years of age

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced modifications to the 2021 Surrogacy Act, allowing surrogacy with donor gametes under specific medical circumstances. The MTP Act, 1971, as amended in 2021, permits pregnancy termination up to 20 weeks for all women.  The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, defines a child as someone under 18 years of age.  All three pairs accurately reflect the key features of the respective acts and amendments. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**10. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Worker Category                             Key Responsibility
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)                  :  Provides early childhood care and development services
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)              : Focuses on maternal and child health promotion
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA)  :  Primarily involved in curative care and supplies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) are primarily responsible for providing early childhood care and development services within the ICDS scheme.  Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) play a crucial role in promoting maternal and child health, including immunizations. ASHAs primarily focus on health awareness, counseling, and referral, not directly on curative care and supplies.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Emphasis                     Stage of Schooling
1. Development of capacities for scientific inquiry : Foundational Stage (Ages 3-8)
2.  Interdisciplinary areas of study           : Secondary Stage (Ages 14-18)
3. Environmental Education                  :  Preparatory Stage (Ages 8-11)
4.  Vocational Education                      : Middle Stage (Ages 11-14)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE, aligned with the NEP 2020, emphasizes a holistic approach to education. While environmental education is integrated throughout all stages,  interdisciplinary areas of study are specifically highlighted as a separate subject at the Secondary Stage (ages 14-18).  The development of capacities for scientific inquiry is a crucial element across all stages, but it's not exclusively confined to the foundational stage. Vocational education, although integrated across stages,  is not the primary focus of the middle stage. Therefore, only pair 2 accurately reflects the specific stage at which the educational emphasis is prominently featured in the NCF-SE.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include mismatched pairs, demonstrating a lack of precise understanding of the NCF-SE's stage-wise educational focus.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for School Education, consider the following pairs:**

   PGI Aspect                                     Data Source/Characteristic
1.  Highest Grade Attained in PGI 2.0 (2021-22) : Daksh
2.  States/UTs in Lowest Grade (Akanshi-3)     :  Punjab and Chandigarh
3.  Data used for PGI and PGI-D                  : UDISE+ 2021-22 data and NAS 2021
4.  Purpose of PGI and PGI-D                     : Assessment of higher education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PGI and PGI-D utilize data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS).  Option (b) correctly identifies this data source. Option (a) is incorrect because no state/UT attained the highest grade "Daksh" in PGI 2.0; Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the top grade of "Prachesta-2". Option (d) is incorrect because  Punjab and Chandigarh were not in the lowest grade. Option (c) is incorrect as PGI assesses school education, not higher education.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the PGI's data sources and purpose, requiring precise knowledge of the PGI's findings.


**3. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Metric/Institution            Characteristic/Ranking
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in 2021-22      : 50%
2.  Top-ranked Indian University (Times Higher Education 2024) : University of Oxford
3.  Number of Indian Universities in Times Higher Education 2024 ranking: 75
4.  Institution granted Deemed to be University status (2023) :  Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCERT was granted Deemed to be University status in 2023. This is accurately reflected in pair 4. Option (a) is incorrect; the GER in 2021-22 was 28.4%, not 50%. Option (b) is correct. Option (c) is incorrect;  91 Indian universities were ranked in Times Higher Education 2024. Option (d) is incorrect; University of Oxford is not an Indian university.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNDESA released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023, and the World Food Programme (WFP) publishes the Global Report on Food Crisis. These are correctly matched in pairs 2 and 4.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Global 2000 report was released by the Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR), not UNFPA.  Pair 3 is incorrect; the India Ageing Report 2023 was released by UNFPA, not IFPRI.  The question assesses factual recall and association of organizations with their specific reports and initiatives, requiring precise knowledge of international organizations and their publications.


**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   NCrF Aspect                                 Characteristic
1.  Levels 1-4                                   : Higher Education
2.  Levels 4.5-8                                  : Vocational Education
3.  Credit storage                               : Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)
4.  Total notional learning hours/year            : 1000


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF uses the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) for storing credits earned through various educational pathways. This is correctly matched in pair 3.  Pair 1 is incorrect; levels 1-4 refer to school education, not higher education. Pair 2 is incorrect; levels 4.5-8 encompass higher education, not exclusively vocational education. Pair 4 is incorrect; the total notional learning hours per year are 1200, not 1000. The question tests factual knowledge of the NCrF's structure, credit system, and learning hour calculations, demanding precise understanding of its components.


**1. With reference to Child Labour in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                      Key Feature

3. PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal : Primarily focuses on rescuing and rehabilitating child labourers
4. ILO Convention 138                 :  Deals with the minimum age of employment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  Option 1 is incorrect due to this age discrepancy. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development, making option 2 incorrect. The PENCiL portal is indeed managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment and plays a crucial role in rescuing and rehabilitating child labourers, making option 3 correct. ILO Convention 138 does concern the minimum age for admission to employment, aligning with option 4. Therefore, only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of specific legislation related to child labour in India.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring candidates to possess precise knowledge of the Acts and Schemes.


**2. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment/Provision              Specific Detail
1. JJ Act, 2015                         :  Introduced a provision allowing children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults for heinous offences.
2. JJ Amendment Act, 2021             :  District Magistrates can issue adoption orders.
3. JJ Act, 2015                         : Adoption of a child is finalized only after a High Court order.
4. JJ Amendment Act, 2021             : Redefined 'serious offences' based on Supreme Court recommendations in Shilpa Mittal v. State of NCT of Delhi case.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, did introduce a provision for trying children aged 16-18 as adults for heinous offenses, making pair 1 correct.  The 2021 amendment empowered District Magistrates to issue adoption orders, making pair 2 correct.  Pair 3 is incorrect; under the 2015 Act, adoption was finalized by a civil court, not a High Court.  Finally, the 2021 amendment did redefine 'serious offences,' aligning with Supreme Court recommendations in the Shilpa Mittal case, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the amendments and key provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act. Distractors play on the subtle differences between the 2015 Act and the 2021 amendments.


**3. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 and its amendments, consider the following pairs:**

   Rule/Amendment                     Specific Provision
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 : Allows surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete is from the intending couple.
2. Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2022           :  Prohibited the use of donor gametes in all cases.
3. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021             : Allows commercial surrogacy with appropriate regulations.
4. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 : Allows single women (widows or divorcees) to undergo surrogacy using only self-eggs and donor sperm.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 amendment to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act indeed permits surrogacy with donor gametes under the condition that at least one gamete originates from the intending couple, making pair 1 correct. The 2022 rules initially prohibited the use of donor gametes in all scenarios, making pair 2 correct.  However, pair 3 is incorrect; the 2021 Act explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, only allowing altruistic surrogacy.  Pair 4 is also correct; the 2024 amendment specifically addresses the conditions under which single women can utilize surrogacy. Thus, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of the evolving legal framework around surrogacy in India, highlighting the amendments and their specific provisions.  The distractors are carefully chosen to reflect the complexities of the legislation.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                 Specific Detail
1. Reservation for PwDs in Government jobs   :  Not less than 4% reservation, applicable to all government services including the police force.
2. Definition of "Person with benchmark disability" : A person with at least 40% of a specified disability.
3. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities :  Available for children between the ages of 6 and 18, in any school of their choice.
4.  Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD          : Set up under the Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The definition of "Person with benchmark disability" as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability is accurate, making pair 2 correct.  The provision for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between ages 6 and 18 in a school of their choice is also correctly stated in pair 3.  However, pair 1 is incorrect; the 4% reservation in government jobs does *not* apply to police forces.  Pair 4 is also incorrect; while the Office of Chief Commissioner for PwDs does deal with disability rights, it was established under the 2016 Act, not the 1995 Act. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests detailed knowledge of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act and its specific provisions regarding reservations, definitions, and access to education.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise understanding of the Act's nuances.


**5. With reference to Manual Scavenging in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                           Specific Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Defines manual scavengers as those handling undecomposed human waste without protective gear.
2. NAMASTE (National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem) scheme : A joint initiative of the Ministries of Social Justice & Empowerment and Rural Development.
3. Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) : Aims to rehabilitate identified manual scavengers through alternate employment.
4. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                : Provides concessional loans for purchasing sanitation-related equipment.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 2013 Act accurately defines manual scavengers as those handling human waste without protective gear, making pair 1 correct.  The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) does aim to rehabilitate manual scavengers, making pair 3 correct.  Swachhta Udyami Yojana does offer concessional loans for sanitation equipment, making pair 4 correct.  However, pair 2 is incorrect; NAMASTE is a joint initiative of the Ministries of Social Justice & Empowerment and Housing and Urban Affairs, not Rural Development. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. This question assesses knowledge of legislation and schemes related to manual scavenging and its eradication in India.  The distractors test the candidate's ability to recall specific details of the schemes and their implementing ministries.


**6. With reference to Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Group                          Specific Detail
1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) : First recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
2. PM JANMAN (PM- Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan) :  Has an estimated outlay of ₹24104 crore for 5 years.
3. Odisha                                  : Houses the highest number of PVTGs in India.
4.  De-notified Tribes (DNTs)             : All DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs were indeed first recognized in 1973 as PTGs, making pair 1 correct. Odisha does house the highest number of PVTGs, making pair 3 correct.  The statement that all DNTs are nomadic tribes but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs is also true, making pair 4 correct. However, pair 2 is incorrect; PM JANMAN's estimated outlay is for 3 years, not 5. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of tribal demographics, government schemes, and the categorization of tribal groups in India.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring precise knowledge of the details of the scheme and the number of years of outlay.


**7. With reference to Women's Issues in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                 Key Feature
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :  Defines domestic violence to include only physical and sexual abuse.
2. Boeing Sukanya Program                        :  Focuses on supporting girls' entry into the aviation sector.
3.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, as amended in 2021 : Allows abortion up to 24 weeks for all women.
4.  National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5        :  Reported higher spousal abuse percentages in Karnataka than in other states.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Boeing Sukanya program accurately focuses on supporting girls' entry into aviation, making pair 2 correct. The NFHS-5 data did show higher spousal abuse in Karnataka compared to certain other states, making pair 4 correct. However, pair 1 is incorrect; the PWDVA defines domestic violence more broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. Pair 3 is also incorrect; the amended MTP Act allows abortion up to 24 weeks only for specific categories of women, not all women.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. This question assesses knowledge of various acts, schemes, and data related to women's issues in India.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the nuances of each provision.


**8. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Institution                           Specific Detail
1. National Credit Framework (NCrF)          : Divides education into 7 levels, integrating school, higher, and vocational education.
2. National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) : Includes a new subject, Agriculture & Allied Sectors, in its 2023 edition.
3.  Deemed-to-be Universities (DTbUs)         : Institutions less than 20 years old are ineligible to apply for DtbU status.
4.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2023 :  Allows foreign HEIs to offer online programs in India.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF divides education into 8 levels, not 7, integrating various forms of education, making pair 1 partially incorrect.  NIRF did include Agriculture & Allied Sectors in its 2023 edition, making pair 2 correct.  Pair 3 is incorrect; the 2023 regulations for DTbUs allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply.  Pair 4 is also incorrect; the regulations specifically prohibit foreign HEIs from offering online programs. Therefore, only pair 2 is fully correct, although pair 1 is partially correct. This question tests knowledge of higher education policies, regulations, and ranking frameworks in India. The distractors use close but incorrect details to challenge the candidate's precise understanding of the frameworks.


**9. With reference to Nutrition and Sanitation in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                        Specific Detail
1. Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus village :  Requires arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management.
2.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem : Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning and sewer worker deaths.
3. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                   : Provides concessional loans for purchasing sanitation-related equipment.
4.  Global Hunger Index (GHI)                  : Measures hunger using only child malnutrition indicators.

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

An ODF Plus village does require arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, making pair 1 correct. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning and sewer worker deaths, making pair 2 correct. Swachhta Udyami Yojana does offer concessional loans, making pair 3 correct. However, pair 4 is incorrect; the GHI uses multiple indicators, including undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality, not just child malnutrition.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. This question assesses knowledge of sanitation schemes and indices related to nutrition and sanitation.  The distractors test the candidate's understanding of the scope and indicators used by the GHI.





**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                    State/Union Territory

4.  Chenchus                               :   Odisha
5. Konda Reddis                            :   Andhra Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Option (c) correctly identifies the Bharia and Kamar tribes as being associated with Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and the Konda Reddis with Andhra Pradesh.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes one correctly matched pair.  Option (b) is partially correct but omits the Konda Reddis.  Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the Baiga tribe, which is not exclusively found in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Chenchus are primarily found in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, not Odisha.  Understanding the geographical distribution of PVTGs is crucial for comprehending India's tribal diversity and the specific challenges faced by these communities. This question tests factual recall and analysis of geographical distribution of tribal groups.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Provision
1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 : Defines domestic violence as only physical abuse.
2.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Allows for the continued employment of manual scavengers under specific conditions.
3.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016      :  Mandates 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.
4.  The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 :  Prohibits discrimination against transgender persons in all aspects of life except employment.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the given pairs are incorrectly matched. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, defines domestic violence comprehensively, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, strictly prohibits the employment of manual scavengers, with exceptions only for those using protective gear. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates reservation for PwDs in government jobs but with certain exceptions, not applicable to all government jobs. Lastly, The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, prohibits discrimination across various sectors, including employment. This question tests the understanding of key social welfare legislation, focusing on factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in presented information.  The question requires careful evaluation of each statement.


**3. With reference to Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

    Commission/Act                     Recommendation/Provision
1.  The UN Dhebar Commission (1961) :  Renamed Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) as PVTGs in 2006.
2.  The Idate Commission                :  Recommended setting up a permanent commission for DNTs.
3.  The 97th Constitutional Amendment : Made the right to form cooperative societies a fundamental right.
4.  Forest Rights Act, 2006              :  Granted Habitat Rights to Bharia PVTG only in Madhya Pradesh.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correctly matched. The Idate Commission did recommend the establishment of a permanent commission for De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs). Statement 1 is incorrect; while the Dhebar Commission's recommendations led to the initial recognition of PTGs, the renaming to PVTGs occurred later by the Government of India. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the 97th Constitutional Amendment related to cooperative societies, not tribal welfare directly.  Statement 4 is incorrect because the Forest Rights Act, 2006, granted Habitat Rights to multiple PVTGs in multiple states, not only to the Bharia tribe exclusively in Madhya Pradesh.  This question tests knowledge of various commissions and acts related to tribal welfare, demanding accurate factual recall and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct concepts.  The inclusion of plausible distractors makes the question challenging.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Report/Initiative
1.  UNFPA                                          :  Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2.  UNDESA                                         :  India Ageing Report 2023
3.  UNHCR                                          :  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
4.  IFPRI                                           :  Global Food Policy Report 2023
5.  World Health Organization (WHO)                :  Triple Threat Report on WASH


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 4 and 5 are correctly matched. The IFPRI released the Global Food Policy Report 2023, and the World Health Organization released the report on the Burden of disease attributable to unsafe WASH.  The UNFPA is associated with the State of World Population report, not the displacement report.  UNDESA publishes the World Social Report and other reports related to sustainable development but not the India Ageing Report.  The UNHCR focuses on refugee issues, not SDG progress reports. This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their respective publications, requiring strong factual recall and the ability to associate organizations with their area of expertise.  The incorrect options provide plausible but ultimately false connections, increasing the difficulty.


**5. With reference to Child Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                  Key Feature/Objective
1.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 :  Allows employment of children below 14 years in non-hazardous occupations.
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :  Defines a child as a person who has not completed 16 years of age.
3.  POCSO Act, 2012                             : Fixes the age of consent for sexual activity at 16 years.
4.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme     : Aims to rehabilitate child laborers through vocational training only.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The Child Labour Act prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations. The Juvenile Justice Act defines a child as someone below 18 years, with provisions for trying 16-18 year olds as adults in heinous crimes.  The POCSO Act sets the age of a child at 18, making it the default age of consent. The NCLP scheme aims at rehabilitation through various means including education and not solely vocational training. This question tests knowledge of legislation and schemes relating to child welfare, demanding thorough understanding of the details of each act and scheme. The incorrect options are designed to mislead those with partial knowledge.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

  Act/Amendment                                  Provision Related to Women
1.  MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021                     : Allows termination of pregnancy only up to 12 weeks for all women.
2.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023             : Criminalizes marital rape explicitly.
3.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :  Provides only criminal remedies for domestic violence.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women, and extends it under specific conditions beyond that. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, does not explicitly criminalize marital rape. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provides civil remedies, not solely criminal ones.  This question tests knowledge of laws related to women's rights, requiring precise understanding of the provisions of each act.  The incorrect options offer plausible but inaccurate interpretations of the laws.  The question highlights the complexities of legal provisions concerning women's rights.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Law                                      Key Provision/Feature

2.  Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 :  Addresses economic exploitation of weaker sections.
3.  Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 : Criminalizes organ trade for profit.
4.  POCSO Act, 2012                        :  Sets the age of consent for sexual activity at 18.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, primarily aims to combat immoral trafficking and, consequently, sex work. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, directly addresses the issue of bonded labor, a form of economic exploitation prevalent in certain segments of society.  The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, criminalizes the commercial aspect of human organ trade.  Finally, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, while encompassing various forms of child sexual abuse, implicitly establishes 18 years as the age of consent by defining a "child" as anyone below 18.  The other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  Understanding these acts is crucial for comprehending the legal framework surrounding social issues in India.


**2. With reference to laws related to children in India, consider the following pairs:**

Act/Law                                      Specific Provision
1.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a child as a person below 16 years of age.
2.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 : Prohibits employment of children below 18 years in hazardous occupations.
3.  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 :  Governs adoption procedures exclusively for Hindu families.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correctly matched. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, defines a child as someone below 18 years, with provisions for treating 16-18-year-olds as adults in heinous crimes. The Child Labour Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in any occupation and those between 14-18 years in hazardous occupations.  The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, applies to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs, not exclusively Hindus. The other options are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair, demonstrating a lack of precise understanding of the specific provisions within these acts. The question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of child-related legislation in India, a crucial area for civil services aspirants.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Law                                           Significant Amendment or Feature
1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 : Defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse.
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (as amended) : Allows abortion up to 24 weeks for all women.
3.  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 : Mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations with 5 or more employees.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, defines domestic violence broadly, encompassing physical, sexual, emotional, economic, and verbal abuse. The MTP Act, as amended, allows abortion up to 20 weeks for all women and up to 24 weeks under certain specific circumstances. The POSH Act mandates ICCs in organizations with 10 or more employees, not 5.  The incorrectness of each statement highlights the need for candidates to possess accurate knowledge of the nuances of these crucial laws impacting women's rights and well-being in India.


**4. With reference to the rights and welfare of vulnerable groups in India, consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy                                  Specific Provision or Focus
1.  Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 :  Prohibits discrimination solely in employment.
2.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Focuses exclusively on the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.
3.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 : Mandates 5% reservation in all government jobs for persons with disabilities.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct. The Transgender Persons Act, 2019, prohibits discrimination across various spheres, including employment, education, healthcare, and housing. The Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, addresses both the prohibition of manual scavenging and the rehabilitation of those engaged in it.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates reservations in government jobs and higher education institutions, but the percentage varies (4% in government jobs, at least 5% in higher education). The inaccuracies in all three statements emphasize the importance of precise factual recall for candidates attempting these questions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization/Initiative                     Primary Goal/Focus
1.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme: Providing vocational training to children.
2.  Bachpan Bachao Andolan: Rescuing children from exploitation and providing rehabilitation.
3.  Prayatna Project: Skill development and entrepreneurship training for transgender individuals.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The NCLP scheme focuses on the rehabilitation of child labourers, including education and skill development, but not exclusively vocational training. Bachpan Bachao Andolan is accurately described as an NGO actively involved in rescuing children from exploitation and providing them with rehabilitation services. The Prayatna Project's objective is accurately presented as providing livelihood and enterprise training to the transgender community. Statement 1 is partially correct but not entirely, hence making option (b) the only correct choice. This highlights the need for precise knowledge of social welfare programs in India.


**6. With reference to government initiatives for tribal welfare, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative/Program                                 Primary Objective
1.  Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) :  Focuses solely on providing healthcare services to PVTGs.
2.  Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission : Aims to saturate PVTG households with basic amenities.
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) :  Exclusively targets the education of DNT children.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correctly matched. PM JANMAN has a broader objective than just healthcare, encompassing various basic amenities. The Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission accurately aims to provide basic necessities to PVTG households.  The SEED scheme, while including educational components, also addresses other aspects of economic empowerment for DNT communities. Option (b) is correct because it accurately reflects the primary objective of one initiative while highlighting the inaccuracies in the others.  This question tests detailed knowledge of government programs aimed at tribal welfare.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Index/Report                                     Key Feature/Characteristic
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI):  Measures only undernourishment.
2.  Global Gender Gap Index: Includes political empowerment as a parameter.
3.  Gender Social Norms Index: Focuses solely on economic aspects of gender inequality.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The GHI measures multiple dimensions of hunger, including undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality rate. The Global Gender Gap Index comprehensively assesses gender equality across four parameters: economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Gender Social Norms Index considers various dimensions of gender inequality, including political, educational, economic, and physical integrity. The partially correct option (c) demonstrates the importance of nuanced understanding of these indices.  This highlights the necessity of knowing the components of various development indices.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Law                                     Key Provision/Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021       :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy
2. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 : Defines domestic violence to include emotional abuse
3. POCSO Act, 2012                        :   Sets the age of consent for sexual activity at 18
4.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Bans the practice of removing human excreta by hand

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly legalizes only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provides a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, sexual, emotional, and economic abuse. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, while not explicitly defining "age of consent" in its title, effectively sets the age at 18 by defining a "child" as someone below 18, thus making any sexual act with a person below 18 a crime under the act. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, directly addresses and prohibits the practice of manual scavenging. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Amendment                                      Significant Change/Provision
1.  MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021                     :   Extended the gestational limit for abortion to 24 weeks for specific categories of women
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (as amended in 2021) :  Allows for the trial of 16-18 year olds as adults in heinous crimes
3. Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 :  Established a National Council for Transgender Persons
4. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016: Prohibits employment of children below 14 years in all employment.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, significantly broadened access to abortion services by extending the gestational limit to 24 weeks under specific circumstances. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, as amended in 2021, introduced a provision allowing for the trial of certain juveniles aged 16-18 as adults for heinous offences. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, established a National Council for Transgender Persons to advise the government on policies and programs related to transgender rights. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, strengthened the prohibition of child labour by banning the employment of children below 14 years in all forms of employment.  Hence, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Scheme/Initiative                      Primary Focus Area
1. National Child Labour Project (NCLP)           :   Rehabilitation of child labourers
2. PENCiL Portal                                  :   Rescuing and rehabilitating child labour victims
3.  PM JANMAN                                     :   Saturation of PVTG households with basic facilities
4. SMILE Scheme                                   : Socio-economic development of transgender persons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) is a central government scheme explicitly designed for the rehabilitation of child labourers.  The PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) portal serves as a key tool in the rescue and rehabilitation efforts for victims of child labour. PM JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan) is a comprehensive initiative focused on providing basic amenities and services to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). SMILE (Support for Marginalised Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise) is a scheme specifically aimed at the socio-economic empowerment of transgender individuals.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the legal frameworks concerning vulnerable groups in India, consider the following pairs:**

Legal Instrument                                       Key Aspect Addressed
1.  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956        :   Governs inter-country adoption of children
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a "child" as a person below 18 years of age
3.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :  Recognizes 21 types of disabilities
4.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :  Prohibits commercial surrogacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, deals with adoption, it primarily focuses on intra-community adoptions within the Hindu faith and does not directly govern inter-country adoptions. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, correctly defines a "child" as a person below 18. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, accurately recognizes 21 types of disabilities. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, successfully prohibits commercial surrogacy.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to organizations involved in social development, consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                          Primary Mandate/Focus
1. UNFPA                                             :   Promoting sexual and reproductive health rights
2.  UNDESA                                           :  Monitoring progress on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
3.  IFPRI                                             :   Research on food security and agricultural policy
4.  NITI Aayog                                        :  Promoting socio-economic development of transgender persons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is primarily focused on promoting sexual and reproductive health rights globally. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) plays a crucial role in monitoring and reporting on the progress of the Sustainable Development Goals. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) conducts extensive research on various aspects of food security and agricultural policy.  NITI Aayog, while involved in overall development planning, does not have a primary mandate specifically dedicated to the socio-economic development of transgender persons; various other ministries and schemes are involved in this. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                             :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                              :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                               :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4.  Hakki Pikki Tribe                        :   Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Option (d) correctly identifies the Hakki Pikki tribe as a semi-nomadic group residing primarily in Karnataka. Option (a) is incorrect as the Bharia tribe is correctly matched with Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Option (b) is incorrect because it incorrectly matches the Kamar tribe with Madhya Pradesh alone, ignoring its presence in Chhattisgarh.  Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs Baiga PVTG with the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; these tribes are not found in that Union Territory.  The question tests factual recall regarding the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups in India.  Understanding the distribution of PVTGs across states is crucial for comprehending India's socio-economic landscape and the challenges faced by these vulnerable communities.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                   Ministry
1.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme    :    Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  PENCiL Portal                              :    Ministry of Labour and Employment
3.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0           :    Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
4.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                      :    Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, focusing on the rehabilitation of child laborers.  The PENCiL portal, a tool for rescuing child laborers, is also managed by the same ministry.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a healthcare initiative under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Option (b) correctly identifies these linkages. Option (a) incorrectly attributes the NCLP scheme to the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Option (c) incorrectly links Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment; it is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly attributes Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. The question assesses factual recall regarding government schemes and their associated ministries, demonstrating an understanding of the organizational structure of Indian governance and its impact on social welfare programs.



**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                         Description
1. Reservation in Government jobs                  :  Not less than 5% reservation in all government jobs
2. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities: Available for children aged 6-18 years, in school of their choice
3. Definition of "Person with benchmark disability" :  A person with at least 20% of a specified disability

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with disabilities, not 5% as stated in option 1.  Option 2 correctly states that children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18 have the right to free education in a school of their choice.  The act defines a "Person with benchmark disability" as someone with not less than 40% of a specified disability, making option 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only option 2 is completely accurate.  This question tests detailed knowledge of the act, going beyond superficial understanding to assess the nuances of its provisions.  Understanding the specific percentages of reservation and the age range for free education is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of the legislation in promoting inclusivity.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                     Releasing Organization
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                     :   Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
2. Global Gender Gap Index                       :   United Nations Development Programme
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)              :   World Economic Forum
4. Gender Social Norms Index                     :   WHO and World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. The UHC Service Coverage Index is a joint release of WHO and the World Bank, not the World Economic Forum. The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the UNDP, not WHO and World Bank. Therefore, only the first pair is correctly matched. This question assesses knowledge of various global indices and their releasing organizations, demanding precise recall of factual information, and highlighting the importance of understanding the sources of data for informed analysis.  The incorrect options create plausible distractors by using organizations closely associated with development and social issues.



**5.  With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Feature                                 Description
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target          :   At least 100% by 2035 in higher education
2.  Multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees:  Certification after first year, Diploma after second year, Bachelor’s degree after third year and Honours degree after fourth year.
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)           :   To catalyse and expand research and innovation across the country

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 targets a GER of at least 50% by 2035 in higher education, not 100% as stated in option 1.  Option 2 accurately describes the multiple exit options within undergraduate programs as outlined in the NEP.  Option 3 correctly identifies the NRF's mandate to promote research and innovation. Therefore, options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question tests detailed understanding of the NEP's provisions, requiring precise recall of numerical targets and the accurate interpretation of policy initiatives. The incorrect options utilize plausible distractors by slightly altering the actual policy details, making it challenging to answer without in-depth knowledge.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Headquarters
1.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Geneva, Switzerland
2.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) :   Washington, D.C., USA
3.  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI):   Rome, Italy
4.  World Food Programme (WFP)                   :   New York, USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., USA, not Geneva, Switzerland.  The UNHCR is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, not Washington, D.C.  GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not Rome, Italy. The WFP's headquarters are in Rome, Italy, not New York, USA. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of the headquarters of international organizations, emphasizing the importance of precise information recall in the context of global governance and international relations.  The incorrect options provide plausible distractors by using cities that frequently host international organizations.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Key Feature
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines
2.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)           :   Focuses solely on liquid waste management
3.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system : Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, indeed criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines and the employment of manual scavengers without protective gear.  The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) encompasses both solid and liquid waste management, not solely liquid waste management.  The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. Therefore, only options 1 and 3 are correctly matched. This question assesses knowledge of sanitation-related policies and acts in India, requiring detailed understanding of their provisions and objectives.  The incorrect options are carefully constructed distractors, testing the candidate's grasp of the nuances of these policies.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Surrogacy                            Description
1.  Altruistic Surrogacy                        :   Involves monetary compensation beyond medical expenses
2.  Commercial Surrogacy                       :   Prohibited under Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
3.  Gestational Surrogacy                       :   Surrogate mother is genetically related to the child

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Altruistic surrogacy does *not* involve monetary compensation beyond basic medical expenses and insurance, making option 1 incorrect. Commercial surrogacy is indeed prohibited under the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021. Gestational surrogacy means the surrogate mother is *not* genetically related to the child, making option 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only option 2 is correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of different types of surrogacy and their legal status in India, demanding precise understanding of the terminology and legal framework.  The incorrect options leverage common misconceptions surrounding surrogacy practices.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

    State                                    Number of PVTGs
1. Odisha                                  :   13
2. Madhya Pradesh                         :   12
3. Chhattisgarh                             :   11
4. Andhra Pradesh                          :   10
5. Jharkhand                               :   9

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Odisha indeed houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  The other numbers presented in the options are distractors designed to test the candidate's knowledge. While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh do have significant PVTG populations, the exact numbers differ from those listed in options (b), (c), and (d).  Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand also have PVTGs, but their numbers are not as high as indicated in the distractor options. The question tests factual recall of specific data related to PVTG distribution across Indian states.  A precise understanding of the data is crucial to arrive at the correct answer, making it a relatively difficult question.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, requiring the candidate to possess accurate information rather than relying on general knowledge.  The inclusion of multiple plausible distractors makes simple elimination strategies ineffective, demanding precise factual recall.


**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

    Commission/Act                            Key Feature/Recommendation
1. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871               :   Repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
2. Renke Commission, 2008                 :   Estimated 15 crore Indians belonging to DNTs and nomadic tribes
3. Idate Commission Report                 :   Recommended establishing a permanent commission for DNTs
4. National Commission for DNTs           :   Prepared a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. The Renke Commission of 2008 provided the estimate of 15 crore Indians belonging to DNTs and nomadic communities. The Idate Commission recommended the establishment of a permanent commission for DNTs. And the National Commission for DNTs was tasked with preparing a state-wise list of DNT castes. This question assesses factual recall regarding various commissions and acts related to DNTs in India. While the information is factual, the question's difficulty arises from the need to recall multiple pieces of specific information accurately, making simple guessing unlikely.  The inclusion of all four correct pairs as options increases the difficulty, forcing candidates to possess detailed knowledge of the subject matter.


**3. Consider the following pairs relating to government schemes for tribal welfare:**

    Scheme                                      Implementing Ministry
1. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi    :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric Scholarship  :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3.  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme                  :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
4. Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) : Ministry of Rural Development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship scheme for DNT boys and girls is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The other options are incorrect.  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi is not exclusively for tribal welfare and is under a different ministry. While the Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme relates to tribal welfare, it's implemented through State Governments, not directly by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  The SEED scheme falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Rural Development. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the implementing ministries for various government schemes related to tribal welfare.  The distractors are designed to confuse candidates who may have partial knowledge but lack precise information about the implementing ministries.  The question emphasizes the importance of detailed knowledge of government schemes and their administrative structures.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision                                    Specific Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs           :   Not less than 5%
2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions: Not less than 4%
3. Free Education for Children with Benchmark Disabilities:  Ages 6 to 18 years
4. Definition of "Person with benchmark disability":  Not less than 50% of specified disability


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, does indeed provide for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18 years.  The other options contain incorrect information. The reservation percentages for government jobs and higher educational institutions are different from those listed in options (a) and (d).  The definition of "Person with benchmark disability" specifies a minimum of 40%, not 50%, disability.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific provisions within the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.  The incorrect options provide plausible but inaccurate figures, increasing the difficulty level and preventing candidates from relying solely on general knowledge.  The question requires a precise understanding of the act's numerical details.


**5. With reference to Manual Scavenging, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                                    Key Provision/Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Punishment of up to 5 years imprisonment
2. National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem: Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning of sewers
3. Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS): Provides concessional loans for sanitation equipment
4. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                    :   Focuses on identifying manual scavengers through a mobile app


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem does aim to eliminate hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. The other pairs are not entirely accurate. The PEMSR Act mandates a maximum of 2 years imprisonment, not 5. The SRMS scheme focuses on rehabilitation through alternative employment, not concessional loans for equipment (that is a feature of Swachhta Udyami Yojana). While the Swachhta app assists in identifying manual scavengers, it is not the primary focus of the app.  This question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between various schemes and acts aimed at tackling manual scavenging. The distractors are carefully crafted to include partially correct information, making the question more challenging and requiring a nuanced understanding of each scheme's specifics.  The question highlights the need for precise knowledge of government initiatives.


**6.  Consider the following pairs related to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

    Policy Aspect                                     Specific Target/Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education :  At least 60% by 2035
2. Undergraduate Degree Duration                  :  Offers only a 4-year option
3. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                   :  Digitally stores academic credits earned from various institutions
4. National Research Foundation (NRF)             :  Focuses primarily on school education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is indeed designed to digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions under NEP 2020.  The other pairs are incorrect. The target GER in higher education is 50%, not 60%.  Undergraduate degrees under NEP 2020 offer both 3 and 4-year options with multiple exit points.  The NRF is focused on research and innovation across higher education and not primarily on school education.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the key features and targets of the NEP 2020.  The distractor options present plausible but inaccurate details, enhancing the difficulty and necessitating a precise understanding of the policy's provisions.  The question emphasizes the importance of detailed knowledge of educational policies and their implementation.



**7. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

    Year                                      Key Feature/Finding
1. PGI 2017-18                               :   Several States/UTs achieved the highest grade (Daksh)
2. PGI 2.0 (2021-22)                          :   Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade (Daksh)
3. PGI-D (2020-21 & 2021-22)                 :   Several districts achieved the top two grades (Daksh and Utkarsh)
4.  Data Source for PGI and PGI-D           :   Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) data is indeed a source for both PGI and PGI-D. The other pairs are incorrect. In PGI 2017-18, no State/UT achieved the highest grade. In PGI 2.0 (2021-22), Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade of Prachesta-2, not Daksh. In PGI-D, no districts achieved the top two grades. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Performance Grading Index, its methodology, and key findings.  The incorrect options present misleading information about the rankings and achievements, thereby increasing the difficulty level and requiring precise recall of the PGI reports' details.  The question emphasizes the importance of detailed understanding of educational assessment frameworks.


**8. Consider the following pairs concerning international organizations and their reports:**

    Organization                                Report Title
1. UNFPA                                     :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2. UNDESA                                    :   India Ageing Report 2023
3. UNHCR                                     :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
4. IFPRI                                      :   Global Food Policy Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) did release the Global Food Policy Report 2023. The other pairs are incorrect. The UNFPA releases the State of World Population report, not the forced displacement report.  UNDESA releases the World Social Report and other development-related reports, not the India Ageing Report. The UNHCR releases reports on refugee trends, not the SDG Progress Report. This question evaluates the candidate's awareness of different international organizations and their key publications. The distractor options cleverly mix the names of organizations and their reports, making it crucial for candidates to possess accurate knowledge about the specific reports released by each organization.  The question emphasizes the importance of familiarity with key publications in international development.


**9. With reference to the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin), consider the following pairs:**

    Status                                      Defining Characteristic
1. ODF                                        :   Every household uses safe sanitation technology
2. ODF Plus                                   :   Sustained ODF status with only solid waste management implemented
3. ODF Plus Model Village                     :   Sustained ODF status with arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management and visual cleanliness
4.  Phase-II of Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen):  Focuses exclusively on urban sanitation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  ODF is defined by the absence of open defecation and the use of safe sanitation technology in every household. An ODF Plus Model Village is characterized by sustained ODF status, arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and appropriate IEC messaging.  Pair 2 is incorrect as ODF Plus includes both solid and liquid waste management systems. Pair 4 is incorrect as Phase-II of Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) focuses on rural sanitation. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the different stages and components of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin). The distractor options present partially correct or misleading information, making it necessary for candidates to have a complete understanding of the program's definitions and phases. The question highlights the importance of detailed knowledge of government programs aimed at sanitation and hygiene improvement.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that some questions might test knowledge beyond simple factual recall, demanding analysis and application of the information presented.

**1. With reference to government initiatives for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Policy                                       Focus Area
    1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                         :  Primary healthcare interventions only
    2. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)         :  National portability of health services
    3. National Health Policy 2017                     :  Achieving UHC at affordable cost
    4. Intensified Mission Indradhanush                :  Reaching zero-dose children aged 0-5 years


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) indeed aims to improve equitable access to quality healthcare by encouraging the use of technologies such as telemedicine and enabling national portability of health services.  The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims at achieving UHC and delivering quality health care services to all at an affordable cost. Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on achieving zero-dose children aged between 0 and 5 years and pregnant women who might have missed any vaccine doses in the national immunization schedule.  Option (a) is incorrect because Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to address health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, not just primary healthcare. Options (b) and (c) are partially correct but incomplete, missing at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Program                              Feature
    1. Saksham Anganwadis                       :  Focuses solely on children (0-6 years)
    2. Poshan Tracker app                          :  Used exclusively for monitoring adult nutrition
    3. Anganwadi Services Scheme (now Saksham) :  Centrally Sponsored Scheme under MoWCD
    4.  ICDS-CAS                                  :  Replaces registers with smartphones for data capture


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the Anganwadi Services Scheme is indeed a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD). The ICDS-Common Application Software (CAS) facilitates the capture of data by frontline functionaries and replaces registers with smartphones. Option (a) is incorrect as Saksham Anganwadis also focus on adolescent girls and early childhood care and education. Option (b) is incorrect because the Poshan Tracker app is used for monitoring child nutrition, not exclusively adult nutrition. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in pairs 1 and 2.


**3. With reference to the key features of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision                                       Specific Detail
    1. Reservation in Government jobs             :  Minimum 4% reservation, applicable to police forces
    2. Free education for children with disabilities :  Applicable to children aged 6-18 years
    3. Recognition of disabilities                   :  Includes intellectual disability and acid attack victims
    4.  Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities:  Operates under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, does indeed recognize intellectual disability and acid attack victims as disabilities. The Office of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities operates under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  Option (a) is incorrect because the 4% reservation in government jobs is *not* applicable to police forces. While option (b) is partially correct, the first pair is incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy in the first pair.


**4. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, consider the following pairs:**

    Offence                                         Description
    1. Employing manual scavengers                   :  Cleaning insanitary latrines without protective gear
    2. Constructing insanitary latrines                 :  Creating latrines that lack basic sanitation standards
    3.  Failing to demolish insanitary latrines        :  Not removing insanitary latrines within the stipulated timeframe
    4. Cleaning sewers without protective gear       :  Using appropriate safety equipment while cleaning sewers


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The Act makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines (lacking basic sanitation) and to not demolish or convert insanitary latrines within a specified period. Option (a) is incorrect because employing manual scavengers is explicitly prohibited, regardless of the use of protective gear.  Option (b) is partially correct, but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because cleaning sewers without protective gear is an offense, while the fourth pair presents the opposite as correct.


**5. With reference to organizations involved in global nutrition and food security, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Key Activity/Report
    1. World Food Programme (WFP)                 :  Released the Global Food Policy Report 2023
    2. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :  Received funding half of operating requirement in 2023
    3.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)      :  Transforming Targeted Public Distribution System in India
    4.  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA): Released the ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) Only three
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only one pair is correctly matched:  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) released the Global Food Policy Report 2023. The other options are incorrect. The World Food Programme (WFP) is involved in food distribution and aid, not in releasing the mentioned report. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) focuses on population issues, not food security. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) deals with broader development issues, not specifically the Global Trends report.  The WFP is involved in transforming the Targeted Public Distribution System, not the UNFPA.  Therefore, only one pair is correctly matched.



**1. With reference to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                  Detail
1. CGIAR                                  : Established in 1961
2. IFPRI                                   : Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland
3. Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research: Major research center for IFPRI
4.  UN General Assembly                 : Established IFPRI in 1975


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is a global partnership established in 1971, not 1961.  IFPRI, established in 1975, is indeed a major research center under the CGIAR umbrella.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect due to the wrong establishment year of CGIAR. Pair 2 is incorrect because IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Geneva.  Pair 4 is incorrect as the UN General Assembly did not establish IFPRI;  it was established within the framework of CGIAR. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the organizational structure of international agricultural research.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, as they involve related organizations and dates, making simple recall insufficient for a correct response.


**2. With reference to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Document                 Detail
1. UNHCR                               : Established in 1967
2. 1951 Refugee Convention             : Key legal document for UNHCR’s work
3. UN General Assembly                  : Established UNHCR in 1950
4. World Health Organization           : Collaborates with UNHCR


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR was established by the UN General Assembly in 1950, making pair 3 correct.  The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are indeed foundational legal documents guiding UNHCR's work, making pair 2 correct.  Pair 1 is incorrect because the UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1967. Pair 4 is incorrect while UNHCR does collaborate with many international organizations, the World Health Organization is not explicitly mentioned as a key collaborator in the provided text. This question assesses factual recall regarding the UNHCR's establishment, key legal frameworks, and collaborative partners.  The incorrect options include plausible but ultimately inaccurate details, demanding precise knowledge of the UNHCR's history and operations.


**3. With reference to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Principle                  Detail
1. GANHRI                               : Established in 1991
2. Paris Principles                        : Adopted in 1993 by the UN General Assembly
3. UN Human Rights Council               : GANHRI represents India at this council
4. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC): GANHRI accredits this institution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GANHRI was established in 1993, not 1991, making pair 1 incorrect. The Paris Principles, adopted in 1993 by the UN General Assembly, are indeed crucial for the development of standards for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), making pair 2 correct. GANHRI's accreditation of the NHRC is mentioned, making pair 4 correct. However, the statement that GANHRI directly represents India at the UN Human Rights Council is not explicitly stated in the text, although the accreditation process indirectly affects India's representation. This question tests factual knowledge of GANHRI's establishment, the Paris Principles, and its relationship with NHRIs, including the NHRC.  The distractors include incorrect years and a nuanced relationship with the UN Human Rights Council, requiring careful consideration of the provided information.


**4.  With reference to the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Characteristic                     Detail
1. UNPFII                               : Established in 2000 by the UN General Assembly
2. UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) : UNPFII reports to this body
3. UN General Assembly                   : UNPFII is a subsidiary organ of this body
4. Trust Fund on Indigenous Issues      : Supports UNPFII activities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNPFII was established in July 2000 by a resolution of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the UN General Assembly.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The UNPFII does indeed report to ECOSOC, making pair 2 correct.  Pair 3 is incorrect because UNPFII is a high-level advisory body to ECOSOC, not a subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly. The Trust Fund on Indigenous Issues does support UNPFII activities, making pair 4 correct.  This question tests knowledge about the UNPFII's establishment, its reporting structure, and funding sources. The distractors involve the correct bodies but misrepresent the hierarchical relationship, requiring a solid understanding of the UN system's structure.



**5. With reference to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following pairs:**

   Framework/Characteristic                Detail
1. NIF                                   : Includes indicators tailored to India's specific requirements
2. Global Indicator Framework (GIF)      : Framed by the UN Statistical Commission
3. IAEG-SDGs                             : Composed of only Member States
4. MoSPI                                 : Developed NIF in 2018


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NIF does include indicators tailored to India's specific needs, making pair 1 correct. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) did develop the NIF in 2018, making pair 4 correct.  However, pair 2 is incorrect; while the GIF's indicators are ultimately used by the UN Statistical Commission, the GIF itself is framed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs). Pair 3 is incorrect as the IAEG-SDGs includes Member States and international agencies as observers. This question assesses knowledge of the NIF, its relationship with the GIF, and the roles of different organizations in SDG indicator development.  The distractors involve related organizations and accurate but incomplete descriptions, demanding precise understanding of the frameworks and their governance.


**6. With reference to the Caste Census, consider the following pairs:**

   Census/Characteristic                    Detail
1. Census of India, 1931                 : Caste-wise data was collected and published
2. Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011: Caste data was finalized and published in 2016
3.  Census Act of 1948                   :  Mandates a full-scale caste census
4. Mandal Commission, 1980              : Estimated OBC population at 52%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 1931 Census of India did include caste-wise data collection and publication, making pair 1 correct. The Mandal Commission (1980) did estimate the OBC population at 52%, making pair 4 correct.  However, pair 2 is incorrect because, while the SECC 2011 collected caste data, it was not fully published by 2016; only other data was published. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Census Act of 1948 provides for a population census but does not mandate a full-scale caste census.  This question tests knowledge of the history of caste enumeration in India, including specific census years and the role of commissions. The distractors involve partially true statements and conflate different aspects of data collection and publication, requiring careful analysis of the information provided.


**7. With reference to Manual Scavenging, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Provision                           Detail

2.  Indian Penal Code                     : Contains provisions for punishment for manual scavenging
3.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system: Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning
4. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                : Provides concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly bans manual scavenging, making pair 1 correct. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning, making pair 3 correct. Swachhta Udyami Yojana does provide concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment, making pair 4 correct. However, the Indian Penal Code (IPC) does not directly address manual scavenging as a specific offense; the 2013 Act provides the main legal framework and penalties.  This question tests understanding of the legal and policy frameworks addressing manual scavenging in India.  The distractors include a plausible but ultimately inaccurate association with the IPC, requiring a clear understanding of the specific legislation involved.


**8. With reference to Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Provision                           Detail
1. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016: Recognizes 21 types of disabilities
2. Office of Chief Commissioner of PwDs: Mandated to safeguard rights of PwDs
3. PwD Act, 1995                          : Provides for the Chief Commissioner for PwDs
4.  RPwD Act 2016                        :  Reservation in police forces is applicable


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, does recognize 21 types of disabilities, making pair 1 correct. The Office of Chief Commissioner of PwDs is indeed mandated to safeguard the rights of PwDs, making pair 2 correct.  The PwD Act, 1995, did provide for the Chief Commissioner for PwDs, making pair 3 correct. However, pair 4 is incorrect; the RPwD Act, 2016, specifically states that reservation is *not* applicable to police forces. This question assesses knowledge of the legal framework for PwDs in India, including specific provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016, and the role of the Chief Commissioner's office.  The distractor involves a key detail about reservation applicability, demanding careful reading and understanding of the legislation.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Virus                                      Characteristic
1. Nipah virus                              :   First recognized in 2001
2. Nipah virus                              :   Symptoms include fever, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting, and sore throat
3. Sickle cell disease                       :   Non-hereditary disease

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement in pair 2 accurately describes the symptoms of the Nipah virus.  Fever, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting, and sore throat are indeed among the common symptoms.  Pair 1 is incorrect; Nipah virus was first recognized in 1998 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia, not 2001.  Pair 3 is also incorrect; sickle cell disease is a hereditary blood disorder, not a non-hereditary one. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall regarding viral characteristics and the nature of sickle cell disease.  The inclusion of incorrect years and a false description of sickle cell disease's hereditary nature serves as effective distractors, testing the candidate's ability to discern accurate information from plausible but incorrect details.  Understanding the difference between symptoms and the year of discovery is crucial for a correct answer.


**2. With reference to healthcare initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                  Objective
1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                :   Focuses exclusively on tertiary healthcare
2. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) :   Aims to improve equitable access to quality healthcare using technology
3. Intensified Mission Indradhanush       :   Targets zero-dose children and pregnant women who missed vaccine doses

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect because Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to address health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, not exclusively tertiary care.  Pair 2 correctly identifies the ABDM's objective of improving equitable access to quality healthcare through technology like telemedicine and national portability of health services.  Pair 3 accurately describes the Intensified Mission Indradhanush's goal of reaching zero-dose children and pregnant women who have missed vaccinations.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question assesses conceptual understanding of Indian healthcare initiatives and their objectives.  The inclusion of an inaccurate description of Ayushman Bharat Yojana's scope serves as a significant distractor, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge of program details to arrive at the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Location of Headquarters
1. International Solar Alliance (ISA)         :   Paris, France
2. International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) :   Geneva, Switzerland
3.  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) : Kathmandu, Nepal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the ISA was launched during COP21 in Paris, its headquarters are not located there.  The IHO's headquarters are in Monaco, not Geneva.  Only the SAARC secretariat is correctly located in Kathmandu, Nepal. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests factual recall of the headquarters of international organizations. The incorrect placement of ISA and IHO headquarters serves as a strong distractor, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of organizational locations.  It tests the candidate's ability to filter out misleading information and identify the only correctly matched pair.


**4. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                            Feature
1. Saksham Anganwadis                     :   Focuses solely on children aged 0-6 years
2. Poshan Tracker application                :   Used exclusively for monitoring weight of children
3. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Helpers (AWHs) :   Receive only a centrally decided honorarium

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Saksham Anganwadis expand beyond children aged 0-6 years, also focusing on adolescent girls and early childhood care and education. Poshan Tracker monitors more than just weight, including stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence. AWWs and AWHs receive a centrally decided honorarium, but many states/UTs also provide additional honorarium from their own resources. Therefore, none of the pairs are completely correctly matched. This tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the Anganwadi system and associated initiatives.  The presence of plausible but partially incorrect statements in each pair creates a high difficulty level, requiring a thorough understanding to identify the correct option.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Key Report/Publication
1. World Health Organization (WHO)             :   Global Hunger Index (GHI)
2.  UNICEF                                      :   Triple Threat Report on WASH
3. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not WHO.  UNICEF correctly released the Triple Threat Report on WASH.  The report on forced displacement was released by UNHCR, not IFPRI.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of reports released by different international organizations. The inclusion of incorrect attributions of reports creates a challenging scenario, demanding precise knowledge to arrive at the correct answer.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's understanding of each organization's focus and activities.


**6. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                      2023 Value for India
1. Undernourishment                            :   18.7%
2. Child Stunting                               :   35.5%
3. Child Wasting                                :   16.6%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 GHI report indicates that child stunting in India was 35.5%.  Undernourishment was 16.6%, and child wasting was 18.7%.  Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific data from the GHI report. The close proximity of the incorrect values to the correct ones increases the difficulty level, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall the precise figures.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Provision
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :   Criminalizes marital rape
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971  :   Allows abortion up to 24 weeks in specific cases
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Mandates the construction of insanitary latrines

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PWDVA 2005 does not criminalize marital rape; it provides civil remedies. The MTP Act, as amended, allows abortion up to 24 weeks under specific conditions. The Manual Scavenging Act prohibits the construction of insanitary latrines. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of key legislation related to women's rights, reproductive health, and social justice.  The incorrect statements regarding the PWDVA and the Manual Scavenging Act serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the Acts' provisions.


**8. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Initiative                          Feature
1. National Credit Framework (NCF)       :   Divides education into 6 levels
2. Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)          :   Stores credits earned only from higher education
3. National Research Foundation (NRF)     :   Focuses solely on natural sciences research

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCF divides education into 8 levels, not 6.  ABC stores credits from school, higher, vocational, and skill education, not just higher education.  NRF encompasses a broader range of research fields beyond natural sciences.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of NEP 2020 and its key initiatives. The inclusion of plausible but partially incorrect descriptions in each pair increases the difficulty level, demanding a thorough understanding to arrive at the correct answer.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the nuances of the NEP's various components.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Report                                   Key Recommendation
1. K. Radhakrishnan Committee                      :   Establishment of a National Accreditation Council (NAC)
2.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls :  Improvement of educational empowerment of DNTs
3.  Idate Commission                              :   Setting up a permanent commission for De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Radhakrishnan Committee's key recommendation was indeed the establishment of NAC. The Ambedkar scholarship scheme aims to improve educational opportunities for DNTs. The Idate Commission recommended a permanent commission for DNTs. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various committees and their recommendations related to education and social welfare. The question is designed to be straightforward, testing direct recall of facts. However, the inclusion of all three correct pairs, without any incorrect distractors, is intentional.  This tests the candidate's ability to accurately assess all the provided information.


**10. With reference to the status of women in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                   Key Finding Related to India
1. Global Gender Gap Index 2023                :   India ranked among top 20 countries
2. Gender Social Norms Index                     :   Measures political, educational, economic, and physical integrity dimensions
3.  Path to Equal Report                          :   Introduced Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) and Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India's ranking in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index was far below the top 20.  The Gender Social Norms Index does indeed measure the four dimensions listed. The Path to Equal Report did introduce WEI and GGPI. Only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various indices and reports related to gender equality. The inclusion of incorrect rankings and partially incorrect descriptions serves as a good distractor, requiring careful attention to detail to identify the correct answer.  The question aims to test the recall of specific data points related to the indices.


**1. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   **Policy Feature**                                 **Specific Detail**
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target            :   At least 50% by 2035
2.  Undergraduate Degree Duration                :   5 years with multiple exit points
3.  Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) :  To achieve highest standards in multidisciplinary education
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035. This is a stated and verifiable goal of the policy.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  The NEP does propose the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) to elevate the standards of multidisciplinary education. This is also a clearly articulated policy objective, making pair 3 correct. However, pair 2 is incorrect. While the NEP does introduce multiple exit options within undergraduate programs, allowing students to leave with certificates, diplomas, or bachelor's degrees after different durations, the standard undergraduate degree duration is not fixed at 5 years.  It offers 3-year and 4-year options, depending on the chosen specialization and exit point. The flexibility is a key feature, but the statement about a fixed 5-year duration is inaccurate. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) and PGI-D, consider the following pairs:**

   **Index Feature**                                 **Specific Observation**
1.  PGI 2.0 (2021-22) Highest Grade Achieved    :   Daksh
2. PGI-D (2020-21 & 2021-22) Top Two Grades Achieved :   Daksh and Utkarsh
3.  PGI 2.0 (2021-22) Lowest Grade Achieved     :   Akanshi-1
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched.  In PGI 2.0 for 2021-22, no state or union territory achieved the highest grade, Daksh. The top grade achieved was Prachesta-2. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Similarly, in the PGI-D report for 2020-21 and 2021-22, none of the districts attained the top two grades, Daksh and Utkarsh. This makes pair 2 incorrect. Finally, in PGI 2.0 (2021-22), the lowest grade achieved was Akanshi-3, not Akanshi-1, making pair 3 also incorrect. Hence, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs related to the  National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

   **Framework Component**                        **Specific Detail**
1.  Levels 1-4                                    :   Higher Education
2. Levels 4.5-8                                   :   Vocational Education & Training
3. Credit Storage Mechanism                       :   National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF divides education into eight levels. Levels 1-4 correspond to school education, not higher education as stated in pair 1.  Levels 4.5-8 refer to higher education, not vocational education and training as indicated in pair 2. Finally, the credits earned through academic, vocational, and skill education are stored in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC), not the NSQF.  The NSQF is a separate framework for vocational and skill education, but it is not the mechanism for storing all credits under the NCrF. Therefore, none of the given pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbU), consider the following pairs:**

   **Regulation Feature**                           **Specific Change**
1.  Minimum Age of Institution for DtbU Status  :   20 years
2.  Eligibility for Cluster of Institutions        :   Allowed
3.  Online/Distance Learning Program Offering   :   Allowed
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The new UGC regulations for DtbUs have reduced the minimum age requirement for institutions applying for DtbU status to less than 20 years, making pair 1 incorrect. The regulations now allow clusters of institutions managed by more than one sponsoring body to apply, thus pair 2 is correctly matched.  However, the regulations explicitly prohibit the offering of online or open and distance learning programs by DtbUs, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**5. Concerning the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) and related indices, consider the following pairs:**

   **Index**                                      **Specific Characteristic**
1.  Global Gender Gap Index                      :   Released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
2.  Gender Social Norms Index                    :   Measures political, educational, economic, and physical integrity dimensions.
3.  Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI)             :   Evaluates women's status relative to men.
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP, making pair 1 incorrect.  The Gender Social Norms Index accurately measures the four dimensions mentioned in pair 2, making it correct. The Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) focuses solely on women's power and freedoms, not on a comparative evaluation against men; the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) performs that comparison, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**6. With reference to the organizations involved in addressing population and development issues, consider the following pairs:**

   **Organization**                               **Specific Function/Report**
1.  UNFPA                                       :   Releases the World Youth Report
2.  UNDESA                                      :   Releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report
3.  UNCPD                                       :   Advises the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While UNFPA works extensively on population issues, the World Youth Report is primarily associated with UNDESA. This makes pair 1 incorrect. UNDESA is indeed responsible for releasing the SDG Progress Report, making pair 2 correct. The UNCPD's core function is to monitor and advise ECOSOC on the implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action, making pair 3 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7.  Concerning the initiatives related to tribal welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   **Initiative**                                 **Specific Feature**
1.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) :   Prepares a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
2.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs :   Exclusively for Scheduled Tribes.
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) :   Provides free competitive exam coaching to DNT students.
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCDNT is tasked with preparing a state-wise list of DNT castes, making pair 1 correct.  The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship scheme is for Denotified Tribes, not exclusively for Scheduled Tribes, making pair 2 incorrect. The SEED scheme does indeed provide competitive exam coaching and other support to DNT students, making pair 3 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the legal frameworks concerning children, consider the following pairs:**

   **Legislation**                                 **Specific Provision**
1.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a child as a person below 18 years of age.
2.  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956  :  Governs inter-country adoption of orphaned children.
3.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 : Prohibits employment of children below 14 years in all employment.
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The JJ Act, 2015, correctly defines a child as a person below 18 years, making pair 1 correct. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act primarily deals with adoptions within the Hindu community and doesn't govern inter-country adoptions, which are handled under the Juvenile Justice Act, making pair 2 incorrect.  The Child Labour Amendment Act, 2016, accurately prohibits the employment of children below 14 years, making pair 3 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**9.  With reference to the initiatives aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, consider the following pairs:**

   **Initiative**                                     **Specific Goal/Feature**
1.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II     :   Achieving ODF status in all villages.
2.  ODF Plus Model Village                          :   Sustaining ODF status and implementing both solid and liquid waste management systems.
3.  National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem :  Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning and prevent sewer worker deaths.
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II aims to achieve ODF Plus status, which goes beyond basic ODF, making pair 1 correct (although the statement mentions achieving basic ODF). An ODF Plus Model Village requires both solid and liquid waste management systems, and visual cleanliness, making pair 2 correct. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem directly addresses hazardous cleaning and sewer worker safety, making pair 3 correct.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**10.  With reference to the various health initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

   **Initiative**                                 **Specific Focus/Goal**
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                      :   Focuses exclusively on tertiary healthcare.
2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)      :   Encourages the use of telemedicine and national portability of health services.
3.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush             :   Aims to achieve zero-dose children and pregnant women who missed vaccine doses.
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to provide health coverage across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, making pair 1 incorrect. The ABDM accurately focuses on telemedicine and health service portability, making pair 2 correct.  The Intensified Mission Indradhanush correctly targets zero-dose children and pregnant women who have missed vaccinations, making pair 3 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                                  State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                            :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                             :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                              :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  However, the provided text specifies that Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga are found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Therefore, only pair 1, listing Bharia PVTG in Chhattisgarh, is correctly matched. Pairs 2 and 3 are incorrect because they incorrectly assign the Kamar and Baiga tribes to a single state.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern accurate information from potentially misleading options. The inclusion of Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a plausible but incorrect option adds to the difficulty.  Understanding the distribution of PVTGs across different states is crucial for comprehending India's tribal demographics and the challenges faced by these communities.  The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of India's tribal populations and their geographical distribution.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                     Key Feature
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :  Criminalizes marital rape.
2.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Defines "manual scavenger" to exclude those using protective gear.
3.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021         :  Allows commercial surrogacy.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, deals with civil remedies for domestic violence and does not criminalize marital rape.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly defines manual scavengers and includes an exception for those using protective gear. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, strictly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of key legislation related to social justice issues in India.  The inclusion of incorrect information in options 1 and 3 serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall and apply the details of these acts. The question demands precise factual knowledge of the acts' provisions and highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of Indian law concerning vulnerable populations.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision                                          Feature
1. Reservation in Government jobs                  :   4% reservation for PwDs
2. Reservation in Police Forces                     :   5% reservation for PwDs
3. Free education for children with benchmark disability : Applicable to children aged 6-18 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs, making statement 1 correct.  It explicitly excludes police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT police) from this reservation, making statement 2 incorrect.  The Act guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18 years, making statement 3 correct. The question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the act's provisions concerning PwDs.  The inclusion of the incorrect statement about police force reservations acts as a significant distractor, demanding precise knowledge of the Act's exceptions. The question assesses the candidate's ability to identify accurate information from a set of closely related but not entirely accurate statements, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the law's specifics.  It also highlights the legal framework and policies related to disability rights in India.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                    Key Function/Mandate

2.  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) :  Accredits National Human Rights Institutions based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
3.  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) :  Advises the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on indigenous issues.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCDNT is indeed tasked with preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), making statement 1 correct. GANHRI accredits National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Paris Principles, not the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, making statement 2 incorrect.  The UNPFII serves as a high-level advisory body to the UN ECOSOC on indigenous issues, making statement 3 correct.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various national and international organizations working on social justice and human rights issues.  The incorrect information in statement 2 serves as a key distractor, requiring precise knowledge of GANHRI's accreditation criteria. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the mandates and functions of different organizations involved in addressing social issues, both at the national and international levels.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Provision                                    Aim/Feature
1. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                    :   Digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions
2.  National Research Foundation (NRF)              :   Promote multidisciplinary education and research
3.  Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) : Catalyse and expand research and innovation across the country


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is designed to digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions, making statement 1 correct.  The National Research Foundation (NRF) aims to catalyse and expand research and innovation across the country, while MERUs are intended to promote multidisciplinary education and research. Therefore, statement 3 is correct, and statement 2 is incorrect. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the key features and aims of NEP 2020 in higher education.  The subtle difference between the aims of NRF and MERUs creates a plausible distractor, demanding a precise understanding of the policy's provisions. The question tests the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts within the NEP 2020 framework.  It demonstrates an understanding of the policy's goals and mechanisms for achieving them in the Indian higher education system.





**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Headquarters
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Geneva, Switzerland
2. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Washington, D.C., USA
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR's headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland.  The IFPRI is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA. GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland.  Therefore, only the pairing of UNHCR with its correct headquarters is accurate. The other pairings present incorrect headquarters locations, serving as effective distractors designed to test the candidate's knowledge of these important international organizations.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to correctly associate organizations with their locations, a crucial skill for understanding global governance and international relations. The incorrect options are strategically designed to include plausible, yet false, headquarters locations for these organizations, making simple guessing improbable.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                          Releasing Organization
1. Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report : World Food Programme (WFP)
2. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023 : UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
3. India Ageing Report 2023                       : United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" was released by the UNHCR, not the WFP. The "Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023" was indeed released by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA). The "India Ageing Report 2023" was jointly released by the UNFPA and the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).  Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of key reports released by various UN organizations and assesses their ability to correctly match the reports with their respective releasing organizations.  The incorrect options are deliberately designed to include plausible yet incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge and careful analysis.


**3. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following pairs:**

   Issue                                             Action Taken
1.  Accreditation Deferred                           : GANHRI
2.  Recommendations for Addressing Lack of Diversity : Paris Principles
3.  Amendment to Protection of Human Rights Act, 2019 :  Increased NHRC Membership


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GANHRI (Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions) deferred the NHRC's accreditation. The 2019 amendment to the Protection of Human Rights Act did indeed increase the NHRC's membership. However, the recommendations for addressing the lack of diversity within the NHRC came from the GANHRI, not the Paris Principles.  The Paris Principles provide standards for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), but they do not directly issue specific recommendations for individual NHRIs like the NHRC. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the NHRC's functioning within the international framework of human rights and assesses their ability to differentiate between the roles of various organizations involved in the process.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Key Feature

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly bans the practice of manual scavenging.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, indeed recognizes 21 types of disabilities. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, establishes a National Council for Transgender Persons.  All three pairs are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of key social welfare legislation in India and their understanding of the specific provisions within these acts. The inclusion of all correct pairs as the answer option necessitates a thorough understanding of the subject matter and prevents guessing.

Environmental education is a key component across all stages of schooling.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of the NCF's structure and its emphasis on different aspects of education at various stages.  The correct answer encompassing all three pairs ensures that the candidate possesses a comprehensive understanding of the framework and its objectives.  The design of the question and answer options minimizes the possibility of correctly answering through mere guesswork.

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) indeed ranks countries based on their hunger levels. The Global Gender Gap Index measures gender equality across four key parameters. The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) tracks progress toward SDG 3.8.1, which focuses on universal health coverage.  All three pairs accurately reflect the core features of these indices/reports. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various global indices used to track social development and the ability to correctly associate these indices with their primary functions.  The options are designed to test in-depth knowledge, making superficial understanding insufficient for a correct answer.

1.  UNFPA                                         :  Achieving three zeros by 2030 (ending unmet need for family planning, preventable maternal deaths, and gender-based violence)
2.  WFP                                           : Bringing life-saving food to conflict-displaced and disaster-affected populations
3.  IFPRI                                          : Providing research-based policy solutions for poverty, hunger, and malnutrition reduction


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA's mandate directly includes the three zeros goal.  The WFP's core function is providing food assistance in emergency situations.  The IFPRI focuses on research to address issues of poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.  All three pairs correctly link the organizations with their primary mandates or areas of focus. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the roles and objectives of key international organizations working on development issues. The inclusion of all three correct pairs in the correct option necessitates a comprehensive understanding of these organizations and discourages simple guessing.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, comprehensively defines domestic violence, encompassing various forms of abuse.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013, mandates the establishment of ICCs within organizations.  The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, defines a child as anyone below 18 years old.  All three pairs correctly link the acts with their key provisions. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of Indian laws concerning women's protection, workplace safety, and juvenile justice.  The correct answer encompassing all three pairs ensures a thorough understanding of the key features of these crucial legislations and prevents guessing.

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, assessing gender equality across four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; Political Empowerment. The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), aiming to understand systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by women globally.  The UHC Service Coverage Index is a joint effort of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, tracking progress towards Universal Health Coverage. The Women’s Empowerment Index and the Global Gender Parity Index are both jointly produced by UN Women and UNDP, focusing on women's empowerment and gender equality relative to men, respectively. The International Labour Organization (ILO) is not associated with any of the listed indices. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to indices related to women's empowerment and gender equality, consider the following pairs:**

    Index                                             Dimension Measured
    1. Global Gender Gap Index                         :   Physical Integrity
    2. Gender Social Norms Index                      :   Political Empowerment
    3. Women’s Empowerment Index                      :   Economic Participation
    4. Global Gender Parity Index                       :   Educational Attainment


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index encompasses Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment.  The Gender Social Norms Index measures political, educational, economic, and physical integrity dimensions. The Women’s Empowerment Index focuses on women's power and freedoms to make choices and seize opportunities, encompassing elements of economic participation. The Global Gender Parity Index evaluates women's status relative to men across core human development dimensions, including educational attainment.  Therefore, only pairs 2 (Political Empowerment) and 4 (Educational Attainment) are correctly matched from the given options.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                    Report Released
    1. UNHCR                                         :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
    2. GANHRI                                        :   Accreditation Report on National Human Rights Commission
    3. UNPFII                                        :   Report on the 22nd Session of the UNPFII
    4. IFPRI                                          :   Global Food Policy Report 2023
    5. UNFPA                                         :   India Ageing Report 2023


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
    (d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) released the ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report.’ GANHRI (Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions) is known for its accreditation reports, including those on the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).  The UNPFII (UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues) holds annual sessions, and releases reports summarizing their proceedings. IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) published the Global Food Policy Report 2023. UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) released the India Ageing Report 2023. All the pairs provided are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the reports released by international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

    Report                                         Key Finding/Focus
    1. Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report:   Increase in food insecurity due to climate change
    2. Global Food Policy Report 2023              :   Forced migration due to social and climate crises
    3. India Ageing Report 2023                   :   India's population surpassing China's population
    4. SDG Progress Report 2023: Special Edition  :   High neonatal mortality rate in India due to inadequate WASH services


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’ highlights forced migration due to conflict, violence, and human rights violations, including the increase in displacement due to social and climate crises. The Global Food Policy Report 2023 focuses on food insecurity and its causes. The India Ageing Report 2023 indeed notes that India’s population is set to surpass China's. The SDG Progress Report 2023: Special Edition focuses on overall progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, not specifically on India’s neonatal mortality rate and WASH. While inadequate WASH services contribute to high neonatal mortality, that specific link isn't a primary focus of that particular report. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                         Key Provision/Feature
    1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :   Criminalizes marital rape
    2.  Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019  :   Provides for self-perception of gender identity
    3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:   Mandates the construction of community sanitary latrines
    4.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :   Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) Only two
    (d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provides civil remedies for domestic violence but does not explicitly criminalize marital rape. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, allows for self-perception of gender identity through a certificate of identity. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to prevent manual scavenging and mandates the construction and maintenance of community sanitary latrines. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, as amended, allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women and up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances, not for all women.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

    State                          Number of PVTGs
1.  Madhya Pradesh              :   13
2.  Odisha                        :   7
3.  Chhattisgarh                 :   5
4.  Andaman and Nicobar Islands :   2
5.  Mizoram                      :   1

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  Madhya Pradesh also has several PVTGs, but not 13.  Chhattisgarh has PVTGs, but the number is not 5.  Andaman and Nicobar Islands has 2 PVTGs. Mizoram has one PVTG. Therefore, only pair 4 and 5 are correctly matched. The other pairs contain incorrect numbers of PVTGs for the respective states.  Understanding the distribution of PVTGs across different states is crucial for targeted policy interventions and effective tribal welfare programs.  The question tests the candidate's factual recall and ability to identify the correct data from a set of plausible distractors.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                           State where it is listed as PVTG
1.  Bharia                          :   Bihar
2.  Kamar                           :   Karnataka
3.  Baiga                           :   Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh
4.  Hakki Pikki                     :   Odisha
5.  Konda Reddis                   :   Andhra Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh, not Bihar.  The Kamar tribe is a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, not Karnataka. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka, not Odisha. The Konda Reddis are a tribal group from Andhra Pradesh. Only the Baiga tribe is correctly matched as a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups designated as PVTGs.  Accurate knowledge of these classifications is important for implementing appropriate welfare schemes and recognizing the unique challenges faced by these communities.


**3. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

    Commission                     Recommendation
1.  Idate Commission                :   Establishment of a permanent commission for DNTs
2.  Renke Commission                :   Establishment of a national-level body for DNTs welfare
3.  National Commission for DNTs :   Preparation of a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Idate Commission recommended the establishment of a permanent commission for DNTs. The Renke Commission did not make a recommendation about establishing a national-level body for DNT welfare. The National Commission for DNTs is tasked with preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various commissions and their recommendations related to the welfare of DNTs.  Understanding these recommendations is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of government policies aimed at uplifting DNTs.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Disability                Provision
1. Intellectual Disability           :   4% reservation in government jobs
2. Acid Attack Victims              :   5% reservation in higher educational institutions
3. Benchmark Disability (40%+)    :   Right to free education (6-18 years)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates reservations for persons with disabilities in government jobs and higher educational institutions, but not specifically for intellectual disabilities or acid attack victims as separate categories.  The act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims under broader categories. However,  the right to free education (ages 6-18) is specifically associated with persons with benchmark disabilities (40% or more).  Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of specific provisions within the RPwD Act, 2016, highlighting the importance of knowing the details of legal frameworks related to disability rights.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act                                       Key Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Conversion of insanitary latrines into sanitary latrines
2.  The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 :  Punishment for employing manual scavengers
3.  The National Food Security Act, 2013  :  Rehabilitation of manual scavengers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines into sanitary latrines. This act also makes employing people as manual scavengers an offense, punishable by imprisonment and/or fine. The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, does not directly address manual scavenging. The National Food Security Act, 2013, focuses on food security and does not specifically cover the rehabilitation of manual scavengers. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the legal framework related to manual scavenging and its elimination, highlighting the importance of understanding the specific roles of different legislations in addressing this issue.  The inclusion of seemingly relevant but ultimately incorrect options makes this a challenging question.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                    State/Union Territory with PVTG Status
1. Bharia                                   :   Odisha
2. Kamar                                   :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
3. Baiga                                    :   Madhya Pradesh
4. Hakki Pikki                              :   Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, not Odisha.  The Kamar tribe is a PVTG in Chhattisgarh, not in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  The Baiga tribe is correctly listed as a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic tribal group in Karnataka.  Therefore, only the pairing of Baiga with Madhya Pradesh and Hakki Pikki with Karnataka is correct.  Option (c) accurately reflects this. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings of tribes and their PVTG status locations. The question tests factual recall regarding the geographical distribution of PVTGs in India, demanding precise knowledge about the states where specific tribes hold this designation.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs          :    Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology     :   Use of advanced farming techniques
2. Low level of literacy                     :    High literacy rates
3. Economic backwardness                  :    High per capita income
4. Declining or stagnant population        :    Rapid population growth

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs are the opposite of what's presented in the options. PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural technology (not advanced), low literacy rates (not high), economic backwardness (not high income), and declining or stagnant populations (not rapid growth).  The question tests the understanding of the characteristics used to define PVTGs, requiring the candidate to possess accurate knowledge of the criteria and to recognize the deliberate inversions in the options provided.  This makes it a difficult question due to the need for precise understanding and the presence of plausible, yet incorrect, distractors.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                               :   Key Feature
1.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                 :   Granted legal protection to nomadic tribes
2.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013  :  Permitted manual scavenging under specific conditions.
3.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:  Recognized only 10 types of disabilities.
4.  Forest Rights Act, 2006                    :   Denied habitat rights to PVTGs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was notorious for criminalizing entire tribal groups; it did not grant them protection. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act banned manual scavenging, not permitting it. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, recognized significantly more than 10 types of disabilities. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, grants habitat rights, not denies them, to certain tribal groups including PVTGs. The question tests factual knowledge of various acts and legislation related to vulnerable groups. The incorrect pairings act as effective distractors, making it challenging to identify the correct option (d).  The difficulty arises from requiring detailed knowledge of the specific provisions of different acts.


**4. With reference to the National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT), consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                             :   Implementing Ministry
1.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs:   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)   :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3.  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme                      :   Ministry of Rural Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs is implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is correctly attributed to the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme, focusing on hostels for DNTs, is also under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Rural Development. The question tests knowledge of government schemes and their implementing ministries, which requires precise recall of the administrative structure.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings increases the difficulty level, demanding detailed knowledge.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                               :    Provision
1.  MTP (Amendment) Act 2021                  :   Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women
2.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:   Mandates 7% reservation in government jobs for PwDs
3.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:  Defines a child as a person below 16 years of age

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women, not 24. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs, not 7%. The Juvenile Justice Act defines a child as a person below 18 years of age, not 16. The question tests the understanding of specific provisions within different acts and legislation.  The incorrect information in each pair acts as a strong distractor, requiring the candidate to possess precise knowledge of the legal frameworks. The difficulty stems from the need for accurate recall of numerical details and specific legal clauses.


**6. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   NEP 2020 Feature                          :   Target/Goal
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education    :   At least 30% by 2035
2.  Multiple exit options in Undergraduate degrees  :   Four-year duration only
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)        :   To limit research and innovation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The NEP 2020 aims for at least 50% GER in higher education by 2035, not 30%.  Undergraduate degrees under NEP offer multiple exit options, but they are not limited to a four-year duration; three-year options also exist. The NRF is intended to catalyze and expand research, not limit it.  The question tests knowledge of the NEP 2020 and its key features, requiring accurate recall of numerical targets and policy goals. The deliberate inaccuracies in the options make it a challenging question, demanding precise understanding of the policy's provisions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                               :   Key Publication/Report
1.  UNFPA                                      :   Global Food Policy Report
2.  IFPRI                                       :   State of World Population Report
3.  UNDESA                                    :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched.  The UNFPA releases the State of World Population Report, not the Global Food Policy Report. IFPRI publishes the Global Food Policy Report, not the State of World Population Report. UNDESA correctly releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report. The question tests knowledge of international organizations and their key publications, requiring precise association between the organization and its relevant report. The incorrect pairings provided as distractors significantly increase the difficulty level.  The question demands detailed knowledge of the work of these organizations.


**8. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   GHI Indicator                            :   Value in India (GHI 2023)
1.  Undernourishment                        :   20%
2.  Child Stunting                           :   30%
3.  Child Wasting                            :   15%
4.  Child Mortality                          :   4%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The values presented for the GHI indicators in India (2023) are not accurate.  The actual values differ from those provided in the options. The question assesses knowledge of the GHI and its indicators, specifically requiring recall of the numerical data for India.  The incorrect values in the options function as plausible distractors, making it a challenging question demanding precise recall of statistical data.  The difficulty level is high due to the need for accurate numerical recall.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                     State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                     :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                      :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                       :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all recognized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  However, the question plays on the fact that some PVTGs are spread across multiple states.  While the Baiga tribe is found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the question incorrectly places them in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a distractor. The Kamar tribe is correctly listed as a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh, but the question incorrectly assigns them to Chhattisgarh.  Therefore, only the pairing of Bharia PVTG with Chhattisgarh is entirely accurate.  The other options are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  Understanding the distribution of PVTGs across different states is crucial for comprehending the complexities of tribal welfare policies and their implementation.  The question tests the candidate's ability to discern accurate information from potentially misleading pairings.


**2. With reference to PVTGs in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs       Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology :   High level of literacy
2. Low level of literacy                 :   Significant economic advancement
3. Declining or stagnant population    :   High population growth rate
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs are designed to identify tribes with characteristics indicating vulnerability.  A pre-agricultural level of technology implies a low level of technological development, contrasting with the statement "high level of literacy".  Low literacy is a key characteristic of PVTGs, while "significant economic advancement" contradicts this.  A declining or stagnant population is a marker of vulnerability, opposite to "high population growth rate".  Therefore, none of the pairs accurately reflect the criteria for identifying PVTGs in India. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the precise criteria used to define PVTGs and their implications for policy interventions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nomadic Community                     Characteristic
1. Hakki Pikki Tribe                    :   Hunter/trapper community
2. Konda Reddis                        :   Semi-nomadic pastoralist group
3. Gujjars                              :   Peripatetic group of entertainers
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge of nomadic communities in India and their primary livelihoods. The Hakki Pikki are known as semi-nomadic groups, primarily involved in basket weaving and other crafts, not hunting or trapping.  Konda Reddis are indeed hunter-gatherer communities, contrasting with the description "semi-nomadic pastoralist group."  Gujjars are primarily pastoral communities, not entertainers, though some might engage in other occupations.  Thus, none of the given pairs accurately represent the characteristics of these nomadic groups.  This question highlights the diversity within nomadic communities and the need for nuanced understanding of their socio-economic realities.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                    Feature
1. Reservation in Government jobs       :   Minimum 5% reservation in higher educational institutions
2. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities :  Applicable to children aged 6-18 years
3. Special Courts for faster adjudication of cases :  Established in every district
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question tests detailed knowledge of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. While the Act mandates reservation for PwDs, the percentage in government jobs is 4%, not 5%, making option 1 incorrect in its pairing.  Free education for children with benchmark disabilities is correctly paired with the age range 6-18 years.  The establishment of special courts in every district for faster adjudication is also accurate.  The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question demands precise recall of the Act's provisions and highlights the importance of accurate information in understanding disability rights legislation.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                       Focus Area
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Prevention of insanitary latrines
2. Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) :   Provision of concessional loans
3. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                           :   Rehabilitation in alternative professions
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses knowledge of government initiatives aimed at eradicating manual scavenging. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act primarily focuses on preventing the practice, not directly on the demolition of insanitary latrines, although that is a related measure.  The SRMS scheme focuses on rehabilitation through alternative employment, not concessional loans, which are a feature of the Swachhta Udyami Yojana.  The Swachhta Udyami Yojana correctly pairs with providing concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the various components of the government's strategy to address manual scavenging.


**6. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Component                                 Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)                    :   Target of 50% by 2035 in higher education
2. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                 :   Digital storage of academic credits earned from various institutions
3. National Research Foundation (NRF)            :   Focus on school education reforms
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's understanding of the key components of the NEP 2020. The NEP 2020 sets a target of at least 50% GER in higher education by 2035, making pair 1 correctly matched. The ABC is designed to digitally store academic credits, making pair 2 correct. However, the NRF is focused on research and innovation at the higher education level, not school education reforms, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between various NEP provisions and their specific areas of focus.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                   Releasing Organization
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                       :   World Economic Forum
2. Global Gender Gap Index                         :   Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
3. Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI) :   World Health Organization and World Bank
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses knowledge of various global indices and their releasing organizations. The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Economic Forum.  The Global Gender Gap Index is published by the World Economic Forum, not Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The UHC Service Coverage Index is correctly paired with the WHO and World Bank. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate’s awareness of different global development indices and their sources.  The incorrect pairings act as strong distractors, testing the candidate’s precise knowledge.


**8. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Worker Category                     Key Role
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)          :   Focuses primarily on maternal and child health
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)    :   Provides early childhood care and development
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) :  Creates awareness on health-determining factors
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles played by different community health workers within the Anganwadi system.  AWWs are indeed involved in early childhood care and development, but their role extends to various aspects of child and maternal health, so the primary focus of ANMs on maternal and child health is incorrect. ANMs primarily focus on maternal and child health services, including immunizations, which is incorrect in this pairing. ASHAs play a crucial role in creating awareness about factors determining health status. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, requiring a detailed understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each worker category.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Institution  | Ranking Category
1. Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore | Top 10 Global Rankings
2. Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay | 501-600 Bracket in Times Higher Education Rankings
3. University of Delhi (DU)             | Top 10 in India in QS World University Rankings 2025
4. Anna University                         | Top 500 in QS World University Ranking 2024

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because only Anna University's placement in the 501-600 bracket in a global ranking is accurately reflected among the given pairs. Let's examine the other options:

* **Option (a):** IISc Bangalore did not achieve a top 10 global ranking in any of the major ranking systems mentioned in the provided text.  While it topped the list of Indian Universities in the Times Higher Education ranking (201-250 bracket), this doesn't equate to a top 10 global position.

* **Option (b):**  The University of Delhi's ranking in QS World University Rankings 2025 is not among the top 10 globally, but rather secured the seventh spot *among Indian universities*.  This is a significant difference.

* **Option (c):** IIT Bombay's placement is mentioned as 149th in QS World University Ranking 2024;  it's not within the 501-600 bracket.  While Anna University is correctly placed in the 501-600 bracket in the Times Higher Education Ranking 2024, the pairing is inaccurate as it doesn't precisely match the given data.


The question tests factual recall of specific ranking details from different ranking systems, demanding precise knowledge rather than general awareness of university rankings. The distractors are designed to be plausible for someone with a general understanding of Indian university rankings but lacking the precise details.



**2. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                                  Specific Target or Goal
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education | 50% by 2025
2. Multiple exit options in Undergraduate degrees |  Integration with National Credit Framework (NCrF)
3. Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) |  Attaining highest standards for multidisciplinary education
4. National Research Foundation (NRF)              |  Expansion of research and innovation across India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Options (d) is correct.  Let's analyze each pair:

* **Pair 1:** The NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, not 2025.  This is a crucial detail that distinguishes the correct answer from incorrect ones.

* **Pair 2:**  The multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees are indeed a key feature of NEP 2020, and these options are directly related to and facilitated by the National Credit Framework (NCrF).  This is a correct matching.

* **Pair 3:** The establishment of MERUs is accurately stated as aiming to achieve the highest standards for multidisciplinary education. This is also correct.

* **Pair 4:** The NRF's goal of catalyzing and expanding research and innovation across India is accurately described. This is correct.


The question tests the understanding of specific policy details within the NEP 2020.  The distractor in Pair 1 (incorrect year for GER target) is designed to catch those who have a general understanding of NEP 2020 but lack precise knowledge of the timelines involved.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Key Report or Publication
1. UNFPA                                      | Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2. UNDESA                                     | India Ageing Report 2023
3. UNHCR                                      | Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
4. IFPRI                                       | Global Food Policy Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because only the IFPRI's association with the Global Food Policy Report 2023 is accurate. Let's examine the inaccuracies in the other options:

* **Pair 1:** The UNFPA's key report is the State of World Population report, not the UNHCR's "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report".  The latter report is associated with the UNHCR.

* **Pair 2:** The UNDESA publishes numerous reports, but the India Ageing Report 2023 is specifically linked to the UNFPA (in collaboration with IIPS).

* **Pair 3:** The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023 is the work of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), not the UNHCR.

The question tests the knowledge of specific organizations and their associated publications.  The distractors involve swapping reports between organizations that operate in related fields, making them plausible but ultimately incorrect.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to correctly associate organizations with their specific publications.



**4. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for School Education System, consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                                   PGI Grade in 2021-22
1. Punjab                                      | Daksh
2. Chandigarh                                  | Prachesta-2
3. Arunachal Pradesh                          | Akanshi-3
4. Mizoram                                    | Utkarsh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Let's analyze the inaccuracies:

* **Pair 1:** Punjab achieved a Prachesta-2 grade, not the highest grade of Daksh.

* **Pair 2:** Chandigarh correctly received a Prachesta-2 grade.

* **Pair 3:** Arunachal Pradesh is correctly identified as being in the lowest grade of Akanshi-3.

* **Pair 4:** Mizoram was in Akanshi-3, not Utkarsh.


The question tests factual recall of specific PGI grades for different states/UTs in a particular year.  The distractors involve swapping grades between states/UTs with similar performance levels, making them plausible but incorrect.  The question assesses factual recall and attention to detail.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Provision or Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 |  Bans manual scavenging
2. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 |  Provides 4% reservation in Government jobs for PwDs but not applicable to police forces
3. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021         | Allows only altruistic surrogacy and penalizes commercial surrogacy
4. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 | Defines a child as a person below 16 years of age

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Let's examine why:

* **Pair 1:** The act explicitly prohibits employment as manual scavengers.

* **Pair 2:** The RPwD Act 2016 mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities, but this is correctly stated as not extending to police forces.

* **Pair 3:** The Surrogacy Act indeed allows only altruistic surrogacy and penalizes commercial practices.

* **Pair 4:** The JJ Act defines a child as a person below 18 years, not 16 years.  This is the incorrect pairing.


The question tests knowledge of specific acts and their key provisions. The distractor in Pair 4 uses a number close to the correct age, testing the examinee's precise understanding of the legal definition. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to identify key provisions of different social welfare legislation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Index                                      Releasing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index                 :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index              :   World Economic Forum
3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index : World Health Organization and World Bank
4. Path to Equal Report                     :   UN Women and UNDP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is indeed jointly released by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.  The other options are incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the UNDP, not the World Economic Forum.  Finally, the Path to Equal Report is a joint publication of UN Women and UNDP, as stated correctly in option (c). Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The question tests factual recall and understanding of international development indices and their respective releasing organizations.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, drawing on the general knowledge related to gender equality and global health initiatives, making the question challenging for candidates who might not have precise knowledge of each index's source.



**2. With reference to indices measuring women's empowerment and gender equality, consider the following pairs:**

Index                                    Focus
1. Women's Empowerment Index (WEI)       :   Evaluates the status of women relative to men
2. Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI)     :   Focuses solely on women, measuring their power and freedoms
3. Global Gender Gap Index                :   Measures gender parity across economic, educational, health, and political dimensions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) accurately focuses solely on women, measuring their power and freedoms to make choices and seize opportunities in life.  The Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) is designed to measure the status of women relative to men in core dimensions of human development, exposing gaps in parity. The Global Gender Gap Index encompasses a broader range of parameters than solely focusing on women's power and freedoms. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's ability to analyze and differentiate between nuanced concepts within the field of gender studies, requiring a clear understanding of the specific focus and scope of each index.  The distractors exploit the interconnectedness of these indices to create a challenging multiple-choice question.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                  Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                     :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2. UNDESA                                   :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3. UNHCR                                    :   State of World Population Report 2023
4. IFPRI                                     :   Global Food Policy Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) correctly released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) accurately released the Global Food Policy Report 2023.  The other pairs are mismatched.  The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) releases the State of World Population Report, not UNHCR. The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) publishes the Global Trends: Forced Displacement report.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests factual recall and the ability to link organizations with their specific publications and initiatives. The inclusion of plausible distractors, utilizing similar-sounding reports and organizations, increases the question's difficulty level.


**4. With reference to educational reforms in India, consider the following pairs:**

Reform/Initiative                                  Key Feature
1. National Credit Framework (NCrF)             :   Divides education into 8 levels, integrating school, higher, and vocational education credits.
2. Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education :   Classifies States/UTs and districts into ten grades based on UDISE+ data and NAS.
3. National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) :   Focuses solely on higher education reforms.
4. Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023 :   Establishes a fund to provide strategic direction for research and innovation.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Credit Framework (NCrF) accurately integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education. The Performance Grading Index (PGI) correctly classifies States/UTs and districts based on UDISE+ and NAS data. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, accurately establishes a fund for research and innovation. However, the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) is not solely focused on higher education reforms; it encompasses school education.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of recent educational reforms in India, demanding specific knowledge of their key features. The inclusion of a distractor (NCF-SE) that is partially true but not entirely accurate increases the difficulty of the question.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy                                       Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Bans manual scavenging and provides for rehabilitation.
2. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Mandates 5% reservation in government jobs for persons with disabilities.
3. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :   Defines domestic violence to include only physical and sexual abuse.
4. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy and penalizes commercial surrogacy.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act correctly bans manual scavenging and provides for rehabilitation. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act accurately mandates reservation in government jobs. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act correctly allows only altruistic surrogacy and penalizes commercial surrogacy. However, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act defines domestic violence more broadly than just physical and sexual abuse; it includes other forms of abuse.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of social welfare legislation in India, requiring precise understanding of the provisions of each act.  The distractor (option 3) is designed to be plausible, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the PWDVA.



**6.  With reference to tribal welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

Category/Group                                 Characteristic
1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :   Centrally recognized special categories from among Scheduled Tribes.
2. De-notified Tribes (DNTs)                   :   Communities notified as 'born criminal' during the British regime.
3. Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes           :   All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
4. Scheduled Tribes (STs)                     :  All PVTGs are included in this category.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs are indeed centrally recognized special categories within Scheduled Tribes. DNTs were indeed notified as 'born criminal' during British rule.  All PVTGs are a subset of Scheduled Tribes. However, the statement that all nomadic tribes are DNTs is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes fall under the DNT category. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the categorization and characteristics of various tribal groups in India, requiring a nuanced understanding of their distinctions.  The distractor (pair 3) is designed to be plausible, exploiting the overlapping nature of these tribal groups.




**1. With reference to Social Issues in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                     Key Feature
    1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy
    2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 :   Allows termination up to 20 weeks for all
    3. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013 :   Bans manual scavenging
    4. Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 :   Provides for self-perception of gender identity

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly legalizes only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, as amended, allows for the termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women based on the advice of one doctor. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, comprehensively bans the practice of manual scavenging.  Finally, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, a landmark legislation, allows transgender individuals to self-identify their gender and obtain a certificate of identity reflecting this self-identified gender. All four pairs are correctly matched, reflecting accurate and significant details of these crucial pieces of legislation concerning social issues in India.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**2. With reference to Vulnerable Sections in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Community/Group                         Specific Characteristic/Issue
    1. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)              :   Historically labelled as "criminal tribes"
    2. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :   Highest concentration in Odisha
    3. Manual Scavengers                     :   Rehabilitation efforts under SRMS scheme
    4. Children in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) :   Identification for adoption under Temple of Healing judgment

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Denotified Tribes (DNTs) were historically categorized as "criminal tribes" under British colonial rule, a legacy that continues to impact their social and economic standing.  Odisha houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India. The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) is a significant government initiative aimed at rehabilitating individuals engaged in this hazardous profession.  The Supreme Court's judgment in *Temple of Healing v. Union of India* highlighted the need to identify children in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) who are eligible for adoption.  Each pair accurately reflects a key characteristic or issue related to the respective vulnerable group.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the only correct option.



**3. With reference to Government Schemes related to Social Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Name                                   Focus Area

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) is a flagship skill development scheme that encompasses various skill training programs, including initiatives targeting marginalized communities such as transgender individuals. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) directly addresses child labour through rehabilitation and educational initiatives. The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) is a comprehensive program providing nutritional and healthcare services for children in the 0-6 age group. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), the rural sanitation program, is focused on achieving ODF status in villages across India.  All four pairs accurately represent the focus area of each scheme. Therefore, option (d) is the only correct option.



**4. With reference to Acts and Policies related to Women and Children, consider the following pairs:**

    Legislation/Policy                                  Specific Provision

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, defines a child as anyone below 18 years and sets the age of consent for sexual activity at 18. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, also defines a child as someone under 18.  The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, specifically addresses adoption within the Hindu community. The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, aims to reduce stigma and improve access to menstrual hygiene products and information.  Each pair accurately connects the legislation/policy with its key provision. Option (d) is thus the only correct option.



**5. With reference to Education Policies and Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy/Initiative                                  Key Feature

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 introduced a significant restructuring of the school education system, proposing a 5+3+3+4 structure based on age groups. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) is directly aligned with the NEP 2020's goals and recommendations. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to create a system where credits earned through various educational pathways – academic, vocational, and skill-based – are integrated and transferable.  The National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, established the NRF and subsumed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB). All four pairs correctly link the policy/initiative with its main feature. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.


**6. With reference to International Organizations and Reports, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Report                           Key Focus/Publication
    1.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)     :   India Ageing Report 2023
    2.  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
    3.  World Food Programme (WFP)                :   Global Report on Food Crisis

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).  The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) publishes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report. The World Food Programme (WFP) releases the Global Report on Food Crisis, and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) publishes the Global Food Policy Report.  All four pairs correctly match the organization/report with its key focus or publication.  Therefore, only option (d) is correct.


**7. With reference to Health Initiatives and Reports, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Report                               Key Element
    1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                      :   Universal Health Coverage
    2.  National Family Health Survey (NFHS)        :   Data on health indicators
    3.  Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI) :   Tracks SDG 3.8.1
    4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush           :   Immunization coverage

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a major initiative aimed at achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) is a large-scale survey that collects data on various health indicators across the country. The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI) specifically tracks progress towards SDG 3.8.1, which relates to UHC.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on improving immunization coverage, particularly among children and pregnant women.  All four pairs accurately reflect the key element associated with each initiative or report. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.


**8. With reference to Nutrition and Sanitation, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator/Program                                 Key Metric/Goal
    1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI)                     :   Measures hunger levels on a scale
    2.  Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status       :   Sustained ODF status with waste management
    3.  POSHAN Abhiyan                               :   Focuses on improving nutrition among children
    4.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM)             :   Reducing stunting in high-burden districts

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) uses a multidimensional index to measure and rank countries based on their hunger levels. Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status goes beyond the basic ODF criteria by incorporating solid and liquid waste management systems. POSHAN Abhiyan is a national program focusing on improving nutrition among pregnant women, mothers, and children. The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) aims to reduce stunting, particularly in districts with high malnutrition burdens.  Each pair accurately describes the key metric or goal associated with the given indicator or program. Option (d) is the correct answer because all four pairs are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                                    State/UT with PVTG Status
1. Bharia                                  :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Kamar                                   :   Chhattisgarh
3. Baiga                                   :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4. Hakki Pikki                             :   Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is correctly listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Madhya Pradesh.  Similarly, the Kamar and Baiga tribes are correctly identified as PVTGs in Chhattisgarh.  The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic tribal group residing primarily in Karnataka.  However, the Baiga tribe is not found in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; their presence is primarily concentrated in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair of Baiga and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings of Bharia with Madhya Pradesh, Kamar with Chhattisgarh, and Hakki Pikki with Karnataka.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of PVTGs and their geographical distribution across India, demanding precise recall of tribal group locations.


**2. With reference to Tribal welfare, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                                 Ministry
1.  Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission falls under the purview of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, focused on improving the lives of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups.  The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is indeed administered by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, aiming to uplift Denotified Tribes.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) also operates under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes the incorrectly matched pair of Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission. Option (b) incorrectly attributes the SEED scheme to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair of NCDNT and Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. Option (d) correctly identifies the ministries responsible for the Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission and the NCDNT. The question tests the understanding of the governmental structure related to tribal welfare and the allocation of responsibilities among different ministries, necessitating precise recall of governmental ministries and their associated schemes.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Category of Disability                       Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 Provision
1. Intellectual Disability                     :   Free education for children between 6 and 18 years
2. Acid Attack Victims                       :   Reservation in Government jobs (minimum 4%)
3.  Persons with Benchmark Disability        :   Recognized as one of the 21 types of disabilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, encompasses a broad range of provisions to protect and empower individuals with various disabilities. Intellectual disability is one of the 21 types of disabilities recognized under the Act, and children with benchmark disabilities (including intellectual disabilities) are entitled to free education between the ages of 6 and 18. Acid attack victims are explicitly included as a category of disability under the Act and are eligible for the mandated reservation in government jobs.  A "person with benchmark disability" is defined within the Act as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability, indicating its formal recognition. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the specific provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, requiring a detailed knowledge of the legislation and its coverage of various disabilities.


**4. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, consider the following pairs:**

    Offence                                    Penalty
1.  Employing someone to clean insanitary latrines :   Imprisonment up to 2 years or fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both
2. Constructing insanitary latrines              :   Demolition of insanitary latrines
3.  Employing someone to clean sewers without protective gear :   Rehabilitation through alternate employment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to eliminate manual scavenging and rehabilitate those engaged in it.  The act prescribes penalties for various offences related to manual scavenging. Employing someone to clean insanitary latrines is explicitly prohibited and carries a penalty of imprisonment up to two years, a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both.  The act mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines, not as a penalty for constructing them, but as a crucial step towards preventing manual scavenging.  Rehabilitation is a key component of the act, but it's not a penalty for employing someone without protective gear; rather, it's a provision for those who have been engaged in manual scavenging.  Therefore, only the first pair is correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the legal framework surrounding manual scavenging, requiring detailed understanding of the penalties stipulated in the act.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                   Source Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index                    :  United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index                 :  World Economic Forum
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)          :  World Health Organization and World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is published annually by the World Economic Forum, assessing gender equality across various dimensions. The Gender Social Norms Index is indeed released by the United Nations Development Programme, measuring societal norms related to gender. The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) is a joint initiative of the World Health Organization and the World Bank, tracking progress towards universal health coverage.  Therefore, only the third pair is correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's awareness of various global indices related to social development, requiring knowledge of the organizations responsible for their publication.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings acts as a significant distractor.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                     State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                     :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                     :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                      :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4.  Highest number of PVTGs       :   Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because Odisha houses the highest number (13) of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India.  The other pairs are incorrectly matched. The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making options 1, 2, and 3 incorrect in their pairings.  Andaman and Nicobar Islands has PVTGs, but not the Baiga tribe specifically. The question tests factual recall of the distribution of PVTGs across Indian states and union territories, demanding precise knowledge rather than general understanding.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as the partial correctness of statements 1, 2, and 3, increases the difficulty level and assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related but incorrect information.


**2. With reference to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs    :   Description
1.  Technology Level                 :   Post-agricultural
2.  Literacy Level                    :   High
3.  Economic Status                  :   Financially advanced
4. Population Trend                 :   Rapidly increasing

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural levels of technology, low literacy levels, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 present the opposite of the actual criteria, serving as strong distractors. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the specific criteria used to define PVTGs. The options are designed to be misleading, requiring careful attention to detail and accurate recall of the information.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nomadic/Semi-Nomadic Tribe       :    State/UT
1. Hakki Pikki Tribe                 :   Gujarat
2. Konda Reddis                      :   Karnataka
3. Chenchus                           :   Andhra Pradesh
4. Pardis                             :   Maharashtra

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1,2,3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka, not Gujarat.  While Pardis are a pastoral community, their primary location isn't solely Maharashtra.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of specific nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes in India. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options requires careful evaluation and precise knowledge of tribal groups and their locations.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following pairs:**

   Provision of RPwD Act                 :    Specific Detail
1. Minimum Reservation in Government Jobs   :   5%
2. Minimum Reservation in Higher Education  :   4%
3.  Types of Disabilities Recognized       :   10
4.  Age for Free Education                :   15 to 18 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The RPwD Act mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs and at least 5% reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions for persons with benchmark disabilities. The act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 10, and provides free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18 years.  This question tests knowledge of specific provisions within the RPwD Act, demanding precise information rather than a general understanding of the law. The incorrect options provide plausible but incorrect numbers and age ranges, thereby increasing the difficulty level.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                  :    Key Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013  :  Allows manual scavenging with protective gear.
2.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system:   Promotes 100% manual scavenging.
3. Swachhta Udyami Yojana       :    Provides free sanitation equipment.
4. NAMASTE scheme                 :   Joint initiative of MoSJE and MoHUA.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment, and the NAMASTE scheme is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Option 1 is incorrect because the Act prohibits manual scavenging; using protective gear is an exception, not a feature. Option 2 is incorrect as the National Policy promotes mechanization, aiming to eliminate manual scavenging.  This question tests knowledge of government schemes and legislation related to manual scavenging and sanitation. The carefully chosen distractors require a precise understanding of the nuances of each scheme and act.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of NCF-SE                :    Description
1.  Schooling Structure              :   4+3+3+4
2. Board Examinations               :   Students can take exams only once per year.
3. Language Proficiency             :   Students must be proficient in at least two Indian languages.
4. Vocational Education             :   Focuses solely on work with machines.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling and emphasizes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.  Option 2 is incorrect; the NCF-SE allows students to take board examinations on at least two occasions. Option 4 is also incorrect; vocational education under the NCF-SE encompasses diverse areas of work, not just work with machines. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the key features of the NCF-SE, requiring precise knowledge of the framework's components.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar but incorrect details.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution          :    Key Function/Report
1. UNFPA                             :   Releases the Global Hunger Index report.
2. UNDESA                           :   Monitors implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.
3. UNCRC                            :  Issues guidance on children's right to a clean environment.
4. IFPRI                             :   Focuses solely on refugee issues.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. UNDESA releases the Sustainable Development Goals report, and UNCRC focuses on children's rights, including environmental rights.  UNFPA does not release the Global Hunger Index report; that is the responsibility of IFPRI. IFPRI is not solely focused on refugee issues; it deals with broader food policy research. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various international organizations and their roles.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to accurately associate organizations with their specific mandates and publications.  The inclusion of an organization with a very similar but ultimately different function (IFPRI vs. WFP) adds to the question's difficulty.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

    State                                  Number of PVTGs
1. Odisha                               : 15
2. Madhya Pradesh                       : 13
3. Chhattisgarh                           : 11
4. Andhra Pradesh                        : 9
5. Jharkhand                             : 7

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided text states that Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India (13), not 15 as stated in option 1. Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are mentioned to have PVTGs, but the exact number is not specified as 13 and 11 respectively. Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand are also mentioned as states with PVTGs, although the numbers given in the options are not accurate.  Therefore, only option (d) reflects the accurate information available concerning the number of PVTGs in Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand, although the specific count for these states is not explicitly detailed in the provided text.  The question tests factual recall and requires careful analysis of the provided information to avoid being misled by inaccurate distractor options.  It is important to note that the precise number of PVTGs in each state might vary based on different sources and updates, highlighting the need for precise data verification in such questions.


**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Commission                        Feature
1. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871            :  Repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
2. Renke Commission, 2008             : Estimated 198 DNTs
3. Idate Commission report              : Recommended a permanent commission for DNTs
4. National Commission for DNTs         : Prepared a state-wise list of DNTs
5. SEED Scheme                          : Provides health insurance to all DNT families

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. The Renke Commission of 2008 estimated the number of DNTs, and the Idate Commission recommended a permanent commission for DNTs. The National Commission for DNTs was tasked with preparing a state-wise list.  However, the SEED scheme does not provide health insurance to *all* DNT families, but rather to a portion as part of a broader economic empowerment plan.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are completely accurate. This question tests factual recall and the ability to discern subtle inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements.  The inclusion of the SEED scheme as a distractor highlights the need to carefully assess each statement's accuracy based on the provided information.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision                                   Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs        :  Not less than 4%
2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions: Not less than 5%
3.  Definition of “Person with benchmark disability”: Not less than 30% specified disability
4.  Free education                          : For children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18 years
5.  Exemption from Reservation           : Police forces

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and 5% in higher educational institutions for persons with disabilities.  The act also exempts police forces from these reservation provisions.  However, the definition of "Person with benchmark disability" specifies at least 40%, not 30%, of a specified disability. While free education is provided, the other options contain inaccuracies in their descriptions of the act's provisions.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle differences in numerical data, crucial for accurate interpretation of legal provisions.  The inclusion of the incorrect percentage for the "benchmark disability" definition serves as a significant distractor.


**4.  With reference to Manual Scavenging, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                                     Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013 : Bans manual scavenging
2. National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem  : Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning
3. NAMASTE scheme                                   : Joint initiative of MoHUA and Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
4. Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) : Provides concessional loans
5. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                          : Rehabilitates manual scavengers in alternative professions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, explicitly bans manual scavenging. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem directly aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices associated with manual scavenging. The NAMASTE scheme is indeed a joint initiative of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) and the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  However, the Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) focuses on rehabilitation through alternative employment, not concessional loans (that is a feature of Swachhta Udyami Yojana). Similarly, Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans, not rehabilitation into alternative professions (that's the role of SRMS).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests factual recall and understanding of government schemes aimed at eradicating manual scavenging. The carefully chosen distractors test the ability to distinguish between similar-sounding schemes and their specific functions.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision                                    Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target      : At least 50% by 2035 in Higher Education
2. Undergraduate degree duration             : 3 or 4 years with multiple exit options
3. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)           : Stores academic credits earned from various institutions
4. National Research Foundation (NRF)        : Catalyzes research and innovation
5. National Educational Technology Forum (NETF): Focuses primarily on school education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 sets a GER target of at least 50% by 2035 for higher education.  It introduces 3 or 4-year undergraduate degrees with multiple exit options. The ABC is designed to digitally store academic credits. The NRF is established to boost research and innovation.  However, the NETF is not limited to school education; it encompasses both school and higher education.  Therefore, all pairs except pair 5 are correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of the NEP 2020's key provisions and the ability to distinguish between the scope and functions of different initiatives under the policy.  The distractor regarding the NETF's scope highlights the importance of precise understanding of policy details.


**6. With reference to Organizations in News, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Report/Function
1. UNFPA                                      :  India Ageing Report 2023
2. UNDESA                                     : Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3. UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD) : Monitors implementation of ICPD Programme of Action
4. UN Committee on Rights of the Child (UNCRC) : Issued guidance on children’s right to a clean environment
5. World Food Programme (WFP)                :  Global Report on Food Crisis


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA released the India Ageing Report 2023. UNDESA released the SDG Progress Report 2023. The UNCPD monitors the implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action. The UNCRC issued guidance on children's right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. The WFP publishes the Global Report on Food Crisis.  All the pairs provided are correctly matched. This question assesses factual recall of various international organizations, their functions, and publications. The comprehensive nature of the question and the lack of distractors makes it a test of pure factual knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Educational Initiative                       Associated Ministry
1. Saksham Anganwadis                     : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2. National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN)      : Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  National Digital Education Architecture  : Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Saksham Anganwadis initiative falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, focusing on strengthening and upgrading Anganwadi Centres.  The National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) is also directly under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, aiming to improve nutrition levels among women and children.  However, the National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) is a collaborative project between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. While MeitY plays a crucial role in the technical aspects of NDEAR,  the primary responsibility for its implementation and policy lies with the Ministry of Education. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                   Key Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Focuses primarily on skill development and sports for PwDs
2. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :  Mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines
3. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021          : Allows only altruistic surrogacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, centers on eliminating manual scavenging and rehabilitating those involved. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, addresses the rights and inclusion of persons with disabilities, including provisions for reservation and education.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, legalizes only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy. Therefore, only pair 3 accurately reflects the key feature of the respective Act/Policy. Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly link features to the wrong Acts.


**3. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

    Educational Emphasis                     Stage of Schooling
1.  Separate subject of Environmental Education : Foundational Stage (Ages 3-8)
2.  Emphasis on capacities for scientific inquiry : Secondary Stage (Ages 14-18)
3.  Multilingualism and Indian Languages      : Preparatory Stage (Ages 8-11)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE emphasizes capacities for scientific inquiry at all stages, but it's particularly highlighted for the Secondary Stage (ages 14-18). Environmental education culminates as a separate subject in the Secondary Stage, not the Foundational Stage.  While multilingualism is encouraged throughout, it isn't solely focused on the Preparatory Stage.  Therefore, only pair 2 accurately reflects the NCF-SE's emphasis and the corresponding stage of schooling.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Key Report/Publication
1.  UNFPA                                      : Global Food Policy Report
2.  IFPRI                                       : State of World Population Report
3.  World Health Organization (WHO)             : Burden of disease attributable to unsafe WASH

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) publishes the State of World Population Report, focusing on population trends and reproductive health. IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) releases the Global Food Policy Report, analyzing food security and policy solutions.  The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes various reports, including one on the burden of disease attributable to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Therefore, only pair 3 correctly matches the organization to its key publication.



**5. With reference to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following pairs:**

    Framework/Index                            Key Feature
1.  Global Indicator Framework (GIF)          : Includes 284 indicators tailored to India's specific needs.
2.  NIF (National Indicator Framework)        : Framed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators.
3.  State Indicator Framework (SIF)           : Developed and circulated by Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation to States/UTs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) is a global framework with 248 indicators; the NIF includes 284 indicators, including those tailored to India's needs.  The GIF is framed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators, not the NIF.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) developed and circulated guidelines for the State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs) to States/UTs.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Initiative               Primary Focus Area
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                   :  Improving WASH services
2.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush          :  Increasing vaccination coverage
3.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)          :  Achieving Universal Health Coverage

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a health insurance scheme, not primarily focused on WASH.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush aims to improve vaccination rates, particularly among children and pregnant women.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) focuses on sanitation and hygiene in rural areas, not directly on achieving Universal Health Coverage. Thus, only pair 2 correctly links the scheme to its main focus.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribal Group                                 State with Highest PVTG Population
1.  Bharia                                      : Odisha
2.  Baiga                                       : Madhya Pradesh
3.  Kamar                                       : Chhattisgarh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Odisha has the highest number (13) of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). While Bharia, Baiga, and Kamar are all PVTGs,  Madhya Pradesh has a significant population of Baiga,  making pair 2 correct.  The highest number of any PVTG is not concentrated in a single state, and the distribution is diverse across different states.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Regulation                                  Governing Body
1.  National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019 :  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)
2.  National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023 : National Medical Commission (NMC)
3.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :  National Commission for Women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, is governed by the NMC itself, not NCPCR. The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023, is governed by the NNMC, not NMC. The Juvenile Justice Act is managed by Juvenile Justice Boards and Child Welfare Committees, not the National Commission for Women.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.




**1. With reference to Child Labour in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme/Initiative                     Ministry/Organization
1. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 : Ministry of Women and Child Development
2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme  : Ministry of Labour and Employment
3. PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal :  Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
4. Bachpan Bachao Andolan                    : International Labour Organization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Labour and Employment,  not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  The Ministry of Labour and Employment is primarily responsible for labor laws and regulations in India, including those related to child labor.  The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme is indeed a Central Sector scheme under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, focusing on the rehabilitation of child laborers.  The PENCiL portal is also managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, aiding in the rescue and rehabilitation of child labor victims.  Bachpan Bachao Andolan is an NGO, not an arm of the ILO. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly associate various acts and initiatives with the wrong ministries or organizations.


**2. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment/Feature                        Specific Detail
1.  Adoption process                         :  Finalized by District Magistrates
2.  Appeals against adoption orders        :  Heard by the Divisional Commissioner
3.  "Serious Offences" definition (post-2021 amendment) :  Includes offences with a minimum punishment of seven years imprisonment.
4.  Heinous Offences (pre-2021)            :  Tried exclusively in designated Juvenile Justice Courts.



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 2021 amendment to the Juvenile Justice Act did indeed grant District Magistrates the power to issue adoption orders, making pair 1 correct. Similarly, the amendment established the Divisional Commissioner as the appellate authority for adoption orders, making pair 2 correct. The post-2021 amendment redefined "serious offences," aligning with Supreme Court recommendations and specifying a maximum imprisonment term over seven years, but not necessarily a minimum of seven years, making pair 3 correct.  However,  pre-2021, the Act stipulated that offences punishable with imprisonment of more than seven years were tried in Children's Courts, but not exclusively; magistrates could also be involved depending on the specific details of the case making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision/Feature                       Specific Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs         :  Minimum of 4% reservation, applicable to all government services including police forces.
2.  Definition of "Person with benchmark disability"   :  A person with at least 40% of a specified disability.
3.  Accessibility of Government Offices      : Mandates relocation to ground floors or accessible locations only for offices in non-accessible buildings.
4. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities:  Applies to children between the ages of 6 and 18, with a choice of neighborhood or special schools.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, does indeed mandate a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with disabilities. However, this reservation does *not* apply to police forces (including Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, and Delhi Police). The act defines a "person with benchmark disability" as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability, making pair 2 correct. The act also mandates that government offices in inaccessible buildings relocate services to ground floors or accessible locations within the same facility, making pair 3 correct.  Free education for children with benchmark disabilities between 6 and 18 years is also a provision of the Act, with a choice of school type, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its amendments, consider the following pairs:**

  Rule/Provision                                    Specific Detail
1.  Use of donor gametes                       :  Allowed only if the intending couple has a medical condition requiring it, and at least one gamete is from the couple.
2.  Surrogacy for single women                 :   Permitted using self-eggs and donor sperm.
3.  Number of surrogacy attempts per surrogate mother  :   Limited to a maximum of 5 attempts.
4.  National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB):   Reviews and monitors implementation of the Act.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, allow the use of donor gametes under specific medical conditions for intending couples, with the stipulation that at least one gamete must be from the couple.  Single women (widows or divorcees) are allowed to undergo surrogacy using their own eggs and donor sperm.  The NARTSB is indeed responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Act's implementation. However, the number of surrogacy attempts allowed per surrogate mother is limited to 3, not 5, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Goal/Feature                        Specific Detail/Initiative
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target       :   At least 70% by 2035.
2.  Undergraduate degree structure           :   Offers multiple exit options, including certificates, diplomas, and honours degrees.
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)       :   Established to promote research and innovation in higher education.
4.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)           :  A digital platform for storing academic credits earned from various institutions.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50%, not 70%, by 2035, making pair 1 incorrect.  The policy does introduce multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees, including certificates, diplomas, and honours degrees, making pair 2 correct.  The NRF is established under NEP 2020 to boost research and innovation, making pair 3 correct.  The ABC is indeed a key feature of NEP 2020, designed to digitally store academic credits, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**6.  With reference to Manual Scavenging in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                    Specific Provision/Focus
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines.
2.  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) : Provides financial assistance for purchasing property.
3.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system : Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning and ensure the safety and dignity of sanitation workers.
4. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                    : Offers concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly prohibits the employment of manual scavengers and criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines. The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) aims to rehabilitate manual scavengers by providing them with alternative employment opportunities and financial assistance, including help with purchasing property. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system focuses on eliminating hazardous cleaning practices, thereby ensuring the safety and dignity of sanitation workers. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana offers concessional loans to individuals to purchase sanitation-related equipment. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to Menstrual Hygiene in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Initiative                           Specific Feature
1. Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023 :  Prioritizes underserved and vulnerable populations.
2.  Spain's Menstrual Leave Policy            : Grants paid menstrual leave to workers.
3.  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare    : Responsible for the implementation of the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023.



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, explicitly focuses on ensuring equitable access to menstrual hygiene resources, prioritizing underserved and vulnerable populations. Spain has indeed implemented a policy granting paid menstrual leave to its workers. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for releasing and implementing the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to Sexual Harassment at the Workplace in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Mechanism                             Specific Feature/Power
1. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) : Based on Vishaka Guidelines.
2. Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)       :  Has powers similar to those of a civil court.
3. Local Committee                           :  Deals with complaints from organizations with fewer than 10 employees.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act, 2013, is indeed based on the Vishaka Guidelines established by the Supreme Court in 1997.  The ICC, as mandated by the POSH Act, possesses powers similar to those of a civil court to investigate and address complaints of sexual harassment.  Local Committees are established to handle complaints from smaller organizations (less than 10 employees) or when the complaint is against the employer itself. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Category/Initiative                      Specific Detail
1.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :  First recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
2.  PM JANMAN (PM- Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan) :  Focuses on saturating PVTG households with basic facilities.
3.  Odisha                                   : Houses the highest number of PVTGs in India.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs were initially identified in 1973 as PTGs, based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission.  PM JANMAN is designed to provide basic facilities to PVTG households and habitations. Odisha indeed houses the highest number of PVTGs. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Report                    Specific Feature/Finding
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023        :  India ranked 101st.
2.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) India Ageing Report, 2023:  Collaborated with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).
3.  World Food Programme (WFP) Global Report on Food Crisis : Focuses on the impact of climate change on food security.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2023 ranked India at 111th, not 101st, making pair 1 incorrect. The UNFPA India Ageing Report 2023 was indeed prepared in collaboration with IIPS.  The WFP Global Report on Food Crisis does address the impact of climate change on global food security. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                     Number of PVTGs
1. Madhya Pradesh           13
2. Odisha                    7
3. Chhattisgarh              5
4. Andaman and Nicobar Islands 2

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because only the pair related to Andaman and Nicobar Islands having 2 PVTGs is correctly matched.  Madhya Pradesh has more than 13 PVTGs, and Odisha has more than 7 PVTGs; Chhattisgarh also houses more than 5 PVTGs. The text explicitly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India, indicating a significant discrepancy in the provided figures for Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. The number of PVTGs in Chhattisgarh is also understated.  Therefore, only the information regarding Andaman and Nicobar Islands is accurate among the given options.  The other options incorrectly present data on the number of PVTGs in various states.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in presented data.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                       State where granted Habitat Rights
1. Bharia                     Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar                      Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga                       Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only the Bharia tribe in Chhattisgarh was granted Habitat Rights.  The text explicitly mentions that Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes were granted Habitat Rights, but it specifies Bharia in Madhya Pradesh and Kamar and Baiga in Chhattisgarh.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include Kamar and Baiga in states where they were not specifically mentioned as receiving Habitat Rights. This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct pieces of information.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                      Ministry
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013  : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system     : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) : Ministry of Labour and Employment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment's purview. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, is not directly related to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs; its implementation involves multiple ministries. The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is administered by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Labour and Employment. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the government ministries' responsibilities.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                        Year of Enactment/Launch
1.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016   : 1995
2.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) : 2006
3.  The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                : 1952

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act was enacted in 2016, not 1995. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes was established later than 2006. The Criminal Tribes Act was repealed in 1952, not enacted in that year. This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify incorrect information based on established timelines.


**5. With reference to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for identifying PVTGs                     Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology           : High level of literacy
2. Low level of literacy                          :  High level of economic development
3. Declining or stagnant population               : Increasing population growth rate

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  All the provided descriptions contradict the actual criteria for identifying PVTGs.  PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  The question uses reverse logic and incorrect descriptions to test the candidate's knowledge of the PVTG identification criteria.


**6. With reference to the  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Emphasis Area                    Description
1. Science Education                 : Focuses solely on theoretical knowledge
2. Environmental Education           : Introduced only at the secondary level
3. Capacities for Scientific Inquiry  :  Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only option (c) is correct. The NCF-SE emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry, including critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Science education is not limited to theoretical knowledge; it incorporates practical application and experimentation. Environmental education is integrated throughout the schooling system, not limited to the secondary level.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the key principles of the NCF-SE.


**7.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                           Headquarters
1. UNFPA                                  Geneva
2. UNDESA                                 New York
3. GANHRI                                 Washington D.C.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct.  The UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) is headquartered in New York.  UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) is headquartered in New York, not Geneva. GANHRI (Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions) is headquartered in Geneva, not Washington D.C.  This question tests factual recall of the locations of various international organizations.


**8. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                        Value in India (GHI 2023)
1. Undernourishment                 : 18.7%
2. Child Stunting                     : 35.5%
3. Child Wasting                       : 16.6%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct. The GHI 2023 report indicates that Child Stunting in India was 35.5%. The values for undernourishment and child wasting are incorrectly assigned in the other options.  This question tests the ability to recall specific numerical data from a report.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                      Ministry
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana             : Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush  : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
3.  Saksham Anganwadis                : Ministry of Labour and Employment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct. Intensified Mission Indradhanush falls under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Ayushman Bharat Yojana is not under the Ministry of Women and Child Development; it's primarily under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Saksham Anganwadis is a program under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Labour and Employment.  This question assesses the understanding of the ministries responsible for various health and welfare schemes.


**10. With reference to the  National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   Level                                    Description
1. Levels 1-4                               : Higher Education
2. Levels 4.5-8                             : Vocational Education & Training
3.  Concept of Notional Learning Hours    :  Total learning hours fixed at 1000 hours/year

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Levels 1-4 in NCrF refer to school education, not higher education. Levels 4.5-8 refer to higher education, not vocational education and training. The total notional learning hours are 1200 hours/year, not 1000.  This question tests detailed knowledge of the NCrF structure and its components.


**1. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   NEP 2020 Provision                                       Specific Target/Goal
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education       :   Reach 100% by 2030
2. Multiple exit options in Undergraduate degrees          :   Offer certifications, diplomas, and honours degrees
3. Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) :   Improve the quality of research institutions
4. National Research Foundation (NRF)                     :   Boost international collaborations in education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to at least 50% by 2035, not 100% by 2030, making statement 1 incorrect.  The policy does indeed advocate for multiple exit options in undergraduate programs, allowing students to earn certifications, diplomas, and bachelor's degrees after completing one, two, or three years of study respectively.  The establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) is a key component of the NEP 2020 to improve the quality of multidisciplinary education and research. The National Research Foundation (NRF) is intended to catalyze research and innovation, but the primary focus is on domestic expansion rather than solely on international collaborations, therefore, statement 4 is partially correct, but not fully accurate. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3 and 4 are correctly matched.



**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

   PGI Aspect                                     Specific Characteristic/Outcome
1. PGI 2.0 (2021-22)                               :   All States/UTs achieved the highest grade (Daksh)
2.  Data Sources for PGI and PGI-D               :   National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021 data only
3.  PGI-D Report                                   :   Focuses exclusively on teacher training methodologies
4. Lowest Grade in PGI 2.0                         :   Assigned to Punjab and Chandigarh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

In the PGI 2.0 assessment for 2021-22, no States/UTs achieved the highest grade (Daksh), making statement 1 incorrect. The PGI and PGI-D indices utilize data from both the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) 2021-22 and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021, refuting statement 2. The PGI-D report focuses on various aspects of school education, including outcomes, effective classroom transactions, and school safety, but not exclusively on teacher training, thus statement 3 is false.  Finally, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram were placed in the lowest grade (Akanshi-3) in PGI 2.0, while Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade attained, which is Prachesta-2, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the  Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBU) regulations, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation Aspect                                      Specific Change/Provision
1. Age Requirement for Institutions Applying for DTBU Status :   Minimum 20 years of existence is required
2. Sponsoring Body for DTBU                          :   Only single sponsoring body allowed
3.  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)                     :   Mandatory creation of ABC identities for students
4. New Courses and Programs                            :   Institutions can start new courses without prior approval

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The new regulations allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DTBU status, contradicting statement 1. The regulations permit a cluster of institutions managed by more than one sponsoring body to apply for DTBU status, making statement 2 incorrect.  The new regulations mandate the creation of Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for students, making statement 3 correct.  Institutions can start new courses or programs only with the prior approval of their Executive Council and relevant statutory councils, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.



**4. With reference to the  Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India regulations, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation Aspect                                       Specific Provision/Requirement
1.  Approval for Establishment                         :   UGC approval is not required for establishment
2. Eligibility for FHEIs                                  :   Ranked within top 1000 globally 
3. Programmes Offered                                    :   Online and distance learning modes are permitted
4.  Financial Donations                                   :   Prior permission from Central Government required for foreign donations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

FHEIs require UGC approval before establishing Indian campuses, offering programs, or discontinuing courses, making statement 1 incorrect. The eligibility criterion specifies that FHEIs must be ranked within the top 500 globally (overall or subject-wise), making statement 2 incorrect.  The regulations explicitly prohibit FHEIs from offering programs in online or open and distance learning modes, contradicting statement 3.  The regulations do require prior permission from the Central Government for receiving donations from foreign sources, making statement 4 correct. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   NCrF Aspect                                           Specific Feature/Component
1.  Levels of Education Included                       :   Excludes Vocational Education and Training
2.  Credit Accumulation and Transfer                    :   Limited to Higher Education only
3.  Integration of Qualification Frameworks             :   Does not encompass the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
4.  Notional Learning Hours                           :  Fixed at 1000 Hours/Year


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF integrates credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education, making statement 1 incorrect.  The framework facilitates credit accumulation and transfer across all three educational sectors, not just higher education, thus statement 2 is incorrect. The NCrF explicitly aims to integrate the NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF, refuting statement 3. The total notional learning hours are fixed at 1200 hours/year, not 1000, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs related to Tribal Welfare in India:**

   Tribal Group/Initiative                                 Specific Characteristic/Feature
1.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)      :   Concentrated primarily in Southern India
2.  Odisha                                             :   Houses the lowest number of PVTGs in India
3.  Criteria for identifying PVTGs                      :   High levels of literacy are a key criterion
4.  Ministry responsible for Tribal Welfare              :   Ministry of Rural Development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs are spread across 18 states and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, not concentrated primarily in the South, making statement 1 incorrect. Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs, not the lowest, thus statement 2 is false. Low levels of literacy, not high levels, are a criterion for identifying PVTGs, making statement 3 incorrect. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs, not the Ministry of Rural Development, is responsible for tribal welfare, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the De-notified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   DNT Aspect                                          Specific Characteristic/Feature
1.  Origin of the term 'Denotified Tribes'              :   Post-independence legislation
2.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                          :   Still in effect
3.  Renke Commission (2008)                           :   Estimated less than 10 crore DNT population
4.  National Commission for DNTs                        :   Focuses solely on economic empowerment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The term 'Denotified Tribes' originates from the British regime's Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, not post-independence legislation, making statement 1 incorrect. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, thus statement 2 is false. The Renke Commission (2008) estimated nearly 15 crore Indians as belonging to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs, making statement 3 incorrect.  The National Commission for DNTs has a broader mandate than solely economic empowerment, including social and educational aspects, therefore, statement 4 is also false. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   PwD Related Aspect                                    Specific Provision/Feature
1.  Office of Chief Commissioner of PwDs                :   Established under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) :   Reservation for PwDs in police forces is mandated
3.  Landmark Judgments by Office of Chief Commissioner :   Mandated relocation of all government offices to accessible locations.
4.  Definition of "Person with benchmark disability"   :   Less than 40% of specified disability


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Office of Chief Commissioner of PwDs was indeed set up under the RPwD Act, 2016, making statement 1 correct. The RPwD Act does *not* mandate reservation for PwDs in police forces, making statement 2 incorrect. While the court emphasized accessibility for Divyangjan, it did not mandate relocation of *all* government offices to accessible locations, making statement 3 incorrect. A "Person with benchmark disability" is defined as having at least 40% of a specified disability, not less than 40%, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**9. With reference to Manual Scavenging in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Manual Scavenging Related Aspect                       Specific Feature/Provision
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013 :   Allows for the employment of manual scavengers under certain conditions.
2.  Punishment for Manual Scavenging Violations           :   Maximum imprisonment of 5 years
3.  Responsibility for Identifying Manual Scavengers       :   Solely rests with the Central Government
4.  National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem    :   Focuses only on urban areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, prohibits the employment of manual scavengers, making statement 1 incorrect. The maximum punishment is 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine of ₹1 lakh, not 5 years, making statement 2 incorrect.  Local authorities (municipalities or panchayats), cantonment boards, and railway authorities are responsible for identifying manual scavengers, not solely the Central Government, making statement 3 incorrect. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate manual scavenging across both rural and urban areas, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**10.  With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

    GHI Aspect                                      Specific Feature/Finding
1.  GHI 2023 Ranking of India                        :    Ranked among the top 25 countries
2.  Data Sources for GHI                             :    Primarily relies on data from the World Bank
3.  India's GHI Score (2023)                          :    Improved significantly compared to 2015
4.  Regions with Highest Hunger Levels (GHI 2023)     :    North America and Western Europe


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India was ranked 111th out of 125 countries in the GHI 2023, not among the top 25, making statement 1 incorrect. The GHI uses multiple data sources, including the FAO, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO, not solely the World Bank, making statement 2 incorrect.  India's GHI score showed a slight improvement from 29.2 in 2015 to 28.7 in 2023, which is not a significant improvement, thus statement 3 is false. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa had the highest hunger levels in GHI 2023, not North America and Western Europe, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State
1. Bharia PVTG                             :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                              :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                               :   Odisha
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). However, the question plays on the fact that some PVTGs are spread across multiple states.  Bharia and Baiga are found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, while Kamar is found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched, reflecting the presence of Bharia and Kamar PVTGs in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh respectively. Odisha is not listed as a state where these specific PVTGs reside. Option (a) is incorrect because only one pair is not correct. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes pair 3 which is wrong. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 3.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to analyze the distribution of tribal groups across states.


**2. With reference to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for identifying PVTGs           :  Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology     :   Use of advanced irrigation techniques
2. Low level of literacy                      :   Literacy rate above the national average
3. Economic backwardness                   :   High per capita income
4. Declining or stagnant population          :   Rapid population growth
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the given pairs are incorrectly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs include a pre-agricultural level of technology (meaning a reliance on traditional methods, not advanced ones), low literacy rates (below the national average), economic backwardness (low per capita income), and a declining or stagnant population (not rapid growth).  Each option presents at least one incorrect pairing, making (d) the only correct answer. This question tests factual recall and assesses the understanding of the criteria used to define PVTGs.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring careful consideration of each criterion.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      Characteristic
1. Hakki Pikki                             :   Hunter-gatherer community
2. Konda Reddis                           :   Semi-nomadic pastoralist community
3. Pardis                                  :   Peripatetic group of entertainers
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Hakki Pikki are a semi-nomadic tribal group, not hunter-gatherers.  Konda Reddis are hunter-gatherer communities, not pastoralists. The Pardis are indeed a peripatetic group often involved in entertainment. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific tribal groups and their characteristics, requiring precise factual recall. The incorrect options offer plausible but ultimately inaccurate associations.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Disability                         :  Reservation in Government Jobs
1. Intellectual Disability                  :   4%
2. Acid Attack Victims                      :   Not applicable
3. Visual Impairment                       :   4%
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities. While intellectual disability and visual impairment fall under this category, the reservation is not applicable to police forces, which is where this question gains its difficulty.  Acid attack victims are recognized as a type of disability under the Act, but the 4% reservation isn't universally applicable to all recognized disabilities. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the specific applicability of the 4% reservation.  This question tests knowledge of the Act's provisions, specifically regarding reservations and the exceptions to its application.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                               :  Ministry/Organization
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme          : Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
3.  Swachhta Udyami Yojana                    :  World Health Organization
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The NAMASTE scheme is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  The Swachhta Udyami Yojana is a government initiative, not associated with the World Health Organization.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 3. This question tests the knowledge of government schemes and their associated ministries, requiring accurate recall of the administrative bodies responsible for implementing these initiatives.


**6. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                               :   Target Year
1.  Increase GER in Higher Education to 50%    :   2030
2.  Increase Public Investment in Education to 6% of GDP  :   2035
3.  Achieve 100% GER in Pre-school to Secondary Level :   2035
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to 50% by 2035, not 2030. It also targets increasing public investment in education to 6% of GDP at the earliest,  and achieving 100% GER in preschool to secondary level by 2030. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatching of target years for the policy features. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the NEP 2020's goals and timelines, requiring accurate recall of the specific target years mentioned in the policy document.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                               :   Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                    :   Global Hunger Index
2. UNDESA                                   :   Sustainable Development Goals Progress Report
3. IFPRI                                     :   State of World Population Report
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) releases the State of World Population Report, not the Global Hunger Index. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) publishes the Sustainable Development Goals Progress Report. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) releases the Global Food Policy Report, not the State of World Population Report.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various international organizations and their respective publications and initiatives.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related organizations and their work.


**8. With reference to the Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report, consider the following pairs:**

   Category of Displaced People              :   Percentage in 2022
1. Children                                 :   76%
2. People hosted by Low- and middle-income countries :   30%
3. Stateless people                          :   2% increase over 2021
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

According to the report, 30% of forcibly displaced people were children, not 76%.  76% of the world's refugees were hosted by low and middle-income countries.  There was a 2% increase in stateless people compared to 2021. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall of specific data points from the report, requiring precise knowledge of the percentages reported.  The incorrect options use figures from the report but misapply them to the different categories of displaced people.


**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   **Educational Emphasis**                     **Stage of Schooling**
1.  Capacities for Scientific Inquiry           :   Foundational Stage (Ages 3-8)
2.  Interdisciplinary Areas of Study            :   Secondary Stage (Ages 14-18)
3.  Environmental Education                  :   Preparatory Stage (Ages 8-11)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE outlines a phased approach to education, aligning subjects with appropriate developmental stages.  While scientific inquiry is crucial throughout schooling, the NCF-SE emphasizes its development across all stages, not solely the foundational stage. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Interdisciplinary studies, as a distinct subject, are introduced at the secondary level to allow for a more comprehensive understanding of interconnected concepts. This makes statement 2 correct. Environmental education, although important throughout, is not exclusively focused on the preparatory stage; it's integrated across multiple levels, culminating in a separate area of study at the secondary stage, hence, statement 3 is incorrect.  The correct answer is (b) because only the pairing of Interdisciplinary Areas of Study with the Secondary Stage accurately reflects the NCF-SE's structure.


**2. Consider the following pairs related to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

   **NEP 2020 Aim**                            **Target Year**
1. Achieve 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education : 2025
2. Achieve 100% GER in preschool to secondary level           : 2030
3. Increase public investment in education to 6% of GDP        : 2035

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 sets ambitious targets for educational improvements.  The target year for achieving a 50% GER in higher education is 2035, not 2025, making statement 1 incorrect. The NEP aims for 100% GER in preschool to secondary education by 2030, making statement 2 correct.  The policy also targets increasing public investment to 6% of GDP as soon as possible, but a specific target year of 2035 is not explicitly mentioned, rendering statement 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

   **PGI Grade**                                 **State/UT in 2021-22**
1. Daksh                                        :   Punjab
2. Prachesta – 2                               :   Chandigarh
3. Akanshi – 3                                  :   Arunachal Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PGI uses a ten-grade system to assess school education performance.  No state or UT achieved the highest grade (Daksh) in 2021-22, rendering statement 1 incorrect.  Both Punjab and Chandigarh attained the Prachesta – 2 grade, making statement 2 correct.  Arunachal Pradesh was indeed in the lowest grade (Akanshi – 3) in 2021-22, confirming statement 3.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs regarding higher education institutions in India:**

   **Institution Type**                             **Relevant Act/Regulation**
1. Deemed-to-be Universities                     :   UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2019
2. Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs)   :   UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of FHEIs in India) Regulations, 2023
3. National Research Foundation (NRF)           :   Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The regulation of various higher education entities in India involves different acts and regulations. While Deemed-to-be Universities are governed by the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, the 2023 version superseded the 2019 version, making statement 1 incorrect. The entry of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions is indeed regulated by the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of FHEIs in India) Regulations, 2023, making statement 2 correct. The National Research Foundation is established under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, making statement 3 correct. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   **Framework Element**                          **Corresponding Framework**
1. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) :   Higher Education
2. National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)    :   Vocational Education
3. National Curriculum Framework (NCF)           :   Skill Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF integrates various qualification frameworks. The NHEQF is specifically designed for Higher Education, making statement 1 correct. The NSQF is indeed for Vocational Education, making statement 2 correct.  However, the NCF (or NSEQF - National School Education Qualification Framework) is related to school education, not skill education directly, although there is integration; the primary focus of NCF is school education, making statement 3 incorrect. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched.



**6. Consider the following pairs relating to organizations involved in addressing global issues:**

   **Organization**                                 **Headquarters Location**
1.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Rome, Italy
2.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) :   Geneva, Switzerland
3.  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) :   New York, USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Several international organizations work on global challenges.  The IFPRI's headquarters are located in Washington, D.C., USA, not Rome, Italy, making statement 1 incorrect.  The UNHCR is indeed headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, making statement 2 correct. The GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York, USA, making statement 3 incorrect. Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and related reporting, consider the following pairs:**

   **Indicator/Report**                            **Releasing Organization**
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                     :   World Food Programme (WFP)
2. Global Gender Gap Index                      :   World Economic Forum
3. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report :   United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Several organizations release reports related to the SDGs.  The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the WFP, making statement 1 incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Index is indeed released by the World Economic Forum, making statement 2 correct. The SDG Progress Report is published by the UNDESA, making statement 3 correct.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs concerning government schemes and initiatives in India:**

   **Scheme/Initiative**                           **Ministry/Department**
1.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)             :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  Poshan Abhiyaan                             :   Ministry of Rural Development
3.  National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) :   Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Several government schemes address social issues. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) falls under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development, making statement 1 incorrect.  Poshan Abhiyaan is primarily under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Rural Development, making statement 2 incorrect.  The NAMASTE scheme is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, making statement 3 correct.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched. Note that while the Ministry of Rural Development plays a role in Poshan Abhiyaan's implementation, the nodal ministry is the Ministry of Women and Child Development.




**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                 Specific Feature
1. Foundational Stage                     :   Ages 3-8
2. Preparatory Stage                      :   Ages 8-11
3. Secondary Stage                       :   Ages 14-18
4.  Multilingualism                       :  Proficiency in at least three languages, two Indian
5. Vocational Education                   :   Engagement in work with life forms, materials, and human services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE outlines a new curricular and pedagogical structure dividing schooling into 5+3+3+4 stages based on age groups.  Option (c) correctly matches all five pairs. The Foundational Stage (ages 3-8), Preparatory Stage (ages 8-11), and Secondary Stage (ages 14-18) are explicitly defined within the framework.  The NCF-SE strongly emphasizes multilingualism, advocating for proficiency in at least three languages, with a preference for at least two Indian languages.  Finally, the framework integrates vocational education, proposing engagement in three distinct forms of work:  work with life forms (agriculture, animal husbandry), work with materials and machines, and work in human services.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  Option (a) only includes the Foundational Stage. Option (b) leaves out the multilingualism and vocational education aspects. Option (d) omits the multilingualism component. Therefore, only option (c) comprehensively reflects the key features of the NCF-SE as described.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

   Parameter                                    Value/Characteristic
1.  Highest Grade Achieved in PGI 2.0       :    Daksh
2.  States/UTs in Lowest Grade (Akanshi-3)  :    Punjab and Chandigarh
3.  Data Sources for PGI                     :    UDISE+ and NAS data
4.  PGI-D Report Coverage                  :   Outcomes, classroom transactions, school safety
5.  First Year of PGI Release for States/UTs :    2021-22

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PGI uses data from UDISE+ and NAS, making pair 3 correct.  The PGI-D report focuses on outcomes, classroom transactions, and school safety, making pair 4 correct.  However, the other pairs are incorrect.  In PGI 2.0, no state achieved the highest grade (Daksh); Punjab and Chandigarh reached Prachesta-2, not Akanshi-3. The first release of the PGI for states/UTs was in 2017-18, not 2021-22. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (b) is the only option that correctly identifies the accurately matched pairs.


**3. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                         Characteristic/Data Point
1.  NEP 2020 Target GER by 2035           :   28.4%
2.  Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore:   Top-ranked Indian University in Times Higher Education 2024
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)    :   Aims to catalyze research and innovation
4.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)          :  Stores academic credits earned from various institutions digitally
5.  Times Higher Education 2024 Ranking of Indian Universities :  91 universities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50% by 2035, not 28.4%, which was the actual GER in 2021-22. IISc Bangalore was in the 201-250 bracket, not the top-ranked Indian university.  However, the NRF does aim to catalyze research and innovation (pair 3), the ABC digitally stores academic credits (pair 4), and 91 Indian universities were included in the Times Higher Education 2024 rankings (pair 5).  Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**4.  With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Regulation                                 Characteristic
1.  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 :  Supersedes 2019 regulations
2.  NCERT after receiving DTBU status                 :   Can offer doctoral degrees
3.  Institutions less than 20 years old                    : Ineligible for DTBU status under 2019 regulations
4.  Cluster of institutions under multiple sponsoring bodies:   Can apply for DTBU status under 2023 regulations
5.  UGC Act 1956                                      :  Provides for Central Government declaration of DTBU status

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 UGC regulations do supersede the 2019 regulations, making pair 1 correct.  NCERT, after receiving DTBU status, can indeed offer doctoral degrees, making pair 2 correct.  Under the 2019 regulations, institutions less than 20 years old were ineligible for DTBU status, making pair 3 correct.  The 2023 regulations allow clusters of institutions under multiple sponsors to apply, making pair 4 correct. Finally, the UGC Act 1956 provides the legal basis for the central government's declaration of DTBUs, making pair 5 correct.  Therefore, all pairs except pair 3 are correctly matched. Option (c) correctly identifies all the accurately matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.



**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   Component/Feature                                 Detail
1.  National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF):  One of the frameworks integrated into NCrF
2.  Levels 1-4 in NCrF                               :   Higher Education
3.  Concept of Notional Learning Hours                :  1200 hours/year for all education levels
4.  Credit Accumulation and Transfer                   :  Enables lifelong learning and flexibility
5.  National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)    :  Not integrated into NCrF


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NHEQF is one of the frameworks integrated into the NCrF (pair 1).  The concept of notional learning hours is set at 1200 hours per year across all education levels (pair 3). The credit accumulation and transfer mechanism supports lifelong learning and flexibility (pair 4). However, levels 1-4 in the NCrF refer to school education, not higher education (pair 2), and the NSQF *is* integrated into the NCrF (pair 5). Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (b) is the only option that correctly identifies the accurately matched pairs.


**6. With reference to the Accreditation of Higher Education Institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Concept                                     Feature
1.  National Accreditation Council (NAC)             :   Envisioned as a meta-accrediting body in NEP 2020
2.  Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee Recommendations :   Proposed a binary accreditation system
3.  Composite Assessment System (CAS)               :   Amalgamates programme and institution accreditation
4.  NAAC's 8-point grading system                    :  Retained under the new accreditation regime
5.  Higher Education Commission of India (HECI)      :  NAC is one of its four verticals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NAC is indeed envisioned as a meta-accrediting body in NEP 2020 (pair 1). The Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a binary accreditation system (pair 2), and the CAS amalgamates programme and institution accreditation (pair 3).  The HECI does include the NAC as one of its four verticals (pair 5). However, NAAC's 8-point grading system is being transitioned away from, not retained (pair 4).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**7. With reference to the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5), consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                      Value/Characteristic
1.  Total Fertility Rate (TFR)                       :  Around 2.0
2.  Life Expectancy of Indian Females               :  71 years
3.  NFHS-5 Data Collection Period                   :   2019-2021
4.  Primary Source of NFHS-5 Data                    :  International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
5.  Age Group for TFR Calculation                   :  Women aged 15-49 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The TFR is approximately 2.0 (pair 1), and the TFR calculation uses data from women aged 15-49 (pair 5).  However, other pairs are incorrect.  The life expectancy for Indian females is approximately 74 years, not 71 (pair 2).  While the IIPS collaborates with the NFHS, it's not the *primary* source of data (pair 4).  NFHS-5 data collection spanned 2019-2021 (pair 3). Therefore, only pairs 1 and 5 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (a) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**8. With reference to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Policy                                  Feature
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                         :   Addresses health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels
2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)         :  National portability of health services
3.  National Health Policy 2017                     :   Aims to achieve UHC at affordable cost
4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush                :  Focuses on reaching zero-dose children and pregnant women
5.  UHC Key Dimensions                             : Accessibility, Affordability, and Quality


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Ayushman Bharat Yojana holistically addresses health at all levels (pair 1). ABDM promotes national portability of health services (pair 2). The National Health Policy 2017 aims for UHC at affordable costs (pair 3). Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on vaccinating zero-dose children and pregnant women (pair 4).  Finally, accessibility, affordability, and quality are key dimensions of UHC (pair 5).  Therefore, option (c) is correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**9. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Component/Feature                                      Characteristic
1.  Anganwadi Services Scheme                          :   Centrally Sponsored Scheme under MoWCD
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Helpers (AWHs)     :  Receive fixed monthly honorarium
3.  Poshan Tracker                                      :   Mobile application for nutrition service delivery tracking
4.  National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children   :  Embodies a social model for inclusive care
5.  Saksham Anganwadis                                 :  Focuses exclusively on children aged 0-6 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Anganwadi Services Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme under the MoWCD (pair 1). AWWs and AWHs receive a fixed monthly honorarium (pair 2).  The Poshan Tracker is a mobile app for tracking nutrition service delivery (pair 3). The National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children promotes inclusive care (pair 4). However, Saksham Anganwadis also focus on adolescent girls and early childhood care and education, not exclusively on children aged 0-6 (pair 5). Thus, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**10. With reference to Organizations in News, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Key Function/Report
1.  UNFPA                                     :  Released India Ageing Report 2023
2.  UNDESA                                    :  Released SDG Progress Report 2023
3.  World Food Programme (WFP)                 :  Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020
4.  IFPRI                                      :  Released Global Food Policy Report 2023
5.  UNHCR                                     : Released "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. The UNFPA released the India Ageing Report 2023 (pair 1). UNDESA released the SDG Progress Report 2023 (pair 2). The WFP was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 (pair 3). IFPRI released the Global Food Policy Report 2023 (pair 4). UNHCR released the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" (pair 5).  Therefore, option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                              :   Odisha
2. Kamar PVTG                               :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                               :   Chhattisgarh
4.  Hakki Pikki Tribe                        :   Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic tribal group from Karnataka.  The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in multiple states.  While the Bharia tribe is found in Madhya Pradesh, and the Baiga and Kamar tribes are present in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Odisha is not listed as a location for these three PVTGs. Therefore, only pair 3 (Baiga PVTG : Chhattisgarh) and pair 4 (Hakki Pikki Tribe : Karnataka) are correctly matched.  The other pairs present incorrect state/UT associations for the specified PVTGs.  Understanding the geographical distribution of PVTGs is crucial for effective tribal welfare policies.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                       Ministry
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :    Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Ministry of Labour and Employment
3.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
4. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0           :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, also falls under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 are under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  This question tests the understanding of the governmental structure and the ministries responsible for various social welfare schemes in India.  Mismatching ministries with their respective acts and schemes highlights the need for candidates to possess thorough knowledge of governmental organization.


**3. With reference to Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Committee                        Recommendation
1.  U N Dhebar Commission (1961)              :   Renamed PTGs as PVTGs in 2006.
2.  Idate Commission                           :    Establishment of a permanent commission for DNTs.
3. Renke Commission (2008)                   :   Identified nearly 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The U N Dhebar Commission (1961) initially recognized Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).  The renaming of PTGs to PVTGs (Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups) occurred in 2006. The Idate Commission recommended the establishment of a permanent commission for De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs). The Renke Commission (2008) estimated the number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes in India. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of crucial commissions and committees related to tribal welfare and their significant recommendations. Accurate matching demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of tribal welfare policies in India.



**4. With reference to Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Provision                                 Feature
1.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Recognizes 10 types of disabilities.
2.  Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995          :   Established the Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD.
3.  RPwD Act 2016                               :   Reservation is applicable to police forces.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 10. The Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995, indeed established the Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD.  The RPwD Act 2016 specifies that reservation for PwDs is *not* applicable to police forces. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the legal framework concerning PwDs in India, highlighting the evolution of legislation and the key provisions related to rights and reservations.  Incorrect options test the candidate's ability to differentiate between factual details and potential misconceptions surrounding the acts.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                                    Objective
1.  Mission Karmayogi                            :   Transform the Indian civil service into a competent workforce.
2.  Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana                 :   Boost conventional biofuel projects.
3.  Jiyo Parsi Scheme                             :  Stabilize the Parsi population in India.
4.  Boeing Sukanya Program                       :   Support girls' entry into the space sector


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi aims to transform the Indian civil service. Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana aims to boost *advanced* biofuel projects, not conventional ones. The Jiyo Parsi Scheme aims to stabilize the Parsi population. The Boeing Sukanya Program supports girls' entry into the *aviation* sector, not the space sector.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's awareness of various government schemes and programs aimed at different social groups and sectors.  The inclusion of slightly incorrect or misleading options assesses the candidate's ability to critically evaluate the objectives of these initiatives.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                   Organization/Body
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                     :   Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
2. Global Gender Gap Index                       :    United Nations Development Programme
3.  Universal Health Coverage (UHC) SCI         :    World Economic Forum
4.  Path to Equal Report                           :   UN Women and UNDP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum. The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI) is released by the WHO and World Bank. The Path to Equal Report is jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various international indices and reports related to social development, requiring them to correctly associate the reports with the organizations responsible for their publication.  The incorrect options serve as distractors, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding organizations and their respective publications.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Village                                  Characteristic
1. ODF Village                                   :   Every household uses safe sanitation technology.
2. ODF Plus Village                              :   Sustained ODF status and implemented solid waste management.
3. ODF Plus Model Village                         :   Sustained ODF status, arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, and visual cleanliness.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

An ODF (Open Defecation Free) village signifies that every household and public institution uses safe sanitation technology, eliminating open defecation.  An ODF Plus village builds upon this by also implementing either solid or liquid waste management systems. An ODF Plus Model Village further enhances this by having arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, maintaining visual cleanliness, and displaying relevant IEC messages. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of the Swachh Bharat Mission's different stages and their associated criteria.  The progressive nature of the definitions makes it crucial for candidates to accurately understand the nuances of each level.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                          State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                              :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                               :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                                :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4. Hakki Pikki Tribe                         :   Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are incorrectly matched as presented. The Hakki Pikki Tribe is a semi-nomadic tribal group from Karnataka, making option (d) the only correct match.  The question tests factual recall of tribal groups and their geographical locations, highlighting the complexity of tribal demographics across Indian states. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options (Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga in states other than their actual presence) serves as effective distractors, making the question challenging.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                  Ministry
1.  National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  Anganwadi Services Scheme                : Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) : Ministry of Rural Development
4.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  The Anganwadi Services Scheme is indeed under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is a program of the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Rural Development. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, correctly falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The question tests knowledge of government schemes and their respective ministries, requiring accurate recall of administrative responsibilities.  The inclusion of incorrect ministry attributions acts as a strong distractor, assessing the candidate's understanding of the organizational structure of Indian governance.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                     Description
1. Reservation in Government jobs           : Not less than 5% reservation
2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions: Not applicable to police forces
3. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities: Every child with benchmark disability between the age of 6 to 18 years shall have the right to free education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Act specifies that reservation is not applicable to police forces (including Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT police forces), making statement 2 correct.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the Act's provision for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18. The question assesses the candidate's detailed understanding of the specific provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016, requiring precise recall of numerical data and policy details.  The inclusion of a nearly correct but ultimately false statement (regarding job reservation) creates a challenging distractor.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                           Report/Index
1.  UNFPA                                 :   Global Hunger Index
2.  UNDESA                               :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report
3.  IFPRI                                  :   India Ageing Report
4.  World Food Programme (WFP)          :   Global Report on Food Crisis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) releases the State of World Population report, including data on India's ageing population, not the Global Hunger Index.  The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) accurately releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) publishes the Global Food Policy Report, not the India Ageing Report. The World Food Programme (WFP) correctly releases the Global Report on Food Crisis. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations and their respective publications, demanding precise recall of reports and associated agencies.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings (UNFPA with the wrong report, IFPRI with the wrong report) serves as effective distractors, increasing the question's difficulty.


**5. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) for School Education, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                     Description
1.  Credit System                            : Divides education into 10 levels
2.  Notional Learning Hours                  : Refers to time needed for attending classes, tests, and assignments.
3.  Multiple Entry and Exit Options          : Enables lifelong learning through credit transfer.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF divides education into 8 levels, not 10, making statement 1 incorrect. The description of Notional Learning Hours in statement 2 is accurate.  Statement 3 correctly describes the concept of Multiple Entry and Exit Options within the NCF. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the key components of the NCF, demanding accurate recall of numerical data (number of levels) and conceptual understanding of educational frameworks.  The incorrect statement regarding the number of levels serves as a strong distractor, assessing the candidate's precise knowledge of the NCF framework.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Key Feature
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021          : Allows only commercial surrogacy.
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 : Allows termination up to 24 weeks for all women.
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013  :  Imposes a maximum fine of ₹50,000.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, allows only altruistic surrogacy, not commercial surrogacy, making statement 1 incorrect. The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women and up to 24 weeks under specific conditions, making statement 2 incorrect. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, imposes a maximum fine of ₹One Lakh, not ₹50,000, making statement 3 incorrect. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various acts related to social issues, requiring precise recall of key provisions and their limitations.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect details in each statement makes this a difficult question, assessing the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar-sounding but ultimately different legal frameworks.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                              Target Group
1.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush             : Pregnant women and children aged 0-5 years
2.  Subhadra scheme                             : Poor men aged 21-60
3.  Lakhpati Didi Yojana                        : Women in urban areas
4.  PMJDY                                      : Unbanked adults

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Intensified Mission Indradhanush correctly targets pregnant women and children aged 0-5 years. The Subhadra scheme targets poor women, not men, aged 21-60.  The Lakhpati Didi Yojana targets women in rural areas, not urban areas. PMJDY correctly targets unbanked adults. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of government schemes and their target beneficiaries, requiring accurate recall of specific details. The inclusion of incorrect target groups for several schemes creates a challenging distractor, assessing the candidate's precise understanding of social welfare programs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                         Mandate/Function
1.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) : Prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
2.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)  : Implement the Idate Commission report.
3.  Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD        :  Oversee the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCDNT accurately has the mandate to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes. The NHRC's role is to investigate human rights violations, not specifically to implement the Idate Commission report, though it stressed the need for its implementation. The Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD deals with the rights of persons with disabilities, not with the implementation of the NEP 2020. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the roles and responsibilities of various commissions and bodies in India, requiring precise knowledge of their mandates.  The inclusion of plausible but inaccurate statements regarding the NHRC and the Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD functions as effective distractors, increasing question difficulty.


**1. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program              Key Feature/Objective
1. Saksham Anganwadis           :   Focuses solely on improving AWCs for children aged 0-6 years.
2. POSHAN Abhiyan               :   Aims to reduce stunting in districts with high malnutrition.
3. Intensified Mission Indradhanush:  Targets zero-dose children aged 0-5 years and pregnant women.
4. Anganwadi Services Scheme    :   Includes compensation for AWWs and AWHs through a fixed honorarium.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because pairs 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the features and objectives of the respective schemes.  POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) explicitly aims to reduce stunting in high-malnutrition districts.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on achieving zero-dose children and pregnant women's vaccination coverage. The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, indeed provides a fixed honorarium to Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs).

Option (a) is incorrect because Saksham Anganwadis, while improving AWCs, also expands its scope to include adolescent girls and early childhood care and education, going beyond the 0-6 age group specified in the pair.  Option (b) is incorrect as it excludes the accurate pairing of the Anganwadi Services Scheme with its compensation structure. Option (d) is incorrect because of the inaccuracy in pair 1, as detailed above.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of government schemes related to child welfare and nutrition.


**2. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   NEP 2020 Provision                 Specific Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)        :   Aims for 100% GER in preschool to secondary level by 2035.
2. Multiple Exit Options             :   Allows students to exit after first, second, or third years with certifications or degrees.
3. National Research Foundation (NRF):   Replaces the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).
4. National Credit Framework (NCrF)   :   Integrates credits from school, higher education, and vocational training.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct.  NEP 2020 does aim for 100% GER in preschool to secondary education by 2030, not 2035 (a common distractor). The policy introduces multiple exit options in undergraduate programs, allowing students to earn certifications or degrees after completing one, two, or three years. The National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, effectively replaces the SERB. The NCrF integrates credits from different educational pathways for seamless transitions.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are accurately matched. Pair 1 is incorrect due to the year mentioned (2030, not 2035).  The question tests the understanding of NEP 2020's key provisions and their implementation.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   GHI Aspect                        Data/Fact
1. GHI Ranking of India in 2023       :   125th out of 125 countries
2. GHI Score Category for India        :   Severe
3. Measurement Components of GHI  :   Undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality
4. Organizations publishing GHI     :   World Bank and UNICEF

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The GHI uses Undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality as its components.  India's 2023 GHI ranking was 101st, not 125th, and its category was "Serious," not "Severe."  The GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank and UNICEF. The question tests factual knowledge about the GHI, its methodology, and India's performance.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect data in pairs 1, 2, and 4 makes this a challenging question.


**4. Consider the following pairs related to Child Labour in India:**

   Act/Scheme                      Feature/Objective
1. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016:  Prohibits employment of children below 18 years.
2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme: Establishes rehabilitation centers for child laborers.
3. PENCiL Portal                    :  Managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
4. ILO Convention 182                :   Focuses on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The NCLP scheme indeed establishes rehabilitation centers, and ILO Convention 182 targets the worst forms of child labor.  The 2016 amendment prohibits children below 14, not 18, from working. The PENCiL portal is managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  This question tests factual knowledge of legislation and schemes related to child labor, highlighting the importance of accurate details in understanding policy implementation.


**5. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of Surrogacy Act             Feature
1. Allowed type of surrogacy           :   Commercial surrogacy
2. Governing Body                      :   National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB)
3.  Regulation of Donor Gametes       :  Prohibits the use of donor gametes in all cases.
4. Abortion of Surrogate Child         : Requires only the surrogate mother's consent for abortion.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, establishes the NARTSB.  The Act allows only altruistic surrogacy, not commercial surrogacy. The use of donor gametes is regulated, but not completely prohibited under specific medical conditions.  Abortion of a surrogate child requires the consent of both the surrogate mother and authorization from appropriate authorities compliant with the MTP Act, 1971. The question tests detailed knowledge of the Surrogacy Act, emphasizing the need for precise understanding of legal provisions.  The inclusion of incorrect or partially correct information in other pairs increases the difficulty level.


**6. With reference to Manual Scavenging, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                     Key Provision/Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:  Provides for the demolition of all insanitary latrines within one year of enactment.
2.  NAMASTE scheme                               :   Focuses exclusively on the mechanization of solid waste management.
3.  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)   :  Provides financial assistance and training for alternative employment.
4. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                          : Offers concessional loans for purchasing sanitation equipment.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The SRMS scheme does provide financial aid and training for alternative employment. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana offers concessional loans for sanitation equipment.  The 2013 Act doesn't mandate demolition within one year; it sets a timeframe, but it's not strictly one year. The NAMASTE scheme addresses mechanization of various sanitation tasks, not just solid waste. The question tests knowledge of specific schemes and legislation related to manual scavenging and their implementation details.  The inclusion of partially correct or incorrect information in other pairs enhances the challenge.


**7.  With reference to Women's Issues in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                 Specific Provision/Focus
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024: Allows surrogacy for single women using only self-eggs and donor sperms.
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971: Permits abortion up to 24 weeks for all women.
3. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013: Mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in all workplaces.
4.  Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023: Aims to provide paid menstrual leave to all women.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The 2024 Surrogacy Rules allow surrogacy for single women under specific conditions. The Sexual Harassment Act mandates ICCs. The MTP Act allows abortion up to 20 weeks (with exceptions), not 24 weeks. The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy doesn't mandate paid menstrual leave.  The question tests knowledge of various Acts and policies related to women's rights and health in India, emphasizing the importance of precise details in understanding legal and policy frameworks.


**8. With reference to Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Group                             Characteristic/Status
1.  PVTGs                                   :   Constitute the majority of Scheduled Tribes in India.
2.  Bharia Tribe                              :  Recognized as a PVTG only in Madhya Pradesh.
3.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT):  Prepares a state-wise list of DNTs.
4.  Idate Commission Report                 :  Recommends setting up a permanent commission for PVTGs.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The NCDNT does prepare a state-wise list of Denotified Tribes (DNTs).  PVTGs are a subset of Scheduled Tribes, not the majority. The Bharia tribe is recognized as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Idate Commission report recommended a permanent commission for DNTs, not PVTGs. The question tests knowledge about the classification of tribal groups and the role of various commissions and reports in tribal welfare.  The inclusion of partially correct or incorrect information in other pairs makes the question challenging.





**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                      Releasing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index                 :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index              :   World Economic Forum
3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index :   World Bank and WHO
4. Path to Equal Report                     :    UN Women and UNDP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.  The UNDP releases the Gender Social Norms Index. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is indeed a joint release by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank. The Path to Equal Report is a joint publication of UN Women and UNDP. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                     Key Parameter
1. Global Gender Gap Index                 :   Service Capacity and Access
2. Gender Social Norms Index              :    Political Empowerment
3. Universal Health Coverage SCI           :    Economic Participation and Opportunity
4. Women’s Empowerment Index             :    Physical Integrity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index uses parameters like Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment.  The Gender Social Norms Index focuses on Political, Educational, Economic, and Physical integrity dimensions. The UHC SCI includes categories like reproductive health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and service capacity and access. The Women’s Empowerment Index focuses on women's power and freedoms. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 correctly match the index with one of its key parameters.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they include mismatched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Report Published
1. UNFPA                                         :   Global Food Policy Report
2. UNDESA                                        :   Sustainable Development Goals Progress Report
3. UN Commission on Population and Development :   State of World Population Report
4. World Food Programme                       :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA publishes the State of World Population report, not the Global Food Policy Report.  The UNDESA indeed releases the Sustainable Development Goals Progress Report. The UN Commission on Population and Development does not directly publish reports; it monitors implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development. The World Food Programme does not publish the Global Trends: Forced Displacement Report; that is published by UNHCR.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Headquarters
1. UNFPA                                         :   Rome, Italy
2. UNDESA                                        :   Geneva, Switzerland
3. UN Committee on Rights of the Child          :   New York, USA
4. GANHRI                                        :   New York, USA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA's headquarters are in New York, USA, not Rome, Italy.  The UNDESA headquarters are in New York, USA, not Geneva, Switzerland. The UN Committee on Rights of the Child meets in Geneva but its administrative headquarters are in New York. GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :   Allows commercial surrogacy
2. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Promotes the use of insanitary latrines
3. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Recognizes only 10 types of disabilities
4. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020        :   Advocates for a 4+3+3+4 schooling structure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act aims to eliminate manual scavenging, not promote insanitary latrines. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not just 10. The NEP 2020 proposes a 5+3+3+4 schooling structure, not a 4+3+3+4 structure. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry/Organization                          Scheme/Initiative
1. Ministry of Women and Child Development   :   National Child Labour Project
2. Ministry of Labour and Employment          :   Poshan Abhiyan
3. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare      :   Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy
4. Ministry of Tribal Affairs                    :   PENCiL Portal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Women and Child Development is indeed associated with the Anganwadi services which are part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme, and not the National Child Labour Project (which falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment). The Ministry of Labour and Employment oversees the PENCIL portal and not the Poshan Abhiyan (which is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development). The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare did release the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is not associated with the PENCIL portal (which is under the Ministry of Labour and Employment). Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                          Key Finding
1. Global Hunger Index 2023                     :   India ranked 101st
2. India Ageing Report 2023                     :    India's population surpassed China's in mid-2023
3. Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report:  76% of world's refugees hosted by high-income countries
4.  Global Food Policy Report 2023              :  Food insecurity increased during 2020-2022


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index 2023 ranked India 111th, not 101st. The India Ageing Report 2023 correctly highlights that India's population surpassed China's in mid-2023. The Global Trends report correctly states that 76% of the world's refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries, not high-income countries. The Global Food Policy Report 2023 accurately notes the increase in food insecurity during 2020-2022. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Body                                  Report/Recommendation
1. Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee                 :   Caste Census Report
2. Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour     :  Assessment of child suspects in heinous offences
3. National Commission for Protection of Child Rights: Reforms in the accreditation system of HEIs
4. Idate Commission                              :   Recommendations for a permanent commission for DNTs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee focused on reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions, not the Caste Census. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour did not issue guidelines for the assessment of child suspects (that was done by NCPCR). The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) issued guidelines for the assessment of child suspects, not the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour.  The Idate Commission did indeed recommend setting up a permanent commission for De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs). Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.  The other options include incorrectly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Initiative                      Ministry/Organization
1.  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) : Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  Saksham Anganwadis                      : Ministry of Education
3.  POSHAN Abhiyan                          : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
4.  National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) : Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.  The other pairs are incorrectly matched. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) falls under the Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Saksham Anganwadis are a part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme, which is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  POSHAN Abhiyan, while related to nutrition and child development, is primarily driven by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs focuses on the welfare of tribal communities. Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrectly matched pairs, making them incorrect.


**2. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                   Key Feature
1.  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 : Allows institutions less than 20 years old to apply for Deemed University status.
2.  National Credit Framework (NCrF) Report       :  Exclusively focuses on higher education credit accumulation.
3.  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020          :  Mandates a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 75% by 2035.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, significantly lowered the age requirement for institutions seeking Deemed University status from 20 years to less than 20 years. Pair 2 is incorrect because the NCrF integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education, not solely higher education. Pair 3 is incorrect; NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50%, not 75%, by 2035.  Therefore, only option (a) accurately reflects the correct matching. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, thus rendering them incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Report/Initiative
1.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) : Global Hunger Index (GHI)
2.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)       :  India Ageing Report 2023
3.  World Health Organization (WHO)                :  Triple Threat Report on WASH


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The UNFPA released the India Ageing Report 2023, and UNICEF, in collaboration with other organizations, released the Triple Threat Report on WASH.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Global Hunger Index (GHI) is not produced by IFPRI.  Therefore, option (c) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4. With reference to the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) and its related aspects, consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                               Data Source
1.  PGI 2.0 for States/UTs                     :  National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2022
2.  PGI-D combined report for 2020-21 & 2021-22 : Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) 2021-22 data
3.  PGI 2.0 for the year 2021-22               :  National Sample Survey (NSS) data


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. PGI 2.0 for States/UTs and the PGI-D combined report both utilize data from the National Achievement Survey (NAS) and UDISE+. Pair 3 is incorrect; PGI 2.0 does not use NSS data. Therefore, option (b) is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly represent the data sources used for the indices.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Act/Policy                                  Key Provision/Focus
1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA) 2005 : Defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse.
2.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) :  Includes a provision for monetary compensation to manual scavengers.
3.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021             : Permits only commercial surrogacy.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. PWDVA 2005 encompasses various forms of domestic violence, not just physical abuse. PEMSR does not include monetary compensation; it focuses on rehabilitation and alternative employment. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, specifically prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) all contain at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**6. With reference to the  reports and indices related to global development, consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                  Producing Organization(s)
1.  Global Gender Gap Index                      :  United Nations Development Programme
2.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023 : UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
3.  Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI) : World Bank only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The UNDESA produces the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report. Pair 1 is incorrect; the Global Gender Gap Index is produced by the World Economic Forum.  Pair 3 is incorrect; the UHC SCI is jointly produced by the WHO and the World Bank. Therefore, option (b) is the only correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                      Key Impact
1.  MTP (Amendment) Act 2021                         :  Reduced the maximum permissible gestational age for abortion to 12 weeks.
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Introduced a provision for trying children aged 16-18 as adults for heinous offenses.
3.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016 :  Completely banned child labour in all sectors.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Juvenile Justice Act of 2015 introduced the provision of trying children aged 16-18 as adults for heinous offenses. Pair 1 is incorrect. The MTP Amendment Act of 2021 increased the gestational age limit for abortion in certain circumstances, not reduced it. Pair 3 is also incorrect; the Child Labour Amendment Act of 2016 prohibits the employment of children below 14 years and adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations, but doesn't completely ban child labour in all sectors. Therefore, only option (b) is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**8.  With reference to Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Category of Tribal Group                            Defining Characteristic
1.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)     :  Exclusively reside in urban areas.
2.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                        :  Were officially designated as criminal tribes during British rule.
3.  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes                 : Always engage in agriculture.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Denotified Tribes were indeed labeled as criminal tribes during British rule. Pair 1 is incorrect; PVTGs are not limited to urban areas; they can be found in both rural and sometimes peri-urban areas.  Pair 3 is incorrect; nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes do not always engage in agriculture; their livelihoods can vary greatly.  Therefore, only option (b) is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrectly matched pairs.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                  Ministry
1. Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0    : Ministry of Women and Child Development
3. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme : Ministry of Labour and Employment
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission, announced in the Union Budget 2023-24, falls under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, not the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme is indeed under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, focusing on improving the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme is correctly paired with the Ministry of Labour and Employment, aiming to rehabilitate child laborers through special schools and rehabilitation centers.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because pair 1 is wrongly matched. Option (b) is incorrect because it only includes pair 2, omitting the correctly matched pair 3. Option (d) is incorrect due to the mismatched pair 1.


**2. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                                 Specific Implementation
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target       : 50% by 2035 in Higher Education
2. Multidisciplinary Education                  : Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs)
3. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)             : Digital storage of academic credits earned from various institutions
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 indeed aims for a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% by 2035 in higher education.  The policy promotes multidisciplinary education through the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) across the country.  The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a key initiative to digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions, enhancing flexibility and mobility in higher education.  All three pairs accurately reflect the NEP 2020's features and their implementations.  Therefore, option (d) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and do not capture the full extent of the NEP 2020's correctly matched implementations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  Index/Report                                     Releasing Organization(s)
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                     : Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
2. Global Gender Gap Index                       : World Economic Forum
3. Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI) : World Bank and WHO
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is indeed released annually by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The Global Gender Gap Index is accurately attributed to the World Economic Forum.  The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI) is correctly linked to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.  Thus, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**4. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   Framework Component                            Description
1. Levels 1-4                                    : Higher Education
2. Levels 4.5-8                                  : School Education
3. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) :  Part of the NCrF's integrated framework
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF divides education into eight levels. Levels 1-4 refer to school education, not higher education, making pair 1 incorrect.  Levels 4.5-8 refer to higher education, not school education, making pair 2 incorrect.  The National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) is indeed a component of the integrated NCrF framework, making pair 3 correct.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the mismatched pairs 1 and/or 2.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Act/Regulation                                    Key Provision
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Bans manual scavenging
2.  Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 :  Provides for a certificate of identity based on self-perceived gender identity.
3.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 : Defines domestic violence to include only physical abuse.
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, correctly bans the practice of manual scavenging. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, accurately provides for a certificate of identity based on self-perceived gender identity. However, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, defines domestic violence more comprehensively, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse; thus, statement 3 is incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they include the mismatched pair 3.


**6. With reference to the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                                        PGI Grade in 2021-22
1. Punjab                                         : Daksh
2. Chandigarh                                     : Prachesta-2
3. Arunachal Pradesh                             : Akanshi-3
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

In the PGI 2.0 for 2021-22, no state or UT achieved the highest grade, Daksh, making pair 1 incorrect.  Chandigarh did achieve the Prachesta-2 grade, making pair 2 correct.  Arunachal Pradesh was indeed in the lowest grade, Akanshi-3, making pair 3 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include the mismatched pair 1.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization                                     Report/Index
1. UNFPA                                          : Global Food Policy Report 2023
2. UNDESA                                         : Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3. IFPRI                                           : India Ageing Report 2023
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) released the India Ageing Report 2023, not the Global Food Policy Report 2023.  The UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) correctly released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023. The IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) released the Global Food Policy Report 2023, not the India Ageing Report 2023. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the mismatched pairs 1 and/or 3.


**8. With reference to the  National Medical Commission (NMC), consider the following pairs:**

  Act/Event                                      Outcome
1. NMC Act, 2019                               :  Repealed the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956
2. NMC getting WFME recognition for 10 years : All existing and new medical colleges become WFME accredited.
3. NNMC Act, 2023                               :  Seeks to repeal the Dentists Act, 1948
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NMC Act, 2019, did indeed repeal the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, making pair 1 correct. The NMC receiving WFME recognition for 10 years did result in all existing and new medical colleges becoming WFME accredited within that timeframe, making pair 2 correct. However, the NNMC Act, 2023, pertains to nursing and midwifery, not the repeal of the Dentists Act, 1948 (which was repealed by the NDC Act 2023). Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the mismatched pair 3.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

  Type of Village                                  Status Definition
1. ODF Village                                    :  Sustained ODF status with solid waste management systems
2. ODF Plus Village                               : No visible faeces found in the environment
3. ODF Plus Model Village                         : Sustained ODF status with both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness and IEC messages.
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

An ODF (Open Defecation Free) village requires the absence of visible faeces and the use of safe sanitation technologies by all households and institutions;  therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  Pair 2 is incorrect because the definition of ODF status is not the same as the description of ODF Plus. The description of an ODF Plus Model Village is accurate, making pair 3 correct. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the mismatched pairs 1 and/or 2.


**10. With reference to the  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   NCF-SE Feature                                 Description
1.  5+3+3+4 design                               :  Refers to the age groups for different stages of schooling
2.  Board Examinations                             : Students can take the exams twice a year, with the best score retained.
3.  Vocational Education                           :  Focuses on work only with machines and materials
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 5+3+3+4 design in the NCF-SE does indeed refer to the age-based structure of schooling, making pair 1 correct.  The NCF-SE does allow students to take board examinations twice a year, retaining the best score, making pair 2 correct.  However, the NCF-SE's approach to vocational education is more comprehensive, encompassing work with life forms, materials and machines, and human services; therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.  Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the mismatched pair 3.



**1. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Area                          Specific Provision
    1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)       :   Target of 50% by 2035
    2. Undergraduate Degrees             :   Multiple exit options after each year
    3. Multidisciplinary Education        :   Establishment of MERUs across the country
    4. Research and Innovation           :   Establishment of National Research Foundation (NRF)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 explicitly aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% in higher education by 2035.  This is a clearly stated target within the policy document.  The policy also advocates for a flexible undergraduate degree structure with multiple exit options, allowing students to earn certifications, diplomas, or bachelor's degrees after completing one, two, or three years respectively, before potentially pursuing an honors degree in the fourth year.  The establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) is a core component of the NEP's vision to promote interdisciplinary learning and research. Finally, the creation of the National Research Foundation (NRF) is a key initiative to boost research and innovation across the nation.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs related to the Performance Grading Index (PGI):**

    Category                          Grade
    1. Highest Grade Achieved          :   Daksh
    2. Lowest Grade Achieved           :   Akanshi-3
    3. States/UTs Achieving Prachesta-2 :   Punjab and Chandigarh
    4. Data Source for PGI              :   UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Performance Grading Index (PGI) uses a ten-grade system, with 'Daksh' representing the highest grade and 'Akanshi-3' the lowest.  Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the 'Prachesta-2' grade in PGI 2.0 for 2021-22. The PGI assessment utilizes data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) for 2021-22 and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021.  All the given pairs accurately reflect information from the PGI reports.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**3. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbU) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulation/Provision                  Description
    1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 :   Supersedes 2019 regulations
    2. Eligibility for DtbU status          :   Institutions less than 20 years old can apply
    3. Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)    :   Compulsory creation of ABC identities for students
    4.  Granting of DtbU status           :  Power vested in the Central Government under Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, replaced the 2019 regulations. A significant change introduced in the 2023 regulations is that institutions less than 20 years old are now eligible to apply for DtbU status. The new regulations mandate the creation of Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for all students in DtbUs.  Finally, the power to grant DtbU status rests with the Central Government, as explicitly stated in Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956.  Hence, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**4. With reference to Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Requirement/Restriction             Description
    1.  Establishment of Campuses       : Requires UGC approval
    2. Programme Offerings              : Cannot offer programmes contrary to Indian standards
    3. Eligibility for Entry               : Ranked within top 500 globally or possessing outstanding expertise

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UGC regulations clearly stipulate that FHEIs need UGC approval before establishing campuses in India. They are also restricted from offering programs that violate Indian higher education standards.  Eligibility criteria for FHEIs include being ranked among the top 500 globally or demonstrating exceptional expertise in a specific field.  Importantly, online or distance learning modes are not permitted for FHEIs operating in India.  Therefore, all four pairs are accurate representations of the regulations governing FHEIs in India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and hence incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs relating to the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

    Framework Component                 Description

    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF organizes educational levels, with levels 1-4 corresponding to school education and levels 4.5-8 to higher education.  A key goal of the NCrF is the integration of credits earned through various educational pathways, encompassing the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and the National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF). The framework establishes a standard of 1200 notional learning hours per year across different educational streams.  All pairs are thus correctly matched according to the NCrF report.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**6. With reference to the  National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following pairs:**

    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 update of the National Indicator Framework (NIF) comprises 284 indicators. The Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) is indeed composed of member states and international organizations acting as observers. The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) currently includes 248 indicators.  Finally, the NIF was initially developed by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) in 2018.  Therefore, all four pairs reflect accurate information related to the NIF for SDGs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and hence incorrect.


**7.  Consider the following pairs regarding  Tribal Welfare in India:**

    Category                                 Specific Example/Fact

**Explanation:**

Madhya Pradesh has the largest Scheduled Tribe (ST) population in India in absolute numbers. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs serves as the nodal ministry responsible for tribal welfare initiatives. There are 75 Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) recognized in India. Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs.  Consequently, all four pairs provided are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**8. With reference to  Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Category                                 Specific Example/Fact
    1.  Origin of the term 'Denotified'       : British Criminal Tribes Act, 1871

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The term "Denotified" originates from the British Criminal Tribes Act of 1871.  DNT communities celebrate August 31st as Vimukta Jatis Day. The National Commission for Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes is tasked with creating a state-wise list of DNT castes. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a well-known semi-nomadic group from Karnataka.  Thus, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and hence incorrect.


**9. Consider the following pairs related to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

    Provision                                   Description
    1.  Reservation in Government Jobs         : Not less than 4%
    2.  Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions: Not less than 5%
    3.  Types of Disabilities Recognized        : 21
    4. Office of Chief Commissioner for PwDs   : Established under the RPwD Act, 2016

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for persons with disabilities (PwDs) in government jobs and not less than 5% reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities. The Office of the Chief Commissioner for PwDs was established under the provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and hence incorrect.


**10. With reference to Manual Scavenging in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme/Initiative                     Description

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR Act), explicitly prohibits manual scavenging. The National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme aims to fully mechanize sanitation processes.  The PEMSR Act prescribes penalties for violations, including imprisonment and fines. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana offers financial assistance for procuring sanitation equipment.  Hence, all the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Higher Education Initiative                 Focus Area
1.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)          :  Digital storage of academic credits
2.  Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) :  Establishment of top-tier multidisciplinary institutions
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)     :  International collaborations in higher education
4.  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) :  Promotion of research and innovation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a digital platform designed to store academic credits earned by students from various institutions, facilitating greater flexibility and mobility in higher education.  Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) are a key initiative under NEP 2020 aiming to establish institutions of the highest standards in multidisciplinary education and research. The National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) is intended to be a platform for sharing knowledge and improving the application of technology in education, including learning, assessment, and administration.  However, the National Research Foundation (NRF) is primarily focused on catalyzing and expanding research and innovation across the country, not specifically on international collaborations, though such collaborations may be a component of its broader goals. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly include or exclude the NRF's focus.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI), consider the following pairs:**

    Year          Highest Grade Achieved                  State/UT Achieving Highest Grade
1. 2017-18      :  Daksh                                      Kerala
2. 2021-22      :  Prachesta – 2                              Punjab and Chandigarh
3. 2021-22      :  Akanshi – 3                                 Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram
4. 2017-18      :  Uttam                                       Tamil Nadu


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22 correctly indicates that Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade of Prachesta-2, and Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram were placed in the lowest grade of Akanshi-3.  However, the information regarding the highest grade achieved in 2017-18 and the state/UT achieving it, as well as the state/UT achieving Uttam in 2017-18, is incorrect.  The  provided data for 2017-18 is fabricated for the purpose of creating a challenging MCQ.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the false information from pair 1 or 4, or exclude the correct information from pairs 2 and 3.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Initiative                       Primary Focus
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                          :  Primary Healthcare
2.  Saksham Anganwadis                              :  Digital Infrastructure for AWCs
3.  National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan)    :  Universal Health Coverage
4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush                 :  Improved Sanitation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana, while encompassing various levels of healthcare, has a significant focus on improving access to primary healthcare services. Saksham Anganwadis are a crucial part of the government's efforts to improve the infrastructure and digital capabilities of Anganwadi Centers (AWCs).  However, the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) focuses on improving nutrition, not directly on Universal Health Coverage (UHC), although it contributes indirectly.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets immunization, not sanitation. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly associate the primary focus of the schemes with incorrect areas.


**4. With reference to Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                              State with Significant Population
1.  Bharia                              :  Chhattisgarh
2.  Baiga                               :  Madhya Pradesh
3.  Kamar                               :  Odisha
4.  Konda Reddi                         :  Andhra Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia and Baiga tribes have significant populations in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Konda Reddi tribe is predominantly found in Andhra Pradesh.  The information relating to Kamar tribe and Odisha is fabricated to create a challenging MCQ. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the false information from pair 3, or exclude the correct information from pairs 1, 2, and 4.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                 Key Provision
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Bans manual scavenging
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :  4% reservation in government jobs
3.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021            :  Allows commercial surrogacy
4.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a child as a person below 16 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly prohibits the practice of manual scavenging. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs. However, the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, allows only altruistic surrogacy and penalizes commercial surrogacy. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a child as a person below 18 years of age. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of the key provisions of the Surrogacy Act and the Juvenile Justice Act.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                                    State with Highest PVTG Population
1.  Bharia                               :   Madhya Pradesh
2.  Baiga                                :   Chhattisgarh
3.  Kamar                               :   Odisha
4.  Various PVTGs                         :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is indeed listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) and Madhya Pradesh has a significant population of this tribe.  However, the other options present inaccuracies. While Chhattisgarh has a population of Baiga, Odisha is not the state with the highest number of Kamar PVTGs.  The statement about Andaman and Nicobar Islands having the highest number of PVTGs is also incorrect; Odisha holds that distinction.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The question tests factual recall related to PVTG distribution across Indian states.  Understanding the nuances of PVTG categorization and their geographical distribution is crucial for comprehending India's tribal welfare policies and challenges.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect distractors makes the question challenging, requiring precise knowledge of tribal demographics.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                                       Ministry
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013   :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)   :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)          :   Ministry of Rural Development
4.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls    :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. This ministry is responsible for the welfare and rehabilitation of manual scavengers.  However, the other options are incorrect. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is not under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is also not under the Ministry of Rural Development, and the Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship is not under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The question tests the understanding of the governmental structure responsible for social welfare schemes in India.  The correct identification of the ministry responsible for each scheme demonstrates a grasp of the division of labor within the government and the specific focus of each ministry. The incorrect options provide plausible but ultimately inaccurate ministry assignments, highlighting the need for precise knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                      Key Provision/Focus
1.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016    :   Reservation in police forces
2.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem  :   Elimination of hazardous cleaning
3.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan     :   Reduction of stunting in all districts of India
4.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), Phase II         :   ODF Plus status for 100% of Indian villages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem correctly focuses on eliminating hazardous cleaning practices, which is a key objective of the policy. However, the other statements are incorrect. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, does *not* include reservation in police forces.  The National Nutrition Mission aims to reduce stunting in districts with the highest malnutrition burden, not all districts. Finally, Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), Phase II, has not achieved ODF Plus status for 100% of Indian villages.  This question tests knowledge of specific government policies and their goals.  The accurate identification of the correct pair demonstrates an understanding of the policy's core objectives. The incorrect options include plausible but ultimately inaccurate claims, highlighting the necessity for precise knowledge of the policies' details.


**4. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

    Worker Category                          Key Role/Responsibility
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)              :   Focuses primarily on curative care and supplies
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)       :   Early childhood care and development
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) :   Promotion of Maternal and Child Health
4.  AWWs and AWHs                        :   Receive performance-linked incentives only from State Governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) is correctly paired with the promotion of Maternal and Child Health.  This is a core function of ASHAs within the public health system. However, the other pairs are incorrect. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) focus on early childhood care and development, not curative care. Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) primarily focus on maternal and child health,  and AWWs and AWHs receive performance-linked incentives from both the Centre and State Governments. This question tests knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of various community health workers in India.  Correctly identifying the ASHA's role demonstrates an understanding of the integrated approach to primary healthcare. The incorrect options highlight the need for a precise understanding of the functions and compensation structures of these workers.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                     Releasing Organization
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI)                         :   World Food Programme (WFP)
2.  Global Gender Gap Index                           :   World Economic Forum
3.  Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) :   UNICEF
4.  Path to Equal Report                              :   United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Women


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is correctly attributed to the World Economic Forum, and the Path to Equal Report is correctly linked to UNDP and UN Women.  However, the other pairs are incorrect. The Global Hunger Index is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not WFP. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is jointly released by the WHO and the World Bank, not UNICEF.  This question tests knowledge of various international indices and their releasing organizations.  Correctly identifying the releasing organizations for the Global Gender Gap Index and the Path to Equal Report demonstrates awareness of key global development indicators.  The incorrect options demonstrate the need for precise knowledge of the sources of these important reports.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

    Stage of Schooling                          Key Feature
1. Foundational Stage (ages 3-8)             :   Introduction of vocational education
2. Preparatory Stage (ages 8-11)             :   Emphasis on multilingualism
3. Middle Stage (ages 11-14)                :   Separate area of study for Environmental Education
4. Secondary Stage (ages 14-18)             :   Multiple exit options with certifications


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE correctly emphasizes multilingualism in the Preparatory Stage and introduces a separate area of study for Environmental Education in the Middle Stage. However, the other pairs are incorrect. Vocational education is introduced later in the schooling system, not at the Foundational Stage, and multiple exit options with certifications are a feature of higher education, not specifically the Secondary Stage under NCF-SE. This question assesses the understanding of the key features of the NCF-SE across different stages of schooling.  Correctly identifying the features of the Preparatory and Middle Stages demonstrates an understanding of the framework's phased approach. The incorrect options highlight the need for precise knowledge of the curriculum's design across different age groups.


**7.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                        Key Report/Publication
1.  UNFPA                                              :   Global Report on Food Crisis
2.  UNDESA                                             :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3.  UNHCR                                              :   State of World Population Report
4.  IFPRI                                               :   India Ageing Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) correctly releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Global Report on Food Crisis is published by the World Food Programme (WFP), not UNFPA. The State of World Population Report is published by UNFPA, not UNHCR. Finally, the India Ageing Report 2023 was released jointly by UNFPA and IIPS, not IFPRI.  This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their key publications.  Correctly identifying the UNDESA's report shows understanding of global development monitoring mechanisms. The incorrect options highlight the importance of accurately associating reports with their respective publishing organizations.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Higher Education Institution Classification           Defining Characteristic
1. Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs)                :   Must be older than 20 years
2. Institutions under UGC recognition                   :   Accredited by NAAC with an 8-point grading system
3. Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs)      :   Can offer online and distance learning programs without restriction
4.  Institutions ranked in top 500 globally           :   Automatically receive DTBU status


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the given pairs are incorrect.  Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) can be less than 20 years old. Institutions under UGC recognition are not solely defined by NAAC accreditation with an 8-point system, and this system itself has undergone changes. Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) have restrictions on offering online and distance learning programs. Finally, top 500 global ranking does not automatically grant DTBU status.  This question assesses knowledge of the different classifications of higher education institutions in India and their defining characteristics. The incorrectness of all options underscores the need for a precise understanding of the regulations and criteria governing each type of institution.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/Union Territory
1. Bharia PVTG                             :   Chhattisgarh only
2. Kamar PVTG                              :   Madhya Pradesh only
3. Baiga PVTG                               :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4.  A Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) with pre-agricultural technology : Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the statement that a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) with pre-agricultural technology is found in Odisha is accurate.  Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India, and a key criterion for identifying PVTGs is a pre-agricultural level of technology.  The other options are incorrect. Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making options 1 and 2 incorrect.  The Baiga tribe is not exclusively found in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; their presence extends to other states as well, making option 3 incorrect.  The question plays on the knowledge of specific PVTG locations and the broader criteria used to define them, making it a challenging question that demands precise factual recall.  The distractors are plausible because they include actual PVTGs and states where they are found, but they manipulate the distribution and exclusivity to create incorrect matches.


**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Community Characteristic                     Fact
1.  All nomadic tribes (NTs)                 : Are DNTs
2.  All DNTs                                  : Are NTs
3.  Hakki Pikki Tribe                         :  A nomadic tribal group from Karnataka
4.  The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871             :  Currently in effect

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  All Denotified Tribes (DNTs) are nomadic tribes (NTs), reflecting their historical categorization.  The Hakki Pikki are semi-nomadic, not strictly nomadic, making pair 3 incorrect.  The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, has been repealed, making pair 4 incorrect. Pair 1 is incorrect because not all nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuanced relationship between DNTs and NTs and their historical context.  The inclusion of the Hakki Pikki tribe as a distractor, while related to nomadic communities, is strategically incorrect to test deeper knowledge.  The inclusion of the repealed Criminal Tribes Act serves as another significant distractor, testing recall of relevant legislation.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                    Specific Detail
1.  Reservation in Government jobs          :  No less than 5%
2.  Reservation in Higher Education          :  No less than 4%
3.  Reservation applicable to Police Forces  :  Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police
4. Definition of "Person with benchmark disability": Less than 40% specified disability


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The Act mandates no less than 4% reservation in government jobs (not 5%), and no less than 5% reservation in higher educational institutions (not 4%).  Crucially, the reservation is *not* applicable to police forces, contradicting pair 3. The definition of "Person with benchmark disability" requires at least 40%, not less than 40%, specified disability, making pair 4 incorrect. This question tests detailed knowledge of the Act's specific provisions regarding reservations and definitions, making it difficult. The distractors are carefully crafted to be close to the correct figures, testing the candidate's ability to recall precise numerical details. The inclusion of police force reservations as a distractor effectively targets understanding of the Act's limitations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization                                  Report/Index
1.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)      :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) :   Global Food Policy Report 2023
3.  World Economic Forum                         :   Global Gender Gap Index
4.  United Nations Development Programme         :  UHC Service Coverage Index

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index.  The IFPRI releases the Global Food Policy Report, not UNHCR.  UNHCR releases reports on forced displacement, not food policy.  The UHC Service Coverage Index is released jointly by WHO and the World Bank, not UNDP. The question tests the knowledge of various international organizations and their associated reports/indices. The distractors are designed to be plausible, as they involve organizations that do release reports related to global issues, but the specific pairings are manipulated to be incorrect. This requires the candidate to have detailed knowledge of each organization's specific areas of work.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Goal                           Specific Implementation
1.  Achieve 50% GER in Higher Education by 2035 :  Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs)
2.  Multiple Exit Options in Undergraduate Degrees   :  Creation of the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)
3.  Internationalization of Education                   :  Establishment of the National Research Foundation (NRF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. NEP 2020 aims for at least 50% GER in higher education by 2035, and MERUs are a key initiative towards this goal.  Multiple exit options are facilitated by the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC).  However, pair 3 is incorrect; the internationalization of education is not directly linked to the establishment of the National Research Foundation (NRF).  The NRF primarily focuses on research and innovation.  This question tests the understanding of the NEP 2020's goals and their respective implementation strategies.  The distractors cleverly link seemingly related but distinct NEP initiatives to create plausible but ultimately incorrect pairings.  The question necessitates a nuanced grasp of the policy's specific objectives and mechanisms.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Feature
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Bans manual scavenging
2.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)                :  Focuses solely on liquid waste management
3.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system: Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning
4.  Saksham Anganwadis                             :  Exclusively targets children aged 0-3 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The 2013 Act explicitly bans manual scavenging, and the National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning.  Pair 2 is incorrect; Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) addresses both solid and liquid waste management. Pair 4 is incorrect; Saksham Anganwadis target a broader age range, including adolescent girls and children aged 0-6 years.  The question tests knowledge of specific government policies and acts related to sanitation and child welfare. The distractors are carefully chosen to include related but not entirely accurate details, requiring precise knowledge to identify the correct matches.  The inclusion of the Swachh Bharat Mission with an oversimplified description acts as a strong distractor.


**7. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Data Point                                    Value
1.  India's GHI Rank                             :  125th
2.  India's GHI Score                            :  28.7
3.  India's Child Stunting Prevalence            :  35.5%
4.  Region with Highest Hunger Levels           :  South America


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. India's GHI score in 2023 was 28.7, and the child stunting prevalence was 35.5%.  However, India's GHI rank was 111th (not 125th), and the regions with the highest hunger levels were South Asia and Africa South of the Sahara (not South America). This question tests specific numerical data from the GHI report. The inclusion of incorrect ranks and regions as distractors makes it a challenging question requiring precise recall of data points. The seemingly plausible incorrect options are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar data points.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization                                     Mandate/Focus
1.  UNFPA                                          :  Focuses primarily on combating hunger
2.  UNDESA                                         :  Works closely with governments to meet SDGs
3.  UNHCR                                          :  Dedicated to saving lives and protecting the rights of refugees
4.  GANHRI                                         :  Accredits National Human Rights Institutions based on the Paris Principles


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. UNDESA works towards achieving the SDGs, UNHCR focuses on refugees, and GANHRI accredits NHRIs.  Pair 1 is incorrect; UNFPA's focus is on sexual and reproductive health, not hunger.  The question tests knowledge of the mandates of various UN organizations.  The inclusion of UNFPA, with a seemingly plausible but incorrect mandate, acts as a crucial distractor, requiring a clear understanding of each organization's specific focus.  This highlights the need for detailed knowledge of international organizations and their areas of expertise.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Key Provision/Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021        :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy
2. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Act, 2021 : Regulates ART clinics and banks
3. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (as amended 2021) : Permits abortion up to 24 weeks for all women
4. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Bans manual scavenging and mandates rehabilitation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, significantly restricts surrogacy practices in India, permitting only altruistic surrogacy, thereby prohibiting commercial surrogacy.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Act, 2021, aims to regulate and standardize the functioning of ART clinics and banks, ensuring ethical practices and preventing misuse. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, comprehensively addresses the issue of manual scavenging, prohibiting the practice and mandating the rehabilitation of those previously engaged in it.  Option (d) is incorrect because while the MTP Act allows abortion under certain conditions, the 2021 amendment extended the permissible limit to 24 weeks for all women, and not just the conditions previously specified.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to Child Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                 Specific Focus
1. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :  Defines a child as someone below 18 years of age
2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme : Rehabilitation of child labourers
3.  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 : Governs inter-country adoptions of orphaned children
4.  CARINGS portal                           :  Registers Orphaned-Abandoned-Surrendered (OAS) children


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a child as a person below 18 years, establishing the legal framework for juvenile justice. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme focuses on the rehabilitation of child labourers, providing educational and vocational opportunities. The CARINGS portal is a crucial tool for tracking and managing the adoption process for Orphaned, Abandoned, and Surrendered (OAS) children.  Option (d) is incorrect because the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, primarily deals with adoptions within the Hindu community and does not govern inter-country adoptions of orphaned children; that falls under the purview of the Juvenile Justice Act and associated regulations. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.



**3. With reference to the empowerment of women in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Legislation/Policy                             Objective/Provision
1. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 : Establishes Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs)
2.  Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023 : Aims for stigma-free menstruation experiences
3.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021      :  Allows surrogacy for single women using donor sperm
4.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 : Defines domestic violence broadly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, is a landmark legislation that establishes Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) to address sexual harassment complaints. The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, aims to create a stigma-free environment surrounding menstruation and promote hygiene practices. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provides a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing various forms of abuse.  Option (d) is incorrect because the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, while allowing surrogacy for certain couples, doesn't explicitly permit it for single women using donor sperm; the regulations are stricter. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the education sector in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Framework                                  Key Feature
1. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020         :  Introduces a 5+3+3+4 curricular structure
2. Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023 :  Repealed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008
3. National Credit Framework (NCrF)             :  Integrates credits from school, higher education, and vocational training
4. National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) :  Focuses solely on the foundational stage of education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, a significant reform in Indian education, introduces a new 5+3+3+4 curricular structure, reorganizing the schooling system. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, establishes a new research framework, effectively subsuming and repealing the earlier Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to create a unified system for accumulating and transferring credits earned across different educational pathways, including school, higher education, and vocational training. Option (d) is incorrect because the NCF-SE is a comprehensive framework covering all stages of school education, not just the foundational stage. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to  Organizations related to Social Issues, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Mandate/Function
1. UNFPA                                         :  Focuses on sexual and reproductive health
2.  IFPRI                                         :  Conducts research on food security and nutrition
3.  UNHCR                                        :  Assists refugees and asylum seekers
4.  GANHRI                                        :  Accredits National Human Rights Institutions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is a leading agency dedicated to promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights globally. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is a prominent research institution focused on food security, nutrition, and agricultural development. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the UN agency responsible for protecting refugees and assisting displaced persons worldwide. The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) plays a critical role in accrediting and strengthening national human rights institutions based on international standards. All four pairs accurately reflect the mandates and functions of these organizations.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to Vulnerable Sections in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Group                                         Key Characteristic/Issue
1. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                     :  Historically labelled as "criminal tribes"
2.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :  Typically characterized by pre-agricultural technology
3.  Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)              :  Entitled to 4% reservation in government jobs
4. Children                                       :  Protected under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Denotified Tribes (DNTs) were historically categorized as "criminal tribes" under British colonial rule, facing significant social and economic marginalization.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) are characterized by their relatively primitive technology and vulnerable socio-economic conditions. Children in India are comprehensively protected under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Option (d) is incorrect because while Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) are entitled to reservation in government jobs, the percentage is 4%, not always 5%, depending on the nature of the job and specific government policies. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to Government Initiatives related to Health and Nutrition, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                       Goal/Feature
1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                        :  Provides health insurance coverage
2.  POSHAN Abhiyan                               :  Focuses on improving maternal and child nutrition
3.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush             :  Aims for 100% vaccination coverage
4.  National Family Health Survey (NFHS)          :  Conducts regular surveys on health indicators


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a major health insurance scheme aimed at providing financial protection to vulnerable populations against health emergencies. POSHAN Abhiyan is a flagship program focused on improving the nutritional status of pregnant women, mothers, and children. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) is a large-scale, nationally representative survey that collects data on various health indicators. Option (d) is incorrect because while Intensified Mission Indradhanush aims to improve vaccination coverage, it doesn't explicitly guarantee 100% coverage due to various logistical and societal factors. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to Sanitation and Hygiene in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                             Objective/Outcome
1. Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)             :  Achieved ODF status in many villages
2.  ODF Plus                                      :  Includes solid and liquid waste management
3.  NAMASTE scheme                               :  Promotes mechanized sanitation
4.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013 :  Focuses solely on urban sanitation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) has been instrumental in achieving Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in numerous villages across India. ODF Plus goes beyond basic sanitation, incorporating solid and liquid waste management. The National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme specifically promotes the use of mechanization in sanitation services to reduce manual intervention and improve safety. Option (d) is incorrect because the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, addresses manual scavenging across both rural and urban areas, not just urban areas. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Index                                      Organization/Body
1. Global Gender Gap Index                :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index             :   World Economic Forum
3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index : World Bank and WHO
4. Path to Equal Report                     :   UN Women and UNDP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.  The Gender Social Norms Index is indeed released by the United Nations Development Programme. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is a joint effort of the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO). Finally, the Path to Equal Report is a collaborative project between UN Women and UNDP. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.  Understanding the specific organizations responsible for creating and publishing these indices is crucial for comprehending global efforts in gender equality and health outcomes. This question tests factual recall and the ability to discern correct pairings from a list of plausible distractors.


**2. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

Policy Feature                                       Specific Target/Goal
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education  :   At least 50% by 2035
2. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                     :   To store academic credits earned from various institutions digitally
3. Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) : To set up only in metropolitan cities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 does indeed aim for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is designed to digitally store academic credits earned across different institutions. However, the statement regarding MERUs being established only in metropolitan cities is incorrect; the policy aims to establish them across the country.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the false statement about MERU locations. This question tests factual recall about the NEP 2020 and the ability to identify inaccuracies in provided information, showcasing analytical and evaluative skills.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Tribal Group Category                     State with Highest Number
1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)              :   Odisha
3.  Scheduled Tribes (STs) in absolute numbers :   Chhattisgarh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While Madhya Pradesh has a large ST population, Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs.  The statement regarding DNTs is also incorrect; the provided text does not specify a single state with the highest number of DNTs.  Finally, Madhya Pradesh, not Chhattisgarh, has the highest population of STs in absolute numbers. This makes all three pairs incorrectly matched.  All options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect.  This question challenges the candidate's factual knowledge on tribal demographics in India and their ability to identify incorrect pairings, emphasizing factual recall and analytical skills.



**4. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following pairs:**

Act Provision                                  Description
1. Defining Manual Scavengers               :   Includes Safal karamcharis
2. Measures to Prevent Manual Scavenging :   Demolishing insanitary latrines
3. Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers      :   Providing financial help only



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PEMSR Act does indeed define manual scavengers to include Safal karamcharis (sweepers/cleaning workers). The Act also mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines as a key measure to prevent manual scavenging. However, the rehabilitation aspect is broader than just financial help; it encompasses training in alternative employment and assistance with property purchase. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either exclude correct pairings or include incorrect ones. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the PEMSR Act's provisions, testing factual recall and the ability to evaluate the accuracy of descriptive statements related to the act.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization/Body                                   Report/Index
1. UNFPA                                             :   Global Hunger Index
2. UNDESA                                            :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report
3. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) does not release the Global Hunger Index; that is the work of Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) correctly releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) does not publish the UNHCR's report on forced displacement.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various international organizations and their respective publications, emphasizing factual recall and analytical skills.


**6. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following pairs:**

POSH Act Provision                                 Description
1. Definition of Sexual Harassment                 :   Includes showing pornography
2. Grievance Redressal Mechanism                 :   Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) mandatory in organizations with 10 or more employees
3. Appeal Process                                   :   Appeal to the police only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1,2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act does define sexual harassment to include showing pornography.  It also mandates the formation of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in organizations with 10 or more employees. However, the appeal process is not limited to the police; an appeal can be made to a court if either the aggrieved woman or the respondent is dissatisfied.  Therefore only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude a correctly matched pair or include an incorrectly matched pair. This question assesses the candidate's detailed knowledge of the POSH Act's provisions, testing their factual recall and analytical abilities.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy                                  Key Feature/Provision
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021        :   Allows commercial surrogacy
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :   Allows termination up to 24 weeks in all cases
3. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 :   Defines domestic violence to include only physical abuse


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. The MTP Act, while amended in 2021, does not allow termination up to 24 weeks in all cases; there are specific categories and gestational limits.  The PWDVA, 2005, defines domestic violence far more comprehensively than just physical abuse; it includes emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. Therefore, all three pairs are incorrectly matched.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of key legislation related to women's rights and reproductive health, emphasizing factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in provided information.  The high difficulty level arises from the need for precise knowledge of the legislation's details.


**8.  With reference to  Government Initiatives related to Child Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                     Ministry/Organization
1. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme :   Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
2. PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal :   Ministry of Labour and Employment
3. Bachpan Bachao Andolan                    :    Government-run organization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PENCiL portal is indeed managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment.  However, the NCLP scheme falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  Bachpan Bachao Andolan is a non-governmental organization (NGO), not a government-run entity. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's awareness of government initiatives concerning child welfare and their ability to correctly associate them with the relevant ministries or organizations.  The inclusion of an NGO as a distractor adds to the complexity.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                     State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                       :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Kamar PVTG                        :   Chhattisgarh
3. Baiga PVTG                         :   Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
4. Hakki Pikki Tribe                  :   Karnataka
5. Konda Reddis Tribe                :   Andhra Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all recognized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  The Bharia and Baiga tribes are found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, while the Kamar tribe is primarily located in Chhattisgarh.  The Hakki Pikki are a semi-nomadic tribe residing in Karnataka. The Konda Reddis are a tribal group found in Andhra Pradesh. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly pair at least one tribal group with its state/UT location, demonstrating a lack of precise knowledge about the geographical distribution of these groups.  The question tests factual recall and requires precise knowledge of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups within India.  Understanding the PVTG categorization is also crucial for answering this question correctly.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                  Ministry/Organization
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013  : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme : Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal : Ministry of Labour and Employment
4.  Swachhta Udyami Yojana                     : Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
5.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The PENCiL portal is managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Swachhta Udyami Yojana is associated with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of Swachhta Udyami Yojana. Option (c) is incorrect because it misattributes the NCLP and POSHAN Abhiyan to the wrong ministries. Option (d) is incorrect as it incorrectly links POSHAN Abhiyan to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) is a multi-ministerial initiative, but its primary implementation and oversight are not solely under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the governmental structure and responsibilities in India related to social welfare schemes.


**3. With reference to Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Initiative                             Description
1.  PVTGs                                          :  Groups with pre-agricultural technology and declining populations
2.  PM JANMAN                                     :  A multi-ministry initiative aiming for saturation of PVTG households with basic facilities
3.  Panchsheel Principles for Tribal Development :  Emphasize respecting tribal land rights and avoiding the imposition of alien values
4.  International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples :  Observed annually on August 9th
5.  Scheduled Tribes (STs)                        : Defined by the President through public notification

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. PVTGs (Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups) are characterized by pre-agricultural technology and often show declining or stagnant populations. PM JANMAN is a comprehensive program designed to improve the living conditions of PVTGs. The Panchsheel Principles highlight the importance of respecting tribal traditions and autonomy. International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed on August 9th.  Scheduled Tribes are legally defined by the President of India through public notification. All options except (c) miss at least one correct pairing, demonstrating an incomplete understanding of key concepts and initiatives related to tribal welfare in India. This question tests factual recall, understanding of definitions, and knowledge of government schemes.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                     Key Provision/Focus
1.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :  Allows only altruistic surrogacy
2.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 : Regulates ART clinics and banks
3.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :  Allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women
4.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Bans manual scavenging
5.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a child as a person below 18 years of age


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. The Surrogacy Act of 2021 prohibits commercial surrogacy and allows only altruistic surrogacy. The ART Act regulates the assisted reproductive technology sector. The MTP Act, although amended, allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women. The Manual Scavengers Act bans the practice. The Juvenile Justice Act defines a child as someone below 18.  Incorrect options show a lack of detailed knowledge of specific Indian laws relating to social issues. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of specific legislation.


**5. With reference to Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Provision                                   Specific Feature
1.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016     :  Recognizes 21 types of disabilities
2.  Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD             :  Mandated to safeguard the rights of PwDs
3.  RPwD Act 2016                                  :  Provides for 4% reservation in government jobs (excluding police forces)
4.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system : Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks
5.  The Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995          : Predecessor to the RPwD Act 2016


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are accurately matched. The RPwD Act of 2016 broadened the definition of disability to include 21 categories. The Office of the Chief Commissioner plays a crucial role in protecting the rights of PwDs. The act mandates a reservation of 4% in government jobs (excluding specific forces). The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation aims to prevent manual scavenging deaths. The 1995 Act was the predecessor to the 2016 Act.  Incorrect answers reflect a lack of comprehensive knowledge about the legislation and provisions related to the rights of PwDs in India. The question tests factual recall and understanding of legislative frameworks.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Community                     State(s) with Significant Presence
1.  Poumai Naga Tribe                  :   Mizoram and Nagaland
2.  Konyak Tribe                       :   Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur
3.  Irula Tribe                         :   Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
4.  Agariya Community                 :   Chhattisgarh and Odisha
5.  Maldhari Community                :   Gujarat and Rajasthan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Poumai Naga Tribe is primarily located in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh, not Mizoram and Nagaland.  The Konyak tribe is primarily in Nagaland, not Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur. The Irula tribe is found in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala, not Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The Agariya and Maldhari communities are correctly matched with their respective states.  The Agariya community has a significant presence in Chhattisgarh and Odisha, while the Maldhari community is largely found in Gujarat and Rajasthan.  Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings, making (c) the only accurate choice.  This question tests factual recall regarding the geographical distribution of various tribal and community groups in India, a crucial aspect of understanding India's social diversity.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Feature
1.  Forest Rights Act, 2006                     :   Grants habitat rights to Baiga tribe in Odisha only
2.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Mandates the construction of only insanitary latrines
3.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Excludes police forces from reservation provisions
4.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :   Allows commercial surrogacy for foreign nationals
5.  The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 :   Focuses solely on economic empowerment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Forest Rights Act, 2006 grants habitat rights to various PVTGs including the Baiga tribe, but not exclusively in Odisha; they are also present in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act aims to prevent manual scavenging and mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines, not their construction. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, correctly mentions the exclusion of certain police forces from reservation provisions. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 prohibits commercial surrogacy, including for foreign nationals. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act addresses various forms of atrocities, not just economic empowerment. Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched. This question assesses the understanding of specific features of various acts and policies related to social justice and welfare in India.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the legislation rather than a general understanding.


**3. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic                                   Description
1.  Technological Level                          :   Post-agricultural
2.  Literacy Rate                               :   High
3.  Population Trend                             :   Rapidly increasing
4.  Economic Status                             :   Financially prosperous
5.  Geographical Distribution                   :   Concentrated in only one state


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs are characterized by a pre-agricultural level of technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  They are also spread across multiple states.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the defining characteristics of PVTGs.  The incorrect options are designed to challenge the candidate's knowledge by providing plausible but ultimately inaccurate descriptions. The high difficulty is due to the need for precise knowledge of PVTG characteristics.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Initiative                     Primary Focus
1.  PM JANMAN                                      :   Urban sanitation improvement
2.  Saksham Anganwadis                             :   Exclusively for children with disabilities
3.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II      :   Achieving 100% ODF Plus status in all villages
4.  National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan)  :   Reducing malnutrition solely through school meals
5.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                         :   Providing tertiary healthcare only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PM JANMAN focuses on improving basic amenities and healthcare for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), not urban sanitation. Saksham Anganwadis aim to strengthen Anganwadi Centres for holistic child development, including children with disabilities, but not exclusively. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II aims to achieve ODF Plus status in a significant portion of villages, not 100%.  The National Nutrition Mission addresses malnutrition through various interventions, not solely school meals. Ayushman Bharat Yojana provides health coverage across primary, secondary, and tertiary care levels.  Only Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II has a partially correct matching, making (a) the correct option. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various government schemes and their specific objectives.  The distractors are designed to be plausible but ultimately incorrect, requiring a nuanced understanding of the schemes.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Aspect                                     Target/Goal
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education :   100% by 2030
2.  Multiple Exit Options in Undergraduate Degrees :   Only Diploma and Bachelor's degree
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)             :   To solely fund research in natural sciences
4.  National Credit Framework (NCrF)               :   To exclude vocational education
5.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                  :   To store only school-level academic credits


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, not 100% by 2030. Multiple exit options include certificates, diplomas, Bachelor's degrees, and Honours degrees. The NRF aims to support research across various disciplines, not just natural sciences. The NCrF integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education. The ABC stores credits earned from various educational and skill development programs.  Hence, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's in-depth understanding of NEP 2020 and its various components.  The distractors are carefully chosen to represent common misconceptions or partial understandings of the policy.  The question demands precise factual knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                         State/UT
1. Bharia                          Madhya Pradesh
2. Kamar                           Chhattisgarh
3. Baiga                            Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4. Konda Reddis                     Odisha
5. Chenchus                        Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Madhya Pradesh.  The Kamar and Baiga tribes are also recognized as PVTGs, with presence in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  The Konda Reddis are a tribal group mentioned in the context of nomadic communities, primarily residing in Odisha. The Chenchus are another nomadic group, but their primary residence is in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, not Karnataka.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pairing. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the Konda Reddis. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly paired Chenchus.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs                  Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology        :   Use of advanced farming techniques
2. Low level of literacy                       :  High literacy rates exceeding national average
3. Economic backwardness                    :   High per capita income and economic prosperity
4. Declining or stagnant population          :   Rapid population growth and expansion

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are the opposite of what is described in each pair. PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural technology (not advanced), low literacy (not high), economic backwardness (not prosperity), and a declining or stagnant population (not rapid growth). Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nomadic/Semi-Nomadic Tribe        Primary Location
1. Hakki Pikki                        :    Odisha
2. Gujjars                             :    Karnataka
3. Banjaras                            :    West Bengal
4. Pardis                              :    Rajasthan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) Only 4
(d) Only 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group primarily located in Karnataka, not Odisha.  Gujjars are a pastoral nomadic community largely found in Rajasthan and several other states, making Rajasthan a plausible location.  Banjaras are another pastoral community, but their main presence is in Central and South India, not West Bengal. Pardis are also a nomadic group, and their primary location is Rajasthan. Thus, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                  Specification
1. Reservation in Government jobs         :   Not less than 2%
2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions: Not less than 10%
3.  Recognition of Disabilities           :   15 types of disabilities recognized
4. Free Education for Children with Benchmark Disabilities: Age group 4-16 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Act mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs, not 2%.  It also specifies not less than 5% reservation in higher educational institutions, not 10%.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 15. Free education is provided for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6 to 18 years, not 4 to 16 years.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                         Ministry
1.  SEED                               :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  PM JANMAN                          :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
4.  Swachhta Udyami Yojana           :   Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  PM JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan) is primarily associated with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, not the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, is primarily implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana is connected to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, not solely one ministry.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                     Specification
1.  Schooling Structure                     :   4+3+3+4
2. Board Examinations for Grades 10 and 12 :   One attempt per year
3.  Languages                               :   Proficiency in at least two Indian languages
4. Vocational Education                     :   Focus on only work with machines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, not 4+3+3+4.  Board examinations are allowed on at least two occasions per year, not just one.  The framework emphasizes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.  Vocational education encompasses work with life forms, materials and machines, and human services, not solely work with machines.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Global Index/Report                       Releasing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index                :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index             :   World Economic Forum
3. UHC Service Coverage Index             :   World Health Organization and World Bank
4. Path to Equal Report                    :   International Monetary Fund

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.  The Gender Social Norms Index is indeed released by the UNDP. The UHC Service Coverage Index is jointly released by the World Health Organization and the World Bank. The Path to Equal Report is a joint publication of UN Women and UNDP, not the IMF. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                  Specification
1.  Levels of Education                   :  Integrated into a 6-level system
2. Credit Accumulation                    : Stored in the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) database
3.  Notional Learning Hours per year     :  1500 hours
4. Integration of Frameworks           : Includes the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF divides education into an 8-level system, not 6. Credits are stored in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC), not the NSQF database. The total notional learning hours per year is 1200, not 1500. The NCrF does integrate the NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                           :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
2. UNDESA                          :   India Ageing Report 2023
3. UNCRC                           :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition
4. IFPRI                            :   Global Report on Food Crisis
5. WFP                             :   Global Food Policy Report 2023: Rethinking food crisis responses

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) releases the State of World Population report, not the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report." That report is published by the UNHCR.  The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) does not release the "India Ageing Report 2023"; this report is published by the UNFPA in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS). The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) focuses on children's rights and does not publish the SDG progress report; that is the purview of the UNDESA.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) publishes the Global Food Policy Report, not the Global Report on Food Crisis; the latter is published by the World Food Programme (WFP). Therefore, only pair 2, linking UNDESA with the India Ageing Report 2023, is correctly matched.


**2. With reference to  Government Initiatives for Child Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                       Description
1.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme     :   Managed by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  PENCiL Portal                    :   A tool for rescuing and rehabilitating child labour victims
3.  Bachpan Bachao Andolan           :   A government initiative to combat child trafficking
4.  CARA                             :   A statutory body governing inter-country adoptions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal is indeed a crucial tool for rescuing and rehabilitating child labour victims. Bachpan Bachao Andolan is a prominent NGO, not a government initiative. CARA (Central Adoption Resource Authority) accurately functions as the nodal body for inter-country adoptions.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                        Key Provision/Feature
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 :   Allows commercial surrogacy
2.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :   Defines domestic violence exclusively as physical abuse
3.  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 :   Mandates Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in workplaces with fewer than 10 employees
4.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Does not define manual scavenging

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, encompasses various forms of abuse, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013, mandates ICCs in workplaces with 10 or more employees; smaller workplaces fall under the purview of Local Committees. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, provides a clear definition of manual scavenging.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to  Organizations and their Reports, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Report Published
1.  World Food Programme (WFP)     :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2.  UNHCR                           :   Global Food Policy Report 2023
3.  IFPRI                            :   State of World Population Report 2023
4.  UNFPA                           :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The World Food Programme (WFP) publishes the Global Report on Food Crises, not the forced displacement report. The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) publishes reports on refugee displacement, not the Global Food Policy Report. The IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) publishes food policy reports, not the State of World Population Report. The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) publishes the State of World Population Report, not the SDG progress report.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Policy/Scheme     Focus Area
1.  Boeing Sukanya Program      :   Promoting women in the aviation sector
2.  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 :   Improving sanitation in schools
3.  Samagra Shiksha             :   Developing a National Credit Framework
4.  National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) :   Improving quality of higher education institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Boeing Sukanya Program is specifically designed to encourage girls' participation in the aviation sector.  NEP 2020 focuses on overall educational reform, not solely on school sanitation. Samagra Shiksha is a comprehensive education scheme, but its primary focus isn't the National Credit Framework. NDEAR (National Digital Education Architecture) aims to improve digital infrastructure for education, not directly the quality of higher education institutions. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**6. With reference to  Acts and their Objectives, consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                     Objective
1.  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 :   To define and regulate hazardous occupations for adolescents
2.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015   :   To establish a National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)
3.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005     :   To criminalize marital rape
4.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   To completely eradicate manual scavenging by 2020


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour Act, 2016, indeed addresses hazardous occupations for adolescents. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, while establishing mechanisms for child protection, does not directly establish the NCPCR; it already existed.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provides civil remedies but does not criminalize marital rape.  The Manual Scavengers Act aims at rehabilitation and prevention but didn't set a target date for complete eradication. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                    Organization/Body
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI)      :   IFPRI
2.  Global Gender Gap Index        :   World Bank
3.  National Family Health Survey (NFHS) :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
4.  UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) :   UNHCR

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is indeed published by IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute). The Global Gender Gap Index is published by the World Economic Forum, not the World Bank. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) is correctly linked to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) is a joint initiative of the WHO and World Bank, not the UNHCR. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to  Government Bodies and their Mandates, consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                  Mandate
1.  National Medical Commission (NMC) :   Regulating paramedical education
2.  National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) :   Regulating dental education
3.  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) :   Assessing child suspects in heinous offences
4.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) :   Accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) globally

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NMC (National Medical Commission) does regulate medical education, which includes aspects related to paramedical professions. The NNMC (National Nursing and Midwifery Commission) is responsible for nursing and midwifery, not dental education.  The NCPCR (National Commission for Protection of Child Rights) does issue guidelines for assessing child suspects. The NHRC (National Human Rights Commission) does not accredit NHRIs globally; that is the role of GANHRI. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Village                   Defining Characteristic
1.  ODF Plus Village                :   Sustained ODF status and solid waste management system only
2.  ODF Plus Model Village          :   Sustained ODF status, solid and liquid waste management, and visual cleanliness
3.  ODF Village                     :   Sustained ODF status, solid waste management system, and IEC messages

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

An ODF Plus village needs to maintain ODF status and implement either solid or liquid waste management systems.  An ODF Plus Model Village requires sustained ODF status, arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and ODF Plus IEC messages.  There is no mention of an "ODF Village" with the characteristics described in option 3. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Committee/Body                      Report/Recommendation
1.  Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee    :   Reforms in the accreditation system of HEIs
2.  Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education :   Implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 in Higher Education
3.  Idate Commission                    :   Setting up a permanent commission for De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes
4.  High-Level Committee (2021)        :   National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee focused on higher education accreditation reforms. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education indeed submitted a report on NEP 2020 implementation in higher education. The Idate Commission's recommendations concerned DNTs. The 2021 High-Level Committee was responsible for developing the National Credit Framework, not the NCF-SE. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Group                      State/UT with Significant Presence
1. Bharia PVTG                        Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                         Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga Tribe                          Odisha
4. Hakki Pikki Tribe                   Karnataka
5. Konda Reddis                       Andaman and Nicobar Islands


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Hakki Pikki Tribe is a semi-nomadic tribal group primarily from Karnataka, making pair 4 correct.  However, the Konda Reddis are not significantly associated with the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; their presence is primarily in Andhra Pradesh. The Baiga tribe also has a substantial presence in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, not just Odisha.  Hence, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Category of Tribal Group            Characteristic
1. PVTGs                               Pre-agricultural technology
2. DNTs                                  Notified as 'born criminal' under British rule
3. Nomadic Tribes                        Seasonal physical movement for livelihood
4. Semi-Nomadic Tribes                 Hunter/trappers of birds and animals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs (Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups) are characterized by pre-agricultural levels of technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and declining/stagnant populations. Denotified Tribes (DNTs) were historically labeled as "born criminals" during British rule. Nomadic Tribes are defined by frequent, usually seasonal, movement for livelihood. While some semi-nomadic tribes may include hunter-gatherers, this is not the sole defining characteristic.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to government initiatives for tribal welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                      Ministry/Department
1.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric Scholarship   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  SEED (Scheme for Economic Empowerment) Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3.  National Commission for DNTs           Ministry of Home Affairs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship scheme is indeed administered under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  The SEED scheme is also under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes is under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                   Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs          4%
2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions 5%
3.  Recognized Disabilities                   21 types
4.  Accessibility Mandate for Government Offices  Relocation to ground floor or accessible location within the same facility

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs and not less than 5% reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions for persons with disabilities. The act recognizes 21 types of disabilities.  Landmark judgments under the Act emphasize that government offices must ensure accessibility, either by relocating services to the ground floor or to an accessible location within the same building. Therefore, all pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013  :   Punishment of up to 5 years imprisonment
2. Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin)                 :    ODF Plus status for villages
3. National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem :   Elimination of hazardous cleaning

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment and a fine of ₹1 lakh, not 5 years.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) has indeed promoted ODF Plus status for villages. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of NCF-SE                                   Feature
1. Schooling Structure                             :   5+3+3+4 design
2. Language Proficiency                           :   Proficiency in at least four languages
3. Board Examinations                             :   Students allowed to take board exams thrice in a year
4. Vocational Education                          :    Engagement in work with life forms, materials, and human services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE adopts a 5+3+3+4 design for schooling.  It emphasizes proficiency in at least three languages, not four. While board exams are allowed on at least two occasions, not three,  the NCF-SE does advocate for vocational education encompassing work with life forms, materials, and human services. Thus, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                      :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement
2. UNDESA                                     :   Sustainable Development Goals Progress Report
3. UNHCR                                      :   State of World Population Report
4. IFPRI                                       :   Global Food Policy Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) releases the State of World Population report, not the forced displacement report. UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) publishes the Sustainable Development Goals Progress Report. UNHCR (UN High Commissioner for Refugees) issues the Global Trends: Forced Displacement report. IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) releases the Global Food Policy Report. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry/Department                           Scheme/Initiative
1. Ministry of Women and Child Development   :   NAMASTE Scheme
2. Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment :   Anganwadi Services Scheme
3. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs       :   Poshan Abhiyan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NAMASTE scheme is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The Anganwadi Services Scheme falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Poshan Abhiyan is also under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                        Key Parameter
1. Global Gender Gap Index                   :   Political Empowerment
2. Gender Social Norms Index                 :   Physical Integrity
3. UHC Service Coverage Index                :   Infectious Diseases
4. Women’s Empowerment Index                :   Global Gender Parity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index, published annually by the World Economic Forum, indeed includes Political Empowerment as one of its four key parameters.  The Gender Social Norms Index, released by the United Nations Development Programme, assesses various dimensions, including Physical Integrity. The UHC Service Coverage Index, a joint effort by the WHO and World Bank, tracks several indicator categories, with Infectious Diseases being a prominent one. The Women’s Empowerment Index, however, focuses solely on women's power and freedoms and does *not* directly measure Global Gender Parity; that's a separate index (Global Gender Parity Index). Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, while option 4 is incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking                                     Institution Ranked
1. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 :   Anna University
2. ‘Global 2000’ 2023 report                  :   Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore
3. QS World University Ranking, 2024           :   IIT Bombay
4.  Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024: University of Oxford


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 did include Anna University among the ranked institutions.  The ‘Global 2000’ 2023 report by the Centre for World University Rankings featured Indian universities, and while the specific ranking of IISc Bangalore isn't explicitly stated in the provided text, its inclusion in various rankings makes this pairing plausible. The QS World University Ranking, 2024, explicitly mentioned IIT Bombay's ranking. Finally, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 listed the University of Oxford.  All four pairs are correctly matched based on the provided information.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                    Key Provision
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 :   Prohibition of donor gametes
2. Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021: Regulation of ART clinics
3. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:  Rehabilitation of manual scavengers
4. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016: Reservation for PwDs in police forces


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1,2,3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, *amended* previous rules; the earlier rules did prohibit donor gametes, but the 2024 amendments introduced exceptions.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, directly addresses the regulation of ART clinics and banks. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly focuses on the rehabilitation of manual scavengers. However, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, while providing reservations for PwDs, specifically *excludes* police forces.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                   Report/Index Released
1. UNFPA                                          :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
2. UNDESA                                         :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3. IFPRI                                           :   Global Food Policy Report 2023
4. UNHCR                                          :   State of World Population Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) released the Global Food Policy Report 2023.  However, the UNFPA released the India Ageing Report 2023, not the UNHCR's report on forced displacement.  The UNHCR did release the report cited, but it is not associated with the UNFPA. The State of World Population Report 2023 is a UNFPA report, not a UNHCR report. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative                         Focus Area
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                     :   Primary Healthcare
2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)      :   National Portability of Health Services
3.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush             :   Adult Vaccination
4.  National Health Policy 2017                 :   Universal Health Coverage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to improve healthcare across all levels, including primary care, but its scope extends beyond primary healthcare alone.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) focuses on digital health infrastructure, including national portability of health services.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets children and pregnant women for immunization, not adults.  The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims to achieve Universal Health Coverage.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Act                                   Target Beneficiary Group
1.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme  :   Adolescents (14-18 years)
2.  Saksham Anganwadis                          :   Adolescent Girls (14-18 years)
3.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls :  Scheduled Castes
4.  Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana       :   Anganwadi Workers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme primarily targets children below 14 years, not adolescents. Saksham Anganwadis include adolescent girls (14-18 years) among their target beneficiaries. The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship is specifically for Denotified Tribes, not Scheduled Castes. Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana provides insurance coverage for Anganwadi Workers.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                     Key Finding/Feature
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023                :   India ranked 100th
2.  Global Gender Gap Index 2023                 :   India ranked 127th out of 146 countries
3.  UHC Service Coverage Index 2021              :   India's score declined to 63 from 64 in 2019
4.  Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report: 30% of forcefully displaced were children


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 ranked India 111th, not 100th. The Global Gender Gap Index 2023 correctly placed India at 127th out of 146 countries. The UHC Service Coverage Index 2021 accurately reflects India's score decline.  The UNHCR report on forced displacement correctly states that 30% of those displaced were children. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Mandate/Function
1.  GANHRI                                      :   Accreditation of National Human Rights Institutions
2.  UNPFII                                       :   Deals specifically with Indigenous Peoples’ issues
3.  UNCRC                                        :   Monitors implementation of UN Convention on Rights of Children
4.  NCDNT                                        :   Preparation of a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is indeed responsible for reviewing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is mandated to deal with Indigenous Peoples’ issues. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) monitors the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) was tasked with preparing a state-wise list of DNT castes.  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Educational Initiative/Act                         Key Feature
1.  NCF-SE                                         :   5+3+3+4 schooling structure
2.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023: Repealed SERB
3.  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023:  Allows institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtbU status
4.  National Credit Framework (NCrF) Report       :   Integration of NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) introduced the 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling. The Anusandhan NRF Act, 2023, subsumed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), effectively repealing it. The UGC regulations of 2023 lowered the age requirement for institutions seeking Deemed-to-be-University status. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) Report aims to integrate the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF).  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Objective/Provision
1.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971:  Allows termination up to 26 weeks under specific circumstances
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015: Defines a child as a person below 18 years of age
3.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016: Prohibits employment of children below 14 years in all employment
4.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021: Allows commercial surrogacy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The MTP Act allows termination up to 20 weeks for all and up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances, not 26 weeks. The Juvenile Justice Act correctly defines a child as a person below 18 years. The Child Labour Act correctly prohibits the employment of children below 14. The Surrogacy Act prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3, and not 4, are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is partially correct, but the timeframe is inaccurate.





**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Initiative                     Associated Ministry/Organization
1. Prayatna Project                          :   Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE)
2. National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) :   Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)
3. Samagra Shiksha                          :    Ministry of Education
4. National Curriculum Framework (NCF)     :   National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
5.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)          :    University Grants Commission (UGC)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prayatna project, a livelihood and enterprise training program for transgender people, is indeed associated with the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE).  The National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) is a collaborative initiative primarily involving the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).  Samagra Shiksha is a flagship program of the Ministry of Education. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) is developed and implemented by the NCERT.  Finally, the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a crucial component of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and its implementation and administration are largely overseen by the University Grants Commission (UGC).  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall of government initiatives and their associated ministries/organisations, crucial for understanding India's education policy landscape.

**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Related Act/Regulation          Key Feature
1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023  :  Allows institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtbU status.
2.  National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023 :  Repeals the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008.
3.  National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019  :  Established the National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC).
4.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021            :   Allows commercial surrogacy.
5.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Allows the employment of manual scavengers with protective gear.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, significantly altered the eligibility criteria for Deemed-to-be Universities, including allowing institutions less than 20 years old to apply. The National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, indeed subsumed the SERB, effectively repealing the 2008 Act. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, while prohibiting manual scavenging, makes an exception for those using protective gear.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either falsely include the incorrect pairing of the NMC Act with the NNMC or the incorrect pairing of the Surrogacy Act allowing commercial surrogacy (it only allows altruistic surrogacy), or exclude the correct matching of pairs 1,2 and 5. This question tests the ability to recall and analyze key features of different acts and regulations related to higher education, research, and social welfare in India.  Understanding the nuances of these acts is critical for comprehending the complexities of Indian governance.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Initiative             Primary Focus Area
1.  PM JANMAN                               :   Development of Scheduled Castes
2.  Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) :   Skill Development
3.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP)      :   Rehabilitation of Child Labourers
4.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) :   Welfare of De-notified Tribes
5. SMILE Scheme                              :  Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PMKVY focuses on skill development, NCLP on child labour rehabilitation, and SEED on the economic empowerment of Denotified Tribes.  PM JANMAN's focus is on the development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), not Scheduled Castes, making statement 1 incorrect. The SMILE scheme targets marginalized individuals including transgender persons and those engaged in begging, not specifically manual scavengers.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various government schemes and their target beneficiaries.  It requires recall of specific details and the ability to differentiate between closely related schemes.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Key Provision/Feature
1.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :  Allows abortion up to 24 weeks for all women.
2.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :  Mandates at least 5% reservation in government jobs for persons with disabilities.
3.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :  Defines a child as a person below 16 years of age.
4.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021      :   Allows commercial surrogacy.
5.  Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 :  Sets the age of consent at 16 years.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the statement concerning the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, is entirely accurate; it does indeed mandate a minimum of 5% reservation in government jobs for persons with disabilities.  The MTP Act allows abortion up to 20 weeks for all women and under certain conditions up to 24 weeks. The Juvenile Justice Act defines a child as a person below 18 years of age. The Surrogacy Act prohibits commercial surrogacy. The POCSO Act sets the age of consent at 18 years.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key provisions of various social welfare legislations in India, demanding precise recall of legal details.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Index                                 Releasing Organization
1. Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report :   World Food Programme (WFP)
2. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                     :   International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
3.  Global Food Policy Report 2023              :   United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
4.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress Report 2023 :   Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)
5.  India Ageing Report 2023                     :   United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index is released by IFPRI, the SDGs NIF Progress Report by MoSPI, and the India Ageing Report by UNFPA.  The Global Trends report on forced displacement is published by UNHCR, not WFP.  The Global Food Policy Report is also released by IFPRI, not UNHCR. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect, as they include incorrectly paired items. This question assesses the candidate's familiarity with various reports and indices related to social development, requiring knowledge of the organizations responsible for their release.  It highlights the importance of understanding the sources of information for evidence-based policy analysis.


**1. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Goal                                   Specific Provision
1. Achieve 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education by 2035 :   Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs)
2. Enhance research and innovation           :   Creation of Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)
3.  Promote multilingualism in education     :   Introduction of multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees
4. Leverage technology in education           :  Establishment of National Research Foundation (NRF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims to achieve a 50% GER in higher education by 2035.  This is directly linked to expanding access to higher education, a goal partially addressed through the establishment of MERUs.  The policy also strongly emphasizes multilingualism, aiming for students to be proficient in at least three languages, at least two Indian languages.  Multiple exit options in undergraduate programs enhance flexibility and cater to diverse student needs and learning paces. Options 2 and 4 are incorrect pairings. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a digital platform for storing academic credits, contributing to flexibility and mobility but not directly enhancing research and innovation as a primary objective. The National Research Foundation (NRF) is designed to catalyze and expand research and innovation, but this is not directly related to promoting multilingualism.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                          Key Feature
1. 2017-18                                    :   51% deviation between maximum and minimum scores of States/UTs
2. 2021-22                                    :   Punjab and Chandigarh attained the highest grade (Daksh)
3. 2020-21 & 2021-22 combined                :   Data used included UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021
4. 2017-18                                    :   No State/UT attained the highest grade (Daksh)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PGI report for 2017-18 showed a significant 51% deviation between the maximum and minimum scores achieved by States/UTs, indicating a large disparity in performance across regions.  Importantly, no State/UT attained the highest grade (Daksh) in 2017-18.  The combined PGI-D report for 2020-21 and 2021-22 utilized data from UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021 for a comprehensive assessment.  Option 2 is incorrect; Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade in 2021-22, but this was "Prachesta-2", not "Daksh".


**3.  Consider the following pairs related to the  National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

   Framework                                   Key Characteristic
1. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)  :   Seamless integration of credits from school, higher education, and vocational training
2. National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)          :  Focuses solely on higher education qualifications
3. National Curriculum Framework (NCF)/National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF) :  Credit accumulation and transfer system for vocational training
4. NCrF                                            :   Encompasses NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF is a meta-framework designed to integrate credits from school, higher education, and vocational education, making option 4 correct. The other options misrepresent the individual frameworks.  NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF are components within the broader NCrF structure, not separate entities with the characteristics described in options 1, 2, and 3.


**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation/Provision                       Specific Detail
1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 :   Institutions less than 20 years old are ineligible to apply for DtbU status
2. UGC Act 1956                               :   Grants the Central Government the power to declare institutions as DtbUs
3.  NCERT's DtbU status                        :   Allows NCERT to offer only postgraduate and doctoral degrees
4. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2019  :  Allows for clusters of institutions under multiple sponsoring bodies to apply for DtbU status


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UGC Act of 1956 provides the legal basis for the Central Government to grant DtbU status to eligible institutions.  The other options present inaccurate information. The 2023 regulations allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply, contradicting option 1. NCERT's DtbU status allows it to offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees, not just postgraduate and doctoral as stated in option 3. The 2019 regulations did *not* allow clusters of institutions under multiple sponsoring bodies to apply for DtbU status; this was introduced in the 2023 regulations.


**5. Consider the following pairs related to organizations involved in addressing global social issues:**

   Organization                                 Key Mandate/Focus
1. UNFPA                                        :   Focuses primarily on food security and hunger eradication
2. UNDESA                                       :   Monitors implementation of the Paris Principles for National Human Rights Institutions
3. UNCRC                                        :   Works to save lives and protect the rights of refugees
4. GANHRI                                       :   Reports on progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
5. UNHCR                                       :   Promotes sexual and reproductive health and rights

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR's primary mandate is to protect the rights and well-being of refugees.  The other pairings are incorrect. UNFPA's focus is on sexual and reproductive health and rights, not food security. UNDESA works on broader economic and social development goals, including SDGs, not solely on the Paris Principles. The UNCRC focuses on children's rights, and GANHRI accredits National Human Rights Institutions.


**6. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                          Key Finding
1. 2015                                         :   India's GHI score was 28.7
2. 2023                                         :   India ranked 111th among 125 countries
3.  2023                                         :   South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest hunger levels
4. 2015                                         :  India showed a significant improvement in its GHI score compared to previous years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 GHI report placed India at 111th out of 125 countries.  The other options contain inaccuracies. In 2015, India's GHI score was 29.2, not 28.7 (option 1). In 2023, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa had the *highest*, not lowest, hunger levels (option 3).  India's 2023 score showed slight improvement over its 2015 score, but option 4 overstates the level of improvement.


**7. Consider the following pairs related to the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin):**

   Status                                         Characteristic
1. ODF                                          :   Absence of visible faeces in the environment
2. ODF Plus                                      :   Sustained ODF status with solid waste management systems implemented

4. ODF                                          : Every household and public institution using safe sanitation technologies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs accurately describe the characteristics of ODF, ODF Plus, and ODF Plus Model Village under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin).  The definitions provided align precisely with the program's criteria.  There are no discrepancies or inaccuracies in the given pairs.


**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

    **Stage of Schooling**                 **Prominent Feature**
1. Foundational Stage (ages 3-8)        :   Introduction of vocational education
2. Preparatory Stage (ages 8-11)         :   Emphasis on multilingualism
3. Middle Stage (ages 11-14)            :   Board examinations for Grades 10 and 12
4. Secondary Stage (ages 14-18)        :   Interdisciplinary areas of study as a separate subject

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE, aligned with the NEP 2020, restructured the school education system into four stages based on age groups. The Foundational Stage (ages 3-8) focuses on holistic development, while the Preparatory Stage (ages 8-11) emphasizes foundational literacy and numeracy.  The Middle Stage (ages 11-14) builds upon this foundation, and the Secondary Stage (ages 14-18) introduces more specialized subjects.  Option (b) correctly identifies that the Preparatory stage emphasizes multilingualism and the Secondary stage includes interdisciplinary studies. Option (1) is incorrect because vocational education is introduced later, primarily at the secondary stage, though elements might be introduced earlier. Option (3) is wrong as Board examinations are for grades 10 and 12 and not at the middle stage. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the erroneous pairings of options (1) and (3).  The NCF-SE's focus on multilingualism, particularly at the Preparatory stage, reflects a commitment to India's linguistic diversity and the benefits of multilingual education. The introduction of interdisciplinary studies at the Secondary Stage aims to foster a more holistic and interconnected understanding of knowledge.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system, consider the following pairs:**

    **Year**                        **Key Highlight**
1. 2017-18                       :   Punjab and Chandigarh attained the highest grade (Daksh).
2. 2021-22                       :   Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram were in the lowest grade (Akanshi-3).
3. 2021-22                       :   Reduction in deviation between maximum and minimum scores was 51%.
4. 2017-18                       :   No states/UTs attained the highest grade (Daksh).


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PGI assesses the performance of school education systems at state and district levels.  The 2017-18 PGI report highlighted that no state/UT achieved the highest grade (Daksh), while in 2021-22, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram were placed in the lowest grade (Akanshi-3). The reduction in score deviation between states/UTs in 2021-22 was a significant improvement compared to 2017-18.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because in 2017-18, no state/UT attained the highest grade. Pair 3 is incorrect; the deviation reduction in 2021-22 was 23.8%, not 51%.  The PGI's focus on reducing disparities in educational outcomes across states and districts underscores the importance of equitable access to quality education.  The significant reduction in score deviation between 2017-18 and 2021-22 signifies progress towards this goal.


**3. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

    **Year**                      **Significant Development**
1. 2020-21                     :   Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education reached 28.4%.
2. 2021-22                     :   91 Indian universities were included in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.
3. 2023                        :   75 Indian universities were included in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GER in higher education for the 18-23 age group increased to 28.4% in 2021-22, not 2020-21.  In 2024, around 91 Indian universities featured in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, while in 2023, the number was 75.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect as the GER of 28.4% was achieved in 2021-22. Pair 3 is correct, but it's not needed to answer the question correctly. The increasing number of Indian universities in global rankings indicates a growing presence and competitiveness in the international higher education landscape. This growth reflects ongoing efforts to improve the quality and reach of higher education in India.


**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBU) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    **Regulation/Act**                   **Key Provision**
1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2019 :   Institutions less than 20 years old can apply for DtBU status.
2. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 :   Institutions must compulsorily create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for students.
3.  NCERT's DtBU status                 :    Allows NCERT to offer only undergraduate degrees.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2019, stipulated that institutions must have existed for at least 20 years to apply for DtBU status.  The 2023 regulations removed this restriction and mandated the creation of ABC identities for students.  NCERT's DtBU status allows it to offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because the 2019 regulations required a minimum of 20 years of existence. Pair 3 is incorrect because NCERT can offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees.  The changes in the DtBU regulations reflect a focus on enhancing the quality and flexibility of higher education in India.  The granting of DtBU status to NCERT signifies a significant step towards expanding its role in shaping the national education landscape.


**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

    **Framework/Level**                 **Characteristic**
1. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) :  Covers only school education.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education.  The NHEQF covers higher education, while the NSQF covers vocational and skill education. Levels 1-4 of the NCrF refer to school education, and levels 4.5-8 refer to higher education.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect; NHEQF covers higher education. Pair 3 is incorrect; levels 1-4 refer to school education. The NCrF's aim to create a seamless credit transfer system promotes flexibility and mobility within the education system. This is a significant step towards lifelong learning and personalized educational pathways.



**6. With reference to Government Initiatives to boost R&D in India, consider the following pairs:**

    **Initiative**                           **Primary Focus**

1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :   First recognized in 2006.
2. Forest Rights Act, 2006                 :   Grants habitat rights to Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes.
3. Odisha                               :   Houses the lowest number of PVTGs in India.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as PTGs and renamed in 2006. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, grants habitat rights to certain PVTGs, including Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes. Odisha houses the highest, not the lowest, number of PVTGs in India. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect; PVTGs were first recognized in 1973. Pair 3 is incorrect; Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs.  The focus on PVTGs reflects the government's commitment to protecting and empowering the most vulnerable tribal communities. The Forest Rights Act is a crucial instrument in securing their land and forest rights.


**8. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    **Commission/Act**                    **Key Recommendation/Provision**
1. Idate Commission                     :   Recommended setting up a permanent commission for DNTs.
2. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871            :   Designated certain communities as 'born criminals'.
3. National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT):   Prepares a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
4. SEED Scheme                           :   Provides free competitive exam coaching to DNTs students only.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Idate Commission recommended a permanent commission for DNTs. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, wrongly labeled certain communities as 'born criminals'. The NCDNT prepares a state-wise list of DNT castes.  The SEED scheme provides free competitive exam coaching and other benefits to DNTs students.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 4 is incorrect; the SEED scheme also provides health insurance, among other benefits.  The focus on DNTs highlights the government's efforts to address historical injustices and promote their social and economic inclusion. The recommendations of various commissions and government initiatives reflect a growing understanding of the unique challenges faced by these communities.


**9. With reference to Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    **Act/Provision**                     **Key Feature**
1. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
2. Office of Chief Commissioner of PwDs       :   Set up under the PwD Act, 1995.
3. RPwD Act, 2016                          :   Mandates 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs in police forces.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, recognizes 21 types of disabilities and provides for reservation in government jobs and higher education institutions. The Office of Chief Commissioner of PwDs was established under the PwD Act, 1995.  The RPwD Act does not mandate reservation in police forces. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Pair 3 is incorrect; reservation is not applicable to police forces.  The RPwD Act's comprehensive approach to disability rights reflects a shift towards a more inclusive and rights-based framework. The establishment of the Office of Chief Commissioner strengthens the mechanism for enforcing these rights.

   Organization                                 Headquarter Location
1. UNFPA                                      :   Geneva, Switzerland
2. UNDESA                                     :   New York, USA
3. UN Commission on Population and Development :   Vienna, Austria
4. UN Committee on Rights of the Child          :   Geneva, Switzerland
5. World Food Programme                       :   Rome, Italy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only the pairs for UNDESA and the World Food Programme are correctly matched. UNDESA's headquarters are located in New York, USA, and the World Food Programme's headquarters are in Rome, Italy.  The headquarters of UNFPA is in New York, USA, not Geneva, Switzerland. The UN Commission on Population and Development and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child are both headquartered in New York, USA, not Vienna, Austria or Geneva, Switzerland respectively.  These incorrect pairings highlight the importance of precise factual recall in answering such questions.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair, making them incorrect.  Understanding the locations of key international organizations is crucial for UPSC aspirants, as these organizations frequently feature in current affairs and their actions can have significant global implications.


**2. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   NEP 2020 Feature                                     Specific Detail
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target by 2035       :   100% in Higher Education
2.  Multiple Exit Options in Undergraduate Degrees    :   Certification after first year, Diploma after second year
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)                :   Modelled on the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)
4. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                     :   Digitally stores academic credits earned from various institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only the pairs related to Multiple Exit Options and Academic Bank of Credit are correctly matched.  NEP 2020 indeed proposes multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees, allowing students to earn a certificate after the first year, a diploma after the second, and a bachelor's degree after the third.  The Academic Bank of Credit is designed to digitally store credits earned from various institutions.  However, the GER target for 2035 is 50% in higher education, not 100%. The National Research Foundation is modeled on the US National Science Foundation (NSF), not the UKRI. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (c) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes incorrectly matched pairs for GER target and the NRF model.   A thorough understanding of NEP 2020 and its various components is essential for UPSC aspirants, as it represents a significant policy shift in India's education sector.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Provision
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021              :  Allows commercial surrogacy
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971:  Allows termination up to 24 weeks for all women
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Imposes a fine of up to ₹5 lakh for employing manual scavengers
4.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:  Mandates 5% reservation in government jobs for all types of disabilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair concerning the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 is correctly matched. This Act indeed imposes a penalty of up to ₹1 lakh (not ₹5 lakh), and imprisonment for employing manual scavengers. The other pairs are incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 allows only altruistic surrogacy, not commercial surrogacy. The MTP Act, 1971, as amended in 2021, allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women and up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities. The incorrect pairings in options (a), (b), and (d) highlight the need for precise understanding of the legal frameworks governing these crucial social issues. This detailed knowledge is vital for UPSC preparation.


**4. With reference to organizations related to child welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Mandate/Function
1.  CARA                                        :   Oversees inter-country adoptions only
2.  NCPCR                                       :   Issues guidelines for the assessment of child suspects in heinous offences
3.  Bachpan Bachao Andolan                      :   Government agency focused on child labour rehabilitation
4.  District Child Welfare Committee             :   Declares children legally free for adoption

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairs for NCPCR and District Child Welfare Committee are correctly matched. The NCPCR does issue guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offences, and District Child Welfare Committees play a crucial role in declaring children legally free for adoption. CARA oversees both inter-country and intra-country adoptions. Bachpan Bachao Andolan is a non-governmental organization (NGO), not a government agency.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, demonstrating the importance of accurate knowledge about the roles and responsibilities of different organizations involved in child welfare.  Understanding the roles of these organizations is crucial for UPSC aspirants, as questions on child welfare and related legislation are frequently asked.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                   Releasing Organization
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                      :   World Bank
2. Global Gender Gap Index                        :   World Economic Forum
3. Gender Social Norms Index                      :   United Nations Development Programme
4. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index:   International Monetary Fund
5. Path to Equal Report                           :   UN Women and UNDP jointly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairs for the Global Gender Gap Index, Gender Social Norms Index, and Path to Equal Report are correctly matched. The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index, the UNDP releases the Gender Social Norms Index, and UN Women and UNDP jointly release the Path to Equal Report.  The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index is released by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, not the IMF. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (c) is also incorrect, as it only includes one incorrectly matched pair. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes incorrectly matched pairs for the GHI and the UHC SCI.  Familiarity with various global indices and reports is crucial for UPSC preparation, as these are often used to assess global development trends and challenges.


**1. With reference to Universal Health Coverage (UHC), consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Key Feature
    1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                    :   Focuses solely on tertiary level healthcare
    2. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)   :   Aims to restrict access to public healthcare facilities
    3. National Health Policy 2017               :   Aims to achieve UHC at an unaffordable cost
    4. Intensified Mission Indradhanush          :   Targets children aged 6-18 years for vaccination

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because Intensified Mission Indradhanush specifically targets zero-dose children aged between 0 and 5 years and pregnant women who might have missed any vaccine doses in the national immunization schedule.  The other options are incorrect. Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to address health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, not solely tertiary. ABDM aims to improve equitable access to quality healthcare, including through technology and national portability, not restricting it to public facilities. The National Health Policy 2017 aims to achieve UHC at an affordable cost, not unaffordable.


**2. Consider the following pairs related to the Anganwadi System:**

    Scheme/Program                     Feature
    1. Saksham Anganwadis                :   Exclusively targets children aged 0-3 years
    2. Poshan Tracker                     :   A web-based application for AWWs
    3. ICDS-CAS                           :   Replaces smartphones with registers
    4. Anganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana:   Covers AWWs and AWHs under PMJJBY and PMSBY only

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Poshan Tracker is a mobile-based application used by Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) for efficient service delivery and monitoring.  The other statements are inaccurate. Saksham Anganwadis target children aged 0-6 years, along with adolescent girls and focus on early childhood care and education. ICDS-CAS is a mobile-based application that replaces registers with smartphones.  Anganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana (AKBY) is a separate insurance scheme, in addition to the coverage under PMJJBY and PMSBY.


**3. With reference to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Index                                      Key Finding
    1. WHO report on WASH                       :   Unsafe WASH services caused 2.9% of global DALYs in 2022.
    2. UNICEF's Triple Threat Report             :   India is in the top 20 countries with the highest WASH-related child mortality.
    3. SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)      :   Aims for universal access to safe sanitation by 2050
    4. UNICEF report on India's WASH situation  :  India has reduced open defecation by about 450 million people.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer.  UNICEF's Triple Threat Report examines the triple burden of WASH threats faced by children, and India's progress in reducing open defecation is accurately reflected in the UNICEF report. The WHO report correctly stated that in 2019, use of safe WASH services could have prevented 2.5% of all deaths and 2.9% of all Disability-Adjusted Life years (DALYs) globally.  SDG 6 aims for universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030, not 2050.


**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

    Year                                    Key Finding
    1. GHI 2015                             :  India's GHI score was 27.0
    2. GHI 2023                             :  India ranked 111th among 125 countries
    3. GHI 2023                             :  South Asia had a GHI score of 28.7
    4. GHI 2023                             :  India's child stunting rate was 18.7%

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  In the 2023 GHI, India was ranked 111th among 125 countries. The other statements are inaccurate.  In 2015, India's GHI score was 29.2, not 27.0.  In 2023, South Asia had a GHI score of 27.0, not 28.7. India's child stunting rate in 2023 was 35.5%, not 18.7% (this was the child wasting rate).


**5.  Consider the following pairs related to the Open Defecation Free (ODF) status:**

    Status                                      Characteristic
    1. ODF                                      :   Every household uses safe sanitation technology.
    2. ODF Plus village                          :   Sustained ODF status and implemented solid waste management only.
    3. ODF Plus Model village                   :   Sustained ODF status with arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management.
    4. ODF Plus Model village                   : Displays ODF Plus IEC messages but lacks visual cleanliness

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct.  An ODF status means no visible faeces in the environment and every household uses safe sanitation technology. An ODF Plus Model village has sustained ODF status, implemented both solid and liquid waste management systems, and observes visual cleanliness.  The other options include incorrect descriptions of ODF Plus and ODF Plus Model village criteria.


**6. With reference to the UNFPA report, "State of World Population 2023," consider the following pairs:**

    Demographic Indicator                     Value/Characteristic
    1. India's Population in mid-2023         :   Below 1.4 billion
    2. India's population age group 15-64 years:  Below 60%
    3. Global life expectancy in 2019           :   77.2 years
    4. India's total fertility rate in 2023       :   2.2

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The UNFPA report indicates that around 68% of India's population falls within the 15-64 year age group.  The other options are incorrect. India's population in mid-2023 exceeded 1.4 billion. Global life expectancy in 2019 was 72.8 years. India's total fertility rate in 2023 was 2.0, not 2.2.


**7. Consider the following pairs related to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

    Aspect of NCF-SE                                   Feature
    1.  Foundational Stage                           : Covers ages 8-11
    2.  Board Examinations for Grades 10 and 12    :  Students allowed only one attempt per year.
    3.  Multilingualism                              :  Proficiency in at least two Indian languages required.
    4. Vocational Education                         : Focuses solely on work with materials and machines.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  NCF-SE emphasizes multilingualism, aiming for proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two Indian languages. The other statements are inaccurate. The Foundational Stage covers ages 3-8. Students are allowed to take board exams on at least two occasions. Vocational education encompasses work with life forms, materials and machines, and human services.


**8. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

    Year/Category                                 Key Finding
    1. PGI 2.0 (States/UTs), 2021-22           : All States/UTs achieved the highest grade (Daksh).
    2. PGI-D (Districts), 2020-21 & 2021-22     : No districts achieved the top two grades (Daksh and Utkarsh).
    3. PGI 2.0 (States/UTs), 2017-18           :  The deviation between maximum and minimum scores was 23.8%.
    4. PGI 2.0 (States/UTs), 2021-22           : Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the lowest grade (Akanshi-3).

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The PGI-D report for 2020-21 and 2021-22 indicated that no districts attained the top two grades. The other statements are incorrect. In PGI 2.0 (2021-22), no State/UT achieved the highest grade. The deviation between maximum and minimum scores in PGI 2.0 (2017-18) was 51%, not 23.8%.  Punjab and Chandigarh achieved a Prachesta-2 grade, not the lowest grade, in PGI 2.0 (2021-22).


**9.  Consider the following pairs related to Higher Education in India:**

    Act/Policy                                  Provision/Feature
    1. NEP 2020                                 :  Aims to decrease GER in higher education to 25% by 2035
    2. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023:  Prohibits institutions less than 20 years old from applying for DtbU status.
    3. UGC [Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India] Regulations, 2023 : Allows FHEIs to offer online programs.
    4. National Credit Framework (NCrF)          :  Does not integrate credits from vocational education.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. NEP 2020 aims to *increase* GER to at least 50% by 2035.  The 2023 DtbU regulations allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply. The 2023 FHEI regulations prohibit online programs.  NCrF explicitly integrates credits from vocational education.


**10. With reference to organizations involved in social issues, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Mandate/Activity
    1.  UNHCR                                      :  Focuses primarily on issues related to climate change.
    2.  IFPRI                                       : Primarily deals with water resource management.
    3.  GANHRI                                     : Directly participates in the UN General Assembly.
    4.  UNPFII                                     :  Deals with indigenous issues related to economic and social development.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) addresses indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights.  The other statements are incorrect. UNHCR focuses on refugees and asylum seekers. IFPRI focuses on food security and agricultural research. GANHRI accredits National Human Rights Institutions, not directly participating in UN General Assembly.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                                     Key Feature/Objective
1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                         :   Provides Rs. 5 lakh annual coverage per family
2. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY) :   Launched on September 12, 2019
3. Intensified Mission Indradhanush                 :   Focuses on reaching zero-dose children aged between 0 and 5 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana, indeed, provides a health insurance cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family annually for secondary and tertiary care hospitalizations.  This is a core feature of the scheme.  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY) was accurately launched on September 12, 2019, as a voluntary and contributory pension scheme for small and marginal farmers.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush's primary goal is to achieve zero-dose children (aged 0-5 years) and pregnant women who may have missed any vaccine doses in the national immunization schedule.  All three pairs accurately reflect key aspects of the respective schemes/programs. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                                 Implementing Ministry
1. Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
2. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0           :   Ministry of Rural Development
3. National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) is implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 falls under the purview of the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan is a multi-ministerial initiative, but its primary implementation and coordination are overseen by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**3. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                            Associated Feature
1. Poshan Tracker                               :   Used for dynamic identification of stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence
2. Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) :   Insurance coverage for AWWs and AWHs
3. Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK)      :   Referral support for Divyang children under the national Anganwadi protocol

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Poshan Tracker is a mobile-based application used by Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) to efficiently monitor and track nutrition service delivery, including identifying cases of stunting, wasting, and underweight children.  AWWs and AWHs are covered under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) as part of their insurance benefits.  The national Anganwadi protocol for Divyang children includes referral support through ASHA/ANM & Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) teams.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Key Activity/Report
1. UNFPA                                         :   Released the India Ageing Report 2023
2. UNDESA                                        :   Released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3. World Health Organization (WHO)                :   Released the Triple Threat Report on WASH-related threats

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) collaborated with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) to release the India Ageing Report 2023.  UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023.  The Triple Threat Report examining WASH-related threats faced by children was released by UNICEF, not WHO. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is correct, while options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 3.


**5. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan), consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                       Measurement/Objective
1. Stunting                                      :   Reduction in identified districts with the highest malnutrition burden
2. Child Mortality                               :   Measured as deaths per 1000 live births
3. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                       :   Used to monitor and guide nutrition-related interventions across ministries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Nutrition Mission aims to reduce stunting in districts with high malnutrition burdens. Child mortality is indeed measured as deaths per 1000 live births, a key indicator of child health and nutrition.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is not directly used to monitor and guide interventions *within* the National Nutrition Mission; it's a separate, broader index.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (b) is the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit a correctly matched pair or include an incorrectly matched one.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Key Provision/Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021            :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971:   Allows termination up to 26 weeks in all cases
3. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:   Bans manual scavenging

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, legally permits only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy.  The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks, with certain exceptions extending to 24 weeks under specific conditions; it does not allow termination up to 26 weeks in all cases.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, effectively bans the practice of manual scavenging.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 2 or omit correctly matched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disability-related Act/Program              Key Feature
1. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Recognizes 10 types of disabilities
2. National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children:  Emphasizes inclusion in community events
3.  Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995        :  Established the Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 10. The National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children does emphasize inclusion in community events as a key part of its approach. The Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995, did indeed establish the Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or omit correctly matched pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution                      Associated Function/Report
1. National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) :   Issued guidelines for assessment of child suspects in heinous offences
2. National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT):  Established the National Syllabus and Teaching Learning Material Committee (NSTC)
3.  National Medical Commission (NMC)            :   Granted WFME recognition for 10 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCPCR (National Commission for Protection of Child Rights) did issue guidelines for the assessment of child suspects in heinous offences under the Juvenile Justice Act.  NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) established the NSTC (National Syllabus and Teaching Learning Material Committee) to align school curricula with the NCF (National Curriculum Framework). The NMC (National Medical Commission) did receive WFME (World Federation for Medical Education) recognition for a 10-year period.  All three pairs are correctly matched. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.



**1. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                      Key Feature/Focus
1. Saksham Anganwadis                   :  Focuses exclusively on children aged 0-6 years
2. Poshan Tracker App                    :  Used solely for monitoring the attendance of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)
3. Anganwadi Services Scheme           :  Operates independently of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme
4.  National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children : Aims to screen for early disability signs only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Saksham Anganwadis:** This initiative aims to strengthen and upgrade Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) across India. While it significantly improves services for children aged 0-6 years, its scope extends beyond this age group to include adolescent girls (14-18 years) in specific districts and early childhood care and education (3-6 years) and early stimulation (0-3 years). Therefore, the statement is incorrect.

2. **Poshan Tracker App:** This mobile application is a job-aid for AWWs to efficiently deliver services and track their efforts.  Its functionality goes beyond simply monitoring attendance; it tracks nutritional service delivery and identifies prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight children.  The statement is inaccurate.

3. **Anganwadi Services Scheme:** This scheme is an integral part of the ICDS scheme. It does not operate independently; rather, it contributes significantly to the ICDS's objectives of improving the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers. The statement is false.

4. **National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children:** This protocol adopts a three-step approach: screening for early disability signs, inclusion in community events, and referral support.  It’s not limited to only screening. The statement is incorrect.


**2. With reference to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Primary Goal
1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                     :  Focuses solely on tertiary level healthcare
2. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)    :  Limits access to public healthcare facilities only
3. National Health Policy 2017                 :  Aims to achieve UHC at an exorbitant cost
4. Intensified Mission Indradhanush            :  Targets only pregnant women for vaccination

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Again, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's break down why:

1. **Ayushman Bharat Yojana:** This initiative aims to address health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.  It's not limited to just tertiary care. The statement is inaccurate.

2. **Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM):**  The ABDM aims to improve equitable access to quality healthcare by integrating both public and private healthcare providers. The statement is incorrect.

3. **National Health Policy 2017:** This policy aims to achieve UHC while delivering quality healthcare services at an *affordable* cost.  The statement misrepresents the policy's goal.

4. **Intensified Mission Indradhanush:** This mission targets zero-dose children aged 0-5 years *and* pregnant women who might have missed vaccine doses. The statement is incorrect.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                   Key Finding/Ranking
1.  2015                                  : India ranked below 100
2.  2023                                  : South Asia had the lowest hunger levels globally
3.  2023                                  : India's GHI score showed significant worsening compared to 2015
4.  2023                                  :  India's GHI score was categorized as "Serious"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.

1. **2015:** While the exact rank isn't specified in the provided text, the text does state that India's GHI score improved slightly from 2015 to 2023.  This implies that in 2015, India's rank was higher than its 2023 rank of 111th, and thus below 100. This statement is correct.

2. **2023:** The report indicates that South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa had the *highest*, not lowest, hunger levels. This statement is incorrect.

3. **2023:** India's GHI score in 2023 showed a slight *improvement* compared to 2015.  The statement is incorrect.

4. **2023:**  The 2023 report categorized India's hunger level as "Serious." This statement is correct.


**4. With reference to the Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Status                                     Characteristic
1. ODF                                       :  Every household uses safe sanitation technology
2. ODF Plus                                  : Requires only solid waste management systems
3. ODF Plus Model Village                     : Necessarily involves visual cleanliness and IEC messages
4.  ODF Plus Model Village                    :  Sustains ODF status but lacks liquid waste management

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.

1. **ODF:** The definition clearly states that ODF involves no visible faeces in the environment and every household uses safe sanitation technology. This statement is correct.

2. **ODF Plus:** ODF Plus requires implementation of *either* solid or liquid waste management systems, not just solid waste. The statement is incorrect.

3. **ODF Plus Model Village:**  The definition explicitly includes visual cleanliness (minimal litter, stagnant wastewater, plastic waste) and ODF Plus IEC messages. This statement is correct.

4. **ODF Plus Model Village:** An ODF Plus Model Village *must* have arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management. The statement is incorrect.


**5. With reference to organizations involved in population and development, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Key Report/Activity
1. UNFPA                                      : Released the "Triple Threat Report" on WASH
2. UNDESA                                     :  Published the "India Ageing Report 2023"
3. UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD): Monitors implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action
4. World Food Programme (WFP)                :  Focuses primarily on sexual and reproductive health

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.

1. **UNFPA:** The UNFPA's key report is the State of World Population report. The "Triple Threat Report" is associated with UNICEF. This statement is incorrect.

2. **UNDESA:** The "India Ageing Report 2023" was released by UNFPA in collaboration with IIPS. This statement is incorrect.

3. **UNCPD:** This commission is explicitly tasked with monitoring and reviewing the implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action. This statement is correct.

4. **World Food Programme (WFP):** The WFP's primary focus is on food security and hunger relief, not sexual and reproductive health. This is the domain of UNFPA. This statement is incorrect.


**6. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan), consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry/Agency                         Role/Responsibility
1. Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD):  Solely responsible for implementing POSHAN Abhiyan
2. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)               :  Not involved in data collection for POSHAN Abhiyan
3.  ICDS-Common Application Software (CAS) :  Does not utilize smartphones for data collection
4.  POSHAN Abhiyan                          : Aims to increase stunting in identified districts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

1. **MoWCD:** While MoWCD plays a crucial role, POSHAN Abhiyan involves the coordination and supervision of multiple ministries to ensure holistic development and adequate nutrition.  The statement is incorrect.

2. **AWWs:** AWWs are actively involved in data collection using the ICDS-CAS and Poshan Tracker app.  The statement is incorrect.

3. **ICDS-CAS:** This software facilitates data capture by frontline functionaries using smartphones.  The statement is incorrect.

4. **POSHAN Abhiyan:** The mission aims to *reduce*, not increase, stunting in identified districts with high malnutrition burdens. The statement is incorrect.


**7. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   NEP 2020 Feature                       Implementation Detail
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target   : Aims for 50% GER in higher education by 2025
2.  Multiple exit options                  :  Does not allow for diploma exit after two years of undergraduate study
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)     :  Does not subsume the SERB
4. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)          :  Does not digitally store academic credits

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

1. **GER target:** The NEP aims for at least 50% GER by 2035, not 2025. The statement is incorrect.

2. **Multiple exit options:** The NEP explicitly allows for multiple exit options, including a diploma after two years of undergraduate study. The statement is incorrect.

3. **NRF:** The Anusandhan NRF Act, 2023, explicitly repealed the SERB and subsumed it into the NRF. The statement is incorrect.

4. **ABC:** The ABC is designed to digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions. The statement is incorrect.


**8. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   NCF-SE Feature                         Implementation Detail
1.  Schooling Structure                  : Retains the existing four-stage schooling structure
2. Board Examinations                    :  Allows students to take board exams only once a year
3.  Multilingualism                      :  Students are required to be proficient in only one Indian language
4. Vocational Education                  : Does not propose engagement in work with human services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

1. **Schooling Structure:** The NCF-SE introduces a new 5+3+3+4 structure, replacing the existing four-stage system. The statement is incorrect.

2. **Board Examinations:** The NCF-SE allows students to take board exams on at least two occasions during a school year.  The statement is incorrect.

3. **Multilingualism:** The NCF-SE emphasizes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages. The statement is incorrect.

4. **Vocational Education:** The NCF-SE includes work with human services as one of the three proposed forms of vocational engagement. The statement is incorrect.



**1. With reference to Child Labour in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                                      Key Feature
    1. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016 :  Prohibits employment of children below 18 years in all occupations
    2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme     :   Focuses solely on rehabilitation of child labourers through vocational training
    3. PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal : Managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development
    4. Bachpan Bachao Andolan                       : A government initiative to rescue child labourers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  Option 1 incorrectly states that it prohibits employment of children below 18 years in *all* occupations. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme indeed focuses on the rehabilitation of child labourers through education and skill development, but it also involves other aspects like identification and rescue. Option 2 is partially correct but oversimplifies the scheme.  PENCiL portal is managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development, making option 3 incorrect. Bachpan Bachao Andolan is a prominent NGO, not a government initiative, making option 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 (partially) and 4 are correctly matched, although with important qualifications.


**2. With reference to the Anganwadi System in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Program/Initiative                                   Description
    1. Saksham Anganwadis                              : Aims to reduce stunting by improving utilization of Anganwadi services
    2. Poshan Tracker App                               : A job-aid for Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) for efficient service delivery
    3. ICDS-Common Application Software (CAS)          : Used for dynamic identification of malnutrition but not for service delivery tracking
    4. National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan : Primarily focuses on adolescent girls in Aspirational Districts only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Saksham Anganwadis is indeed a targeted intervention to improve AWCs, indirectly contributing to reducing malnutrition and stunting by enhancing service delivery.  Poshan Tracker is a mobile application that helps AWWs in efficient service delivery and monitoring.  Option 3 is incorrect because ICDS-CAS is used for data capture and tracking, including service delivery aspects.  The National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) has a broader focus than just adolescent girls in Aspirational Districts; it aims for holistic nutrition improvement across various groups. Thus, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of NCF-SE                                   Feature
    1.  Curriculum Framework                         : Based on a 4+3+3+4 age-based design of schooling
    2. Board Examinations                            : Students allowed to take board exams only once a year
    3. Multilingualism                               :  Students must be proficient in at least three languages, including at least one foreign language.
    4. Vocational Education                          :  Involves engagement in only two different forms of work

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE is based on a 5+3+3+4 age-based design, not 4+3+3+4, making option 1 incorrect.  Students are allowed to take board exams on at least two occasions, not just once, making option 2 incorrect. While the NCF-SE promotes multilingualism, it emphasizes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages; it doesn't mandate a foreign language, making option 3 incorrect. NCF-SE proposes engagement in three different forms of work, not two, making option 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                         Definition
    1. Manual Scavenger                             :  Exclusively refers to individuals cleaning human waste from insanitary latrines
    2. Insanitary Latrine                            : A latrine that is not connected to a sewage system
    3. Safal Karamcharis                            :  Are explicitly excluded from the definition of manual scavengers under PEMSR
    4.  Rehabilitation Measures under PEMSR        : Primarily focuses on providing financial assistance only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The definition of manual scavenger under PEMSR is broader than just cleaning insanitary latrines; it includes cleaning human waste from various sources. Option 1 is therefore incorrect. An insanitary latrine is indeed one not connected to a sewage system.  Safal Karamcharis, while often involved in sanitation work, are not explicitly excluded from the definition of manual scavengers if they are performing manual scavenging tasks without proper safety equipment. Option 3 is therefore incorrect. Rehabilitation under PEMSR involves various measures, including skill development and alternative employment, not just financial assistance. Option 4 is therefore incorrect. Only the definition of an insanitary latrine (option 2) is accurately matched.


**5. With reference to the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) Report, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                    Finding (Illustrative -  actual values may vary slightly)
    1. Total Fertility Rate (TFR)                   :  Significantly increased compared to NFHS-4
    2.  Prevalence of Stunting among Children       :  Remained largely unchanged compared to NFHS-4
    3.  Prevalence of Anemia among Women            : Showed a substantial decrease compared to NFHS-4
    4.  Institutional Deliveries                      : Remained below 50% across all states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

NFHS-5 data shows a decrease in TFR compared to NFHS-4, making statement 1 incorrect. While the exact numbers vary by state and region, stunting among children also generally showed a decline in NFHS-5, making statement 2 incorrect.  Anemia among women did show a decrease, although the extent varies across states, making statement 3 partially correct. Institutional deliveries have increased significantly, but the statement that they remain below 50% across all states is incorrect, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 3 is partially correct, though with the caveat of variation across states.  The question highlights the need for precise understanding of NFHS-5 data.


**6. With reference to the  Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Objective
    1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                       :  Focuses exclusively on tertiary healthcare services
    2. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)       :  Aims to enhance the portability of health services
    3. National Health Policy 2017                   :  Does not address the affordability of healthcare services
    4. Intensified Mission Indradhanush             :  Targets only children aged between 0 and 2 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to improve healthcare access across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, making option 1 incorrect. ABDM indeed aims to improve access and portability of health services.  The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly addresses affordability as a key dimension of UHC, making option 3 incorrect. Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets children aged 0-5 years and pregnant women, making option 4 incorrect.  Only option 2 accurately reflects the objective of ABDM.


**7. With reference to the  Organizations in News related to Social Issues, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                   Key Function/Report

(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

UNFPA's mandate is focused on sexual and reproductive health, not combating hunger, making option 1 incorrect. UNDESA does release the World Youth Report. UNCPD monitors the implementation of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action. WFP supports India's food security initiatives, including collaboration with the Poverty and Human Development Monitoring Agency. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to  Miscellaneous topics related to Social Issues, consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                   Key Feature

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index focuses on economic participation, education, health, and political empowerment.  The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the UNDP, not the World Bank. The UHC SCI tracks progress on SDG 3.8.1, including service capacity and access. The Path to Equal Report does introduce WEI and GGPI. Therefore, pairs 1, 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of different indices and their releasing bodies.

(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA, not Rome, Italy.  The UNHCR's headquarters is in Geneva, Switzerland, not Washington, D.C. The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is indeed headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.  Finally, the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is correctly matched with its headquarters in New York, USA. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCERT was established in 1961, not 1971.  The Paris Principles were adopted in 1993, correctly reflecting the establishment of standards for National Human Rights Institutions. The NMC was established in 2019, not 2016. The National Education Policy (NEP) was launched in 2020, making this pair correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Indian education system, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Key Provision/Feature
1.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021     :  Regulates the practice of surrogacy in India.
2.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a child as a person below 18 years of age.
3.  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020     :  Introduces a 10+2 structure for school education.

(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, accurately regulates surrogacy. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, correctly defines a child as under 18. The NEP 2020  introduced a 5+3+3+4 structure, not a 10+2 structure. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to eliminate manual scavenging. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                                 Primary Focus Area
1.  International Solar Alliance (ISA)                 :  Promotion of renewable energy sources.
2.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)                 :  Combating money laundering and terrorist financing.
3.  Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) :  Disaster management for small-scale industries.
4.  Mineral Security Partnership (MSP)                :  Global cooperation on mineral resources.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The ISA focuses on solar energy, the FATF on financial crime, and the MSP on mineral security; all correctly matched. However, the CDRI's focus is broader than just small-scale industries; it addresses disaster resilience in infrastructure across various sectors. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Mandate/Function
1.  World Food Programme (WFP)                     :  Provides food assistance in emergencies.
2.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)           :  Focuses on reproductive health and rights.
3.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) :  Deals with issues related to indigenous peoples.
4.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)       :  Finances infrastructure projects in Asia.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only

   Scheme/Initiative                                  Implementing Ministry
1.  National Family Health Survey (NFHS)             : Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)                : Ministry of Jal Shakti
3.  Poshan Abhiyan                                  : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
4.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP)             : Ministry of Labour and Employment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NFHS is conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) falls under the Ministry of Jal Shakti.  Poshan Abhiyan is indeed under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The NCLP is correctly linked to the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Thus, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                    Primary Concern

3.  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993      :  Establishment of the National Human Rights Commission.
4.  The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 :  Legal framework for adoption within the Hindu community.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only

All pairs are correctly matched. The RPwD Act addresses disability rights, including reservations. The Surrogacy Act regulates surrogacy. The Protection of Human Rights Act established the NHRC. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act governs Hindu adoptions. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Commission                                    Recommendation/Report
1.  Idate Commission                                     :  Establishment of a permanent commission for Denotified Tribes.
2.  K. Radhakrishnan Committee                          :  Reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions.
3.  Second Backward Classes Commission (Mandal Commission) :  Estimated OBC population at 52%.
4.  U.N. Dhebar Commission                               :  First recognized Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. The Idate Commission recommended a permanent body for DNTs. The K. Radhakrishnan Committee proposed higher education accreditation reforms. The Mandal Commission estimated the OBC population. The Dhebar Commission was instrumental in the initial recognition of PTGs.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Category of Children                         Legal Framework/Act
1.  Orphaned, Abandoned, or Surrendered Children  :  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956
2.  Children in Childcare Institutions             :  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
3.  Child Labourers                               :  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
4.  Children in Conflict with Law                   :  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act deals with adoptions, it doesn't specifically address orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered children comprehensively; the Juvenile Justice Act does.  The Juvenile Justice Act correctly covers children in childcare institutions.  The Child Labour Act addresses child labour, and the Surrogacy Act is unrelated to children in conflict with the law; that falls under Juvenile Justice Act. Therefore only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Index                                     Releasing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index              :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index           :   World Economic Forum

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is indeed jointly released by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.  The Global Gender Gap Index is published annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Economic Forum. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly attribute the releasing organizations to the indices.  Understanding the key players in global development reporting is crucial for UPSC preparation, as these organizations often feature prominently in current affairs and policy discussions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Path to Equal Report does indeed introduce the Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI).  The UNHCR's "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" focuses on forced displacement, including the impact of social and climate crises. The WHO and World Bank's "Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring report" highlights accessibility, affordability, and quality as key dimensions of UHC.  Understanding the key themes and focus areas of these reports is important for UPSC aspirants, as they reflect global development priorities and challenges.

1. National Indicator Framework (NIF)     :   Aligns with SDGs global indicators and includes India-specific indicators
2. Global Indicator Framework (GIF)      :   Framed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs)
3. State Indicator Framework (SIF)       :   Developed and circulated by States/UTs following MoSPI guidelines

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The NIF does indeed incorporate both global SDG indicators and those tailored to India's context. The GIF is accurately described as being framed by the IAEG-SDGs.  The SIFs are correctly identified as developed by States/UTs based on guidelines provided by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI).  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the structure and function of the indicator frameworks used for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in India, a crucial topic for the UPSC exam.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Washington, DC (US)
2. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) :   Geneva (Switzerland)
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) :   New York (US)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the first two pairs are correctly matched.  IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, DC, and UNHCR's are in Geneva. However, GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York.  Knowledge of the locations of these international organizations is useful for UPSC preparation as it demonstrates awareness of global governance structures.


**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCF), consider the following pairs:**

Framework                                   Feature
1. National Credit Framework (NCrF)       :   Integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education
2. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) :   Part of the NCrF framework
3. National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) :   Not included in the NCrF framework


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF does indeed integrate credits earned across different educational streams. The NHEQF is explicitly mentioned as a component of the NCrF.  However, the NSQF is also a part of the NCrF, making statement 3 incorrect.  This question assesses understanding of the NCrF, a crucial element of the NEP 2020 and a frequently discussed topic in education-related current affairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The PEMSR Act explicitly prohibits manual scavenging.  The RPwD Act recognizes a comprehensive list of 21 disabilities. The JJ Act defines a child as someone under 18.  This question tests knowledge of key legislation related to social justice and vulnerable groups—a recurring theme in the UPSC exam.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect the focus areas of the mentioned schemes. The NCLP scheme focuses on rehabilitating child laborers. The SRMS scheme aims to rehabilitate manual scavengers into alternative employment. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focuses on improving the nutritional and health status of young children. This question tests knowledge of government schemes targeting vulnerable populations, a key element of the UPSC syllabus.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and the UNPFII is based in New York, USA.  These are factual and verifiable details about the locations of these organizations. Option (a) is incorrect because IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Rome. Option (c) is incorrect because GANHRI is located in Geneva and WFP in Rome, Italy. Option (d) is incorrect because of the errors in the locations of IFPRI, GANHRI and WFP headquarters.  Understanding the locations of key international organizations is crucial for UPSC preparation, as it demonstrates awareness of global governance structures and their operational contexts.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between correct and incorrect information related to international organizations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

4. 2011                                      : Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) conducted
5. 2016                                      :  Caste data from SECC finalized and published

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair relating to 2011 is correctly matched. The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) was indeed conducted in 2011.  Option (a) is incorrect because caste-wise enumeration was introduced in 1881, not abandoned. Option (b) is incorrect because in 1931, caste-based data was collected but not published, unlike the statement in the pair.  Option (c) is incorrect because in 1941, caste-based data was collected but not published, and the caste data from SECC was not finalized and published in 2016. The question assesses factual recall concerning the history of caste census in India, highlighting the complexities and controversies surrounding data collection and its implications for policy-making.  A thorough understanding of this history is crucial for analyzing contemporary debates on social justice and equity in India.

4. WFP                                           : Global Food Policy Report 2023: Rethinking food crisis responses
5. UNHCR                                        : State of World Population Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair connecting the World Food Programme (WFP) with the Global Food Policy Report 2023 is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly link organizations with reports they did not publish. Option (a) is incorrect because UNFPA published the State of World Population Report, not the UNHCR report on forced displacement. Option (b) is incorrect because UNDESA published the SDG progress report, not the India Ageing Report. Option (c) is incorrect because IFPRI released the Global Food Policy Report, not the SDG Progress Report. The question tests the understanding of the roles and publications of various UN agencies and research institutions, highlighting the importance of understanding the source of information and its credibility in the context of policy analysis.


**4. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                                Target Year

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. NEP 2020 aims to achieve 100% GER in preschool to secondary level by 2035. The other options incorrectly state the target years for the other policy features. Option (a) is incorrect because the target year for achieving 50% GER in Higher Education is 2035, not 2025. Option (b) is incorrect because the implementation of the 5+3+3+4 curricular structure is a phased process and doesn't have a specific single target year mentioned in NEP 2020. Option (d) is incorrect because of the errors in target years for the first and second pairs. This question tests the understanding of the NEP 2020's key goals and timelines, crucial for analyzing its implementation and impact on the Indian education system.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The first three pairs are correctly matched. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act bans the practice, the National Policy for mechanized Sanitation aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning, and Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans. Option (a) is incorrect as it excludes the correct pairing of Swachhta Udyami Yojana. Option (c) is incorrect as it wrongly links NAMASTE scheme with rehabilitation. Option (d) is incorrect due to the error in the last pair.  This question assesses knowledge of government schemes and acts related to sanitation and the eradication of manual scavenging, a significant social issue in India.  Understanding these initiatives is vital for analyzing government efforts in improving sanitation and hygiene.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                                   State/UT

2. Kamar PVTG                                 : Chhattisgarh
3. Baiga PVTG                                : Madhya Pradesh
4. Hakki Pikki Tribe                           : Karnataka


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kamar and Baiga tribes are indeed found in Chhattisgarh, and the Hakki Pikki tribe resides in Karnataka. These are factual details about the geographical distribution of tribal groups in India. Option (a) is incorrect because Bharia PVTG is found in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha. Option (c) is incorrect because it excludes the correct pairing of Baiga PVTG. Option (d) is incorrect because of the error in the first pair.  The question tests knowledge of the geographical distribution of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India, highlighting the importance of understanding the diversity of tribal populations and their specific needs.


**7. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                       Implementing Ministry
1.  POSHAN Abhiyan                        : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0    : Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) : Ministry of Rural Development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 are indeed implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  The other options incorrectly attribute the programs to different ministries. Option (a) is incorrect because POSHAN Abhiyan is a multi-ministerial initiative, with MoWCD playing a major role. Option (c) is incorrect because ICDS is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Option (d) is incorrect due to the errors in the first and third pairs. This question assesses knowledge of the administrative structure of key government programs related to child welfare and nutrition, highlighting the importance of understanding the roles and responsibilities of various ministries.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Initiative                     Year of Significance
1. National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)  : 2005
2. National Education Policy (NEP)                         : 2020
3. National Credit Framework (NCrF)                         : 2021
4. Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education system: 2017

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) was last revised in 2005.  The National Education Policy (NEP) was implemented in 2020. The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for States/UTs was first released for 2017-18.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) was released later than 2021, making option (d) incorrect.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (b) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of PGI and 2017. The question tests factual recall of significant years in Indian education policy development, highlighting the evolution of the educational framework.  Understanding the chronology is crucial for analyzing the interconnectedness of these policies and their impact on the education system.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Ranking                  Organization
1. Times Higher Education World University Rankings: QS Quacquarelli Symonds
2. Global 2000 Report                           : Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR)
3. QS World University Ranking                : Times Higher Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global 2000 Report is released by the Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR). This is a correctly matched pair.  However, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings are distinct from the QS World University Rankings.  The Times Higher Education ranking is not associated with QS Quacquarelli Symonds, and the QS World University Ranking is not associated with Times Higher Education. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. The question tests the ability to differentiate between various higher education ranking organizations and their respective publications.  Knowledge of these organizations and their methodologies is vital for evaluating the credibility and scope of different university rankings.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Policy Feature              Description

2. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)       : A digital platform to store academic credits earned from various institutions
3. National Research Foundation (NRF) : Aims to catalyze and expand research and innovation across the country
4. National Educational Technology Forum (NETF):  Focuses on improving the quality of school education by strengthening teacher training

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) accurately measures student enrollment in higher education as a percentage of the eligible 18-23 age group. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a digital platform for storing academic credits. The National Research Foundation (NRF) aims to boost research and innovation nationally.  These three pairs are correctly matched. However, the National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) focuses on enhancing learning, assessment, and administration in both schools and higher education, not solely on improving school education through teacher training. Therefore, option (d) is incorrect. Options (b) and (c) are also incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs. The question assesses the understanding of key policy features introduced by NEP 2020 and their functions, demonstrating a grasp of higher education reforms in India.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry/Organization                 Scheme/Act
1. Ministry of Women and Child Development : Swachhta Udyami Yojana
2. Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment: NAMASTE scheme
3. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs    : Saksham Anganwadi
4. Ministry of Education                   : National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NAMASTE scheme is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) falls under the Ministry of Education.  These are correctly matched pairs. However, the Swachhta Udyami Yojana is not primarily associated with the Ministry of Women and Child Development, and Saksham Anganwadi is not directly under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect. This question tests the knowledge of various government schemes and their associated ministries, requiring an understanding of the administrative structure of social welfare programs in India.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                     Organization
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                     : Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
2. Global Gender Gap Index                       : United Nations Development Programme
3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI): World Health Organization and World Bank
4. Gender Social Norms Index                     : World Economic Forum


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is jointly released by the World Health Organization and the World Bank. These two pairs are correctly matched.  However, the Global Gender Gap Index is published by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP, and the Gender Social Norms Index is a UNDP publication. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect. This question assesses knowledge of various global indices and their releasing organizations, demanding an understanding of international development organizations and their roles in data collection and reporting.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                     Key Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021                 : Allows commercial surrogacy
2. Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021: Regulates ART clinics and banks
3. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013: Bans manual scavenging
4. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015: Defines a child as a person below 16 years of age


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, aims to regulate ART clinics and banks, preventing misuse and ensuring ethical practices. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly bans manual scavenging. These are correctly matched. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, permits only altruistic surrogacy, not commercial surrogacy, and the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, defines a child as a person below 18 years of age. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect. This question tests knowledge of specific legislation related to social issues, requiring detailed understanding of the legal frameworks governing these areas.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Report/Index
1. UNFPA                                         : Global Gender Gap Index
2. UNDESA                                        : Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report
3. UNHCR                                         : Global Trends: Forced Displacement Report
4. IFPRI                                          : Global Food Policy Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report. UNHCR (UN High Commissioner for Refugees) publishes the Global Trends: Forced Displacement Report. IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) releases the Global Food Policy Report. These three pairs are correctly matched.  However, UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) does not release the Global Gender Gap Index; that is published by the World Economic Forum. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. This question assesses knowledge of different international organizations and their key publications, requiring familiarity with the mandates and activities of these bodies.  It tests the ability to link organizations with their areas of expertise and output.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group Category                       Description
1. Scheduled Tribes (STs)                   :  Centrally recognized special categories from among STs
2. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):  Communities notified as 'born criminal' during British rule
3. De-notified Tribes (DNTs)                 :  Groups with pre-agricultural technology and low literacy levels


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description of De-notified Tribes (DNTs) as communities labeled "born criminal" during British rule is accurate.  However, the descriptions for Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) are incorrect.  PVTGs are indeed special categories within STs, characterized by pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and often declining populations.  STs are not defined by being special categories within themselves. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. This question tests understanding of the different categories of tribal groups in India and their historical and social contexts.  It highlights the complexities of tribal classification and the nuances within these designations.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Initiative                        Objective
1.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme:  Rehabilitation of child labourers
2.  Bachpan Bachao Andolan                      :  Promoting mechanized sanitation
3.  PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal: Rescuing and rehabilitating child labour victims
4.  NAMASTE scheme                             :  Providing concessional loans for sanitation equipment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCLP scheme focuses on the rehabilitation of child laborers, and the PENCiL portal aids in rescuing and rehabilitating them. These are correctly matched.  Bachpan Bachao Andolan is an NGO focused on child liberation, not sanitation, and the NAMASTE scheme promotes mechanized sanitation, not concessional loans. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The question assesses knowledge of government initiatives and NGO activities related to child labor and sanitation, requiring familiarity with both governmental and non-governmental efforts in these areas.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                     Function/Mandate
1.  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR):  Oversees medical education and practice
2.  National Medical Commission (NMC)             : Monitors implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
3.  UN Committee on Rights of the Child (UNCRC)   :  Protects the rights of children
4.  GANHRI                                         : Accredits National Human Rights Institutions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNCRC monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and GANHRI accredits National Human Rights Institutions. These are correctly matched.  NCPCR's mandate is to protect child rights, and NMC regulates medical education and practice; however, their descriptions in the pairs are assigned incorrectly. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the knowledge of various national and international organizations and their respective functions, requiring an understanding of their mandates and roles in protecting human rights.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                          Ministry
1. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0       :    Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  National Rural Health Mission                :    Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
3.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)          :    Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation
4.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 is indeed a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) falls under the purview of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan is also a flagship programme of the Ministry of Women and Child Development. However, the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) is implemented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti (Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation).  Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the correct matching of schemes with their respective ministries. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings, making them unsuitable.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Provision/Feature
1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005   : Defines domestic violence to include emotional abuse
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971     : Allows abortion up to 24 weeks for all women
3.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016           : Mandates 4% reservation in all government jobs
4. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, comprehensively defines domestic violence, including emotional, physical, sexual, and economic abuse.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines. However, the MTP Act, 1971, as amended, does not allow abortion up to 24 weeks for *all* women; there are specific conditions and time limits. Similarly, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates reservation in government jobs, but not necessarily 4% across the board—exceptions apply to certain forces.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are accurately matched.


**3. With reference to educational policies and frameworks in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Framework/Policy                                    Key Feature
1. National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) :  Divides education into 8 levels
2. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020                :  Advocates for a 5+3+3+4 schooling structure
3. National Credit Framework (NCrF)                    :  Focuses solely on higher education credit transfer
4.  National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) :   Integrates credits from school, higher education, and vocational training


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE does not divide education into 8 levels; it outlines a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure. NEP 2020 indeed proposes this 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling. The NCrF is a meta-framework that aims to integrate credits from school, higher, and vocational education, not solely higher education. The NHEQF is a component of the NCrF and contributes to the integration of credits across educational levels. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                      Key Mandate/Activity
1.  UNFPA                                             :  Released the India Ageing Report 2023

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA collaborated on the release of the India Ageing Report 2023. UNDESA released the SDG Progress Report 2023. The World Food Programme (WFP) was indeed awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) conducts research focused on reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, aligning with food security goals. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                                           PGI Grade in 2021-22
1. Punjab                                             :   Prachesta-2

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) All except 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the Prachesta-2 grade in the PGI 2021-22. Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram were indeed placed in the lowest grade, Akanshi-3.  However, the provided text does not specify Kerala's grade in 2021-22. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are confirmed as correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                      Report/Index Released

2.  United Nations Development Programme        :   Gender Social Norms Index
3.  World Health Organization and World Bank      :   UHC Service Coverage Index
4.  UN Women and UNDP                           :   Path to Equal Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) All except 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index. The United Nations Development Programme publishes the Gender Social Norms Index. The World Health Organization and the World Bank jointly release the UHC Service Coverage Index. UN Women and UNDP collaboratively produce the Path to Equal Report. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  


**7. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Framework/System                                   Key Feature
1.  National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) :  Covers levels 4.5-8 of the NCrF
2.  National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)       :  Integrates with NHEQF under the NCrF
3.  National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF) :  Covers levels 1-4 of the NCrF

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NHEQF aligns with levels 4.5-8 of the NCrF. The NSQF and NSEQF integrate with NHEQF under the NCrF umbrella. The ABC system is designed to store credits earned from various educational routes.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Group                                      Status/Characteristic
1.  Bharia                                           :  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG)
2.  Kamar                                            :  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG)
3.  Baiga                                            :  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG)
4.  Hakki Pikki                                      : Semi-nomadic tribal group

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) All except 1


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all recognized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). The Hakki Pikki tribe is indeed a semi-nomadic group.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                    Key Feature/Provision
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021                : Allows only altruistic surrogacy
2.  Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021  : Regulates ART clinics and banks
3.  POSH Act, 2013                                  :  Establishes Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs)
4.  The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                   : Was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) All except 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, permits only altruistic surrogacy. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, regulates ART clinics and banks. The POSH Act, 2013, mandates the establishment of ICCs. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on social issues and organizations, drawing upon the factual data in the target content.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and can vary depending on the examinee's prior knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                           Headquarters Location
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Geneva, Switzerland
2.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Washington, D.C., USA
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA
4. UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) : Rome, Italy
5. World Food Programme (WFP) :  Geneva, Switzerland

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA.  The UNHCR is indeed based in Geneva, Switzerland. GANHRI is also headquartered in Geneva, not New York. The UNPFII's headquarters is in New York, not Rome. Finally, the World Food Programme (WFP) is headquartered in Rome, Italy. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.  The incorrect options present plausible distractors by mixing correct and incorrect headquarters locations, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of these organizations.


**2. With reference to reports released by international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

Report Title                                     Releasing Organization
1. Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report :  World Food Programme (WFP)
2. Global Food Policy Report 2023: Rethinking food crisis responses : International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
3.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition : UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
4. State of World Population Report 2023: 8 Billion Lives Infinite Possibilities : UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" is indeed released by the UNHCR, not WFP. The Global Food Policy Report 2023 is correctly attributed to IFPRI. The SDG Progress Report 2023 is accurately linked to UNDESA. Finally, the State of World Population Report 2023 is correctly associated with UNFPA, not UNCPD.  Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific reports and the organizations responsible for their publication, demanding precise recall.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy                                   Key Provision/Focus
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021  :   Allows only commercial surrogacy
2.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 : Defines domestic violence to include only physical abuse
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) :  Focuses solely on urban sanitation
4.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (amended 2021) :  Allows abortion only up to 12 weeks of pregnancy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, permits only altruistic surrogacy, not commercial.  PWDVA 2005 encompasses various forms of abuse, not just physical. PEMSR addresses manual scavenging across both rural and urban areas. The MTP Act, as amended, allows for termination of pregnancy beyond 12 weeks under specific conditions. All the pairs are incorrectly matched, highlighting the need for precise understanding of legislation. This question tests the candidate's ability to evaluate the accuracy of statements about different acts and policies related to social issues.


**4. With reference to Indian Government initiatives related to social welfare, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                     Primary Goal/Focus
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                   :  Improving sanitation in rural areas
2.  Saksham Anganwadis                      :  Strengthening Anganwadi Centers and expanding services
3.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan :  Reducing stunting and improving nutrition for women and children
4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush           :  Providing access to higher education for marginalized communities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) Only three
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on health insurance and access to healthcare, not sanitation.  Saksham Anganwadis is correctly linked to upgrading and expanding Anganwadi services.  POSHAN Abhiyan's goal is accurately described. Intensified Mission Indradhanush aims to improve immunization coverage, not higher education. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of various government schemes and their objectives, requiring both factual recall and analytical skills to differentiate between similar-sounding initiatives.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Commission/Body                       Mandate/Function
1. National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) :  Monitoring implementation of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015
2. National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) :  Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs
3.  Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD :  Safeguarding rights of Persons with Disabilities and reviewing policies
4.  Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) :  Regulating surrogacy practices in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCPCR's mandate aligns with the Juvenile Justice Act. The NCDNT is correctly paired with its function. The Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD accurately reflects its role.  However, CARA's primary function is not surrogacy regulation; that falls under the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act and related bodies. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the roles and responsibilities of various government bodies involved in social welfare, requiring knowledge of their specific mandates.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/UT
1.  Bharia PVTG                             :   Chhattisgarh
2.  Kamar PVTG                              :   Madhya Pradesh
3.  Baiga PVTG                               :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4.  Highest number of PVTGs                 :   Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because Odisha houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India.  The other options are incorrect because the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Therefore, pairing them with only one state is inaccurate.  Andaman and Nicobar Islands does not have a significant concentration of Baiga tribes compared to Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The question plays on the fact that the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are found in multiple states, creating plausible but incorrect distractors.  Understanding the distribution of PVTGs across different states is crucial for comprehending India's tribal demographics and the challenges in implementing welfare schemes effectively.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                       Ministry
1.  National Clean Air Programme                  :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
4.  Anganwadi Services Scheme                     :   Ministry of Women and Child Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the Anganwadi Services Scheme falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The other options are incorrect due to mismatches in the ministries responsible for the various acts and schemes.  The National Clean Air Programme is under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The SEED scheme is under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 is primarily handled by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, although other ministries might have a role in its implementation. This question tests the knowledge of various government ministries and their responsibilities in social welfare and development programs, highlighting the need for precise understanding of administrative structures.


**3. With reference to Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Committee                           Recommendation
1.  U.N. Dhebar Commission                       :   Renamed PTGs as PVTGs in 2006.
2.  Renke Commission                             :   Estimated nearly 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.
3.  Idate Commission                             :   Recommended setting up a permanent commission for DNTs.
4.  Mandal Commission                             :   Estimated OBC population at 52%.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The Idate Commission recommended a permanent commission for De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs), and the Mandal Commission estimated the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) population. The other pairs are incorrect.  The U.N. Dhebar Commission's recommendation to rename PTGs as PVTGs was implemented in 2006, but the commission itself didn't do the renaming. The Renke Commission did not estimate the number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes; that figure is often associated with the Renke Commission's work but is not a direct output of its report.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various commissions and committees related to tribal welfare, testing their ability to link specific recommendations with the correct bodies.  It emphasizes the need for precise knowledge rather than general understanding.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Key Feature
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :   Allows commercial surrogacy.
2.  Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021  :   Regulates ART clinics and banks.
3.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :   Allows termination up to 24 weeks for all women.
4.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:  Provides for rehabilitation of manual scavengers.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, does regulate ART clinics and banks, and the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, does provide for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers. Option 1 is incorrect because the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, prohibits commercial surrogacy. Option 3 is incorrect because the MTP Act allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women, with certain exceptions extending the limit to 24 weeks under specific conditions (amended in 2021). This question tests the knowledge of specific legislation related to social issues, requiring precise recall of the key features of each act.  The inclusion of partially correct options (e.g., the MTP Act's time limit) adds to the difficulty and demands a high level of accuracy.


**5. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                      Detail
1.  Reservation in Government jobs             :   Minimum 4% reservation
2.  Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions :   Minimum 5% reservation
3.  Recognized Disabilities                      :   21 types, including acid attack victims.
4.  Free Education                              :   For children with 40% or more specified disability.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and 5% in higher educational institutions for persons with benchmark disabilities. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including those caused by acid attacks.  Free education is provided to children with benchmark disabilities (defined as 40% or more of a specified disability). This question assesses detailed knowledge of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, going beyond general awareness to specific provisions and percentages.  The straightforward nature of the correct matches is balanced by the need for precise factual recall.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Report/Initiative
1.  UNFPA                                        :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2.  UNDESA                                       :   India Ageing Report 2023
3.  UNHCR                                        :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
4.  IFPRI                                         :   Global Food Policy Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The UNDESA released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023, and the IFPRI released the Global Food Policy Report 2023.  The other options are incorrect. UNFPA is known for its State of World Population reports and work on reproductive health, not the forced displacement report. UNHCR focuses on refugees and asylum seekers.  This question tests the understanding of international organizations and their areas of expertise, requiring knowledge of specific reports and publications released by each. The deliberate mismatching of organizations and reports increases the difficulty level.



**7.  With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                      Detail
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target by 2035  :   100% in preschool to secondary level
2.  Multiple exit options in Undergraduate degrees:  Certification after first year, diploma after second.
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)        :   To catalyze and expand research and innovation.
4.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)              :   To store academic credits earned from various institutions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The NEP 2020 does propose multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees (certification, diploma, bachelor's, honors), the establishment of a National Research Foundation (NRF) to boost research and innovation, and the creation of an Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) for storing academic credits.  Option 1 is incorrect; the 100% GER target by 2030 applies to preschool to secondary education, while the NEP aims for at least 50% GER in higher education by 2035. This question tests detailed knowledge of the NEP 2020, requiring specific recall of its features and targets.  The inclusion of a partially correct option (the GER target, though for a different level of education) increases the difficulty.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                  Releasing Organization
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI)                     :   World Economic Forum
2.  Global Gender Gap Index                      :   Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
3.  Gender Social Norms Index                    :   United Nations Development Programme
4.  UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)            :   World Health Organization and World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the United Nations Development Programme, and the UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) is jointly released by the World Health Organization and the World Bank.  The other options are incorrect. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum.  This question tests knowledge of various indices and their releasing organizations, demanding precise recall of the entities involved. The use of similar-sounding names and organizations enhances the challenge.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act                                     Primary Goal
1.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II      :   Achieve 100% mechanized sanitation
2.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system:   Sustain ODF status and implement waste management systems
3.  NAMASTE scheme                               :   Rehabilitate identified manual scavengers
4.  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) :   Promote 100% ODF Plus status in villages

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system aims to achieve 100% mechanized sanitation, and the Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) seeks to rehabilitate identified manual scavengers. The other options misrepresent the primary goals of the schemes.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II focuses on achieving ODF Plus status, not solely on mechanized sanitation. The NAMASTE scheme is also aimed at promoting mechanized sanitation, not rehabilitation of manual scavengers.  This question tests understanding of government schemes related to sanitation, demanding precise knowledge of their objectives. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect distractors increases the complexity.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribal Group                     State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                      :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                       :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                        :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all recognized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  However, the passage explicitly states that the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as PVTGs in *both* Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect as listed,  pair 2 is correct, and pair 3 is incorrect. Option (b) accurately reflects this.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are mentioned as housing PVTGs, but not specifically these three tribes.  The question tests the candidate's ability to precisely recall the geographical distribution of specific PVTGs, highlighting the nuances within a broader understanding of tribal categorization in India.  Incorrect options present plausible distractors by including other states where PVTGs exist, testing the candidate's knowledge beyond simple recall.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Category of Nomadic Tribes     Example Tribe
1. Hunter/trappers                  :   Hakki Pikki
2. Pastoral communities             :   Konda Reddis
3. Peripatetic groups                :   Gujjars

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses the understanding of different types of nomadic communities in India. Hakki Pikki are mentioned as a *semi-nomadic* tribal group, not specifically categorized as hunter/trappers. Konda Reddis are correctly identified as a hunter/gatherer community. Gujjars are accurately classified as a pastoral community.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The inclusion of Hakki Pikki as a distractor in a seemingly plausible category tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between sub-categories within nomadic groups. The options are designed to challenge the candidate's knowledge of specific tribal examples and their classifications.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Disability Covered      Specific Provision
1. Intellectual Disability           :   4% reservation in Government jobs
2. Acid Attack Victims              :   Free education for children aged 6-18
3. Benchmark Disability             :   5% reservation in higher educational institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, covers a wide range of disabilities, including intellectual disabilities and those caused by acid attacks.  The Act mandates reservations for persons with benchmark disabilities (at least 40% disability) in both government jobs and higher education institutions.  Free education is provided for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18. All three pairs correctly match the type of disability with a relevant provision under the Act. The question tests detailed knowledge of the Act's provisions, going beyond a general understanding of its objectives.  The options are designed to test the candidate's precise recall of the percentage of reservations and the age range covered by free education provisions, making it a challenging question.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                        Key Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Provides concessional loans for sanitation equipment
2. Swachhta Udyami Yojana           :   Bans the employment of manual scavengers
3. NAMASTE scheme                    :   Focuses on 100% mechanization of sanitation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses knowledge of Indian government initiatives related to sanitation and the elimination of manual scavenging.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, primarily focuses on banning manual scavenging and providing rehabilitation measures, not direct loans.  Swachhta Udyami Yojana does provide concessional loans, not directly ban manual scavenging.  NAMASTE scheme accurately focuses on 100% mechanization of sanitation.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The inclusion of other schemes as distractors tests the candidate's understanding of the specific features of each initiative.  The options are carefully crafted to challenge the candidate's detailed understanding of these government programs.



**5. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

    Stage of Schooling                 Key Feature
1. Foundational Stage (Ages 3-8)   :   Introduction of vocational education
2. Middle Stage (Ages 11-14)       :   Emphasis on multilingualism
3. Secondary Stage (Ages 14-18)    :   Multiple exit options with certifications

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's comprehension of the NCF-SE's structure and its key features at different stages of schooling.  Vocational education is introduced later in the curriculum, not at the foundational stage.  Multilingualism is a core feature emphasized across the framework, particularly in the middle and secondary stages.  Multiple exit options with certifications are a key feature of the secondary stage, reflecting the flexibility provided by the NCF-SE.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The incorrect pairing serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the framework's implementation across different age groups.  The options are designed to make the question challenging by requiring precise knowledge of the framework's features at specific educational stages.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                         Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                               :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2. UNHCR                              :   India Ageing Report 2023
3. IFPRI                               :   Global Food Policy Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various international organizations and their respective areas of work and publications. The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) focuses on population issues and releases reports related to demographic trends, while UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) primarily deals with refugee issues and displacement.  IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) focuses on food security and related policies.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrect; the India Ageing Report 2023 is associated with UNFPA, not UNHCR.  The incorrect pairing acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the organizations and their reports.  The carefully chosen options challenge the candidate's understanding of these international bodies' activities.


**7. With reference to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following pairs:**

    Framework/Index                       Key Feature
1. Global Indicator Framework (GIF)   :   Developed by MoSPI
2. National Indicator Framework (NIF) :   Includes 248 indicators
3. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Progress Report 2023 : Released by UNDESA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses the candidate's understanding of different frameworks and reports related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The GIF (Global Indicator Framework) is developed by an inter-agency group, not MoSPI. The NIF (National Indicator Framework) has 284 indicators, not 248. The SDGs Progress Report 2023 is accurately linked to UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs).  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The incorrect pairings act as strong distractors, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the frameworks and their key features. The options require precise recall of numerical data and the responsible organization for each framework, making it a challenging question.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                          Key Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index             :   World Bank
2. Gender Social Norms Index           :   United Nations Development Programme
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)   :   World Economic Forum


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various global indices and the organizations responsible for their release.  The Global Gender Gap Index is correctly linked to the World Economic Forum, not the World Bank. The Gender Social Norms Index is accurately associated with the UNDP (United Nations Development Programme). The UHC Service Coverage Index is jointly released by WHO and the World Bank. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The inclusion of the World Economic Forum as a distractor tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding organizations.  The options are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the organizations associated with each index.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Initiative                 Key Feature
1. National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) :  Focuses solely on primary education
2. Performance Grading Index (PGI)       :   Assesses school education at district level only
3. National Credit Framework (NCrF)     :   Integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education
4. Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:  Primarily focuses on funding humanities research


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) is a comprehensive framework that covers all stages of school education, not just primary education.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI) assesses the performance of the school education system at both the state and district levels, making pair 2 incorrect. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, has a broader scope than just funding humanities research; it aims to provide strategic direction for research, innovation, and entrepreneurship across various scientific and technological fields, including the interfaces of humanities and social sciences.  Hence, pair 4 is also incorrect.  Only pair 3 accurately reflects the NCrF's objective of integrating credits earned through various educational pathways, ensuring flexibility and mobility in the educational system. This aligns with the NEP 2020's vision of a holistic and integrated approach to education.


**2. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking/Index                     Key Characteristic
1. Times Higher Education World University Rankings :  Exclusively ranks Indian universities
2. Global 2000 Report                  :   Published by the QS (Quacquarelli Symonds)
3. QS World University Ranking           :   Considers only academic reputation in its ranking methodology
4. National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) : Includes a parameter on "Innovation"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Times Higher Education World University Rankings include universities from across the globe, not just India, making pair 1 incorrect. The Global 2000 Report is published by the Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR), not QS, rendering pair 2 incorrect. The QS World University Ranking utilizes multiple indicators including academic reputation, employer reputation, and faculty research, thus pair 3 is also incorrect.  Only pair 4 is correctly matched.  The NIRF, used for India Rankings of Higher Educational Institutions, incorporates various parameters, including a component focused on "Innovation," reflecting the growing emphasis on this aspect in Indian higher education.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                             Specific Provision
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021    :   Allows only commercial surrogacy
2. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:  Provides for the construction of insanitary latrines
3. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971:  Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women without any conditions
4.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 : Mandates 5% reservation in all government jobs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy and allows only altruistic surrogacy, making pair 1 incorrect. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act aims to eliminate the practice, not promote it by constructing insanitary latrines, thus pair 2 is incorrect.  The MTP Act, while amended, does not allow termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women without conditions; there are specific grounds and gestational limits, rendering pair 3 incorrect.  Only pair 4 correctly identifies a provision of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, which mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities (with exceptions for certain police forces).


**4. With reference to the organizations mentioned in the text, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Mandate/Function
1.  UNFPA                                        :   Focuses on reducing global hunger
2.  UNHCR                                         :   Works primarily with internally displaced persons
3.  World Food Programme (WFP)                     :  Provides food assistance in conflict and disaster zones
4.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA's mandate centers on sexual and reproductive health and rights, not hunger reduction, making pair 1 incorrect.  While UNHCR assists refugees, its work also extends to other forcibly displaced persons, including asylum seekers and internally displaced people, but not exclusively, thus pair 2 is not entirely accurate. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, not the World Food Programme (WFP), making pair 4 incorrect. Only pair 3 accurately describes the WFP's core function of providing food assistance to those affected by conflict or disasters.  This is a crucial aspect of their humanitarian work, aligning with their Nobel Peace Prize recognition.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Initiative                Primary Goal
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                   :  Improve sanitation infrastructure
2.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)           :  Achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in rural areas
3.  Poshan Abhiyan                           :   Promote digital literacy among children
4.  National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE): Reduce stunting and wasting in children


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on providing health insurance and improving healthcare access, not sanitation, making pair 1 incorrect. Poshan Abhiyan aims to improve nutrition levels among children and pregnant women, not promote digital literacy, thus pair 3 is incorrect.  NAMASTE aims to mechanize sanitation and improve sanitation worker safety, not reduce stunting or wasting, rendering pair 4 incorrect.  Only pair 2 correctly identifies the primary goal of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) which is to achieve ODF status in rural areas.  This initiative has significantly impacted sanitation in India.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Reform Initiative        Key Feature
1.  National Accreditation Council (NAC)   :   Meta-accrediting body overseeing accrediting institutions
2.  Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee      :   Recommended transition to a binary accreditation system by December 2023
3.  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 :   Proposed reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Accreditation Council (NAC), as envisioned by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, is designed to function as a meta-accrediting body.  This means it will oversee and supervise other accrediting institutions, ensuring a consistent and high standard of accreditation across higher education.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee played a crucial role in proposing reforms to the accreditation system, including recommending a transition to a binary system (accredited or not accredited) by December 2023. This makes pair 2 correct.  Finally, NEP 2020 itself directly addresses the need for reforms in the higher education accreditation system, making pair 3 also correct.  All three pairs accurately reflect the relationship between the named entities and their key features in the context of higher education reforms in India.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Report Published
1.  World Economic Forum                      :   Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI)
2.  World Health Organization (WHO)           :   Global Gender Gap Index
3.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP):   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
4.  UNHCR                                     :   Gender Social Norms Index

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The World Economic Forum publishes the Global Gender Gap Index, not the UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI).  The WHO, along with the World Bank, publishes the UHC SCI.  The UNHCR publishes the Global Trends: Forced Displacement report, not UNDP. Finally, the UNDP publishes the Gender Social Norms Index.  Each pairing incorrectly attributes a report to the wrong organization.


**3. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   NCrF Component                          Description
1.  Levels 1-4                               :   Higher Education
2.  Levels 4.5-8                             :   Vocational Education & Training
3.  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)          :   Stores credits earned from various educational pathways
4.  Notional Learning Hours                  :   Fixed at 1200 hours/year for all educational levels

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect; levels 1-4 refer to school education, not higher education. Pair 2 is also incorrect;  levels 4.5-8 refer to higher education, not vocational education and training (which spans all levels).  Pair 3 is correct: The Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) is a crucial component of the NCrF, designed to store credits earned through various educational pathways, promoting flexibility and mobility. Pair 4 is also correct: The NCrF establishes a fixed number of notional learning hours (1200 hours/year) for all educational levels to standardize credit allocation. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the National Medical Commission (NMC), consider the following pairs:**

   NMC Related Entity                       Status/Characteristic
1.  World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) :   Grants recognition to individual accrediting agencies
2.  National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023 :   Seeks to repeal the Dentists Act, 1948
3.  National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023       :   Provides for a uniform mechanism for admission into nursing institutions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) is indeed responsible for granting recognition to individual accrediting agencies that meet its criteria.  Pair 2 is incorrect; the NNMC Act, 2023, aims to improve nursing and midwifery education, not repeal the Dentists Act. That's the purpose of the NDC Act. Pair 3 is also incorrect; the NDC Act focuses on dental education and regulation, while the uniform admission mechanism for nursing institutions is a feature of the NNMC Act.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Initiative                  Primary Focus
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                      :   Digital health records and national portability of health services
2.  National Health Policy 2017                  :   Achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC)
3.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush             :   Reducing stunting and wasting among children
4.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)    :  Reaching zero-dose children and pregnant women with missed vaccine doses


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims at achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC).  Pair 1 is incorrect; Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on providing health insurance, not digital health records and portability (that's the role of ABDM). Pair 3 is incorrect; Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets vaccination coverage, not child malnutrition (though related, it’s not the primary focus).  Pair 4 is also incorrect;  the ABDM is a digital health initiative, not focused on vaccination campaigns.  Therefore, only pair 2 accurately reflects the scheme's primary objective.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Key Provision
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 :   Allows surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete is from the intending couple
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :   Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through training and financial assistance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced a significant change by allowing surrogacy with donor gametes under specific conditions, namely that at least one gamete must be from the intending couple.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, indeed focuses on rehabilitating manual scavengers through training and financial aid.  However, pair 2 is incorrect. The MTP Act allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women, with extensions in certain circumstances, not 24 weeks. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to organizations working on child welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Primary Role/Activity
1.  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) :   Manages the PENCiL portal for rescuing child laborers
2.  Bachpan Bachao Andolan                     :   Issues guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offences
3.  Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) :   Governs inter-country and intra-country adoptions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) is indeed the statutory body responsible for governing inter-country and intra-country adoptions in India. Pair 1 is incorrect; the Ministry of Labour and Employment manages the PENCiL portal, not NCPCR. Pair 2 is also incorrect; the NCPCR issues guidelines for assessing child suspects, not Bachpan Bachao Andolan.  Therefore, only pair 3 accurately describes the organization's primary role.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                   Publishing Organization
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI)                      :   Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
2.  Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report :  International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
3.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress Report 2023 :   United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
4.  India Ageing Report 2023                       :  Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is indeed published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. Pair 2 is incorrect; the UNHCR publishes the Global Trends: Forced Displacement report, not IIPS. Pair 3 is also incorrect; the UNFPA publishes the India Ageing Report, not the SDG NIF Progress Report. That report is published by MoSPI. Pair 4 is also incorrect; the MoSPI publishes the SDG NIF Progress Report, not the India Ageing Report.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                     State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                     :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar Tribe                       :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga Tribe                       :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is correctly listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Chhattisgarh.  The Kamar and Baiga tribes are also listed as PVTGs, but they are found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, not exclusively in Madhya Pradesh as option (b) suggests.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, while housing PVTGs, do not specifically include the Baiga tribe. Option (d) is therefore incorrect as it includes an incorrectly matched pair.  Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs Kamar and Baiga with Andaman and Nicobar.  Only option (a) accurately reflects the presence of the Bharia PVTG in Chhattisgarh. The question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups in India.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs     :   Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology :   Use of advanced farming techniques
2. Low level of literacy                 :   High literacy rates
3. Economic backwardness             :   High per capita income
4. Declining or stagnant population    :   Rapid population growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are the opposite of what is presented in the pairs. PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural technology (not advanced farming), low literacy rates (not high), economic backwardness (not high income), and declining or stagnant populations (not rapid growth).  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer. This question assesses the understanding of the criteria used to define PVTGs, requiring factual recall and analytical skills to identify the inaccuracies in the provided pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy Related to Tribal Welfare      :    Key Feature
1. Forest Rights Act, 2006                 :   Denial of habitat rights to PVTGs
2.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871              :   Protection of nomadic tribes
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Legalizes manual scavenging


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, grants, not denies, habitat rights to forest-dwelling tribal communities, including PVTGs. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was notorious for criminalizing and marginalizing nomadic tribes, not protecting them.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to abolish, not legalize, manual scavenging. The question tests factual knowledge of specific legislation concerning tribal welfare and requires analytical skills to identify the inaccuracies in each pair.


**4. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                                     :   True/False
1. All nomadic tribes are DNTs                 :   True
2. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 is still in effect:   True
3. Vimukta Jatis Day is celebrated on August 31st:  False


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correctly matched as false.  Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; DNTs are a subset of nomadic tribes. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed. Vimukta Jatis Day is celebrated on August 31st. Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly identified as false.  This question tests factual recall and requires an understanding of the nuances related to DNTs and their historical context.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme for DNTs          :   Ministry
1.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric Scholarship :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme              :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3.  SEED Scheme                           :   Ministry of Rural Development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme is correctly paired with the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric Scholarship is administered by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The SEED (Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities) scheme also falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  The question assesses knowledge of government schemes and their respective administrative ministries, demanding precise factual recall.


**6. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                    :    Percentage/Number
1. Minimum reservation in Government jobs  :   5%
2.  Number of recognized disabilities      :    10
3. Minimum reservation in higher educational institutions:  4%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and 5% in higher educational institutions for persons with disabilities. However, the number of recognized disabilities is 21, not 10. This question tests factual recall of the provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016, requiring precise knowledge of the percentages of reservation and the number of recognized disabilities.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

  Act Related to Manual Scavenging        :    Key Provision
1. PEMSR Act, 2013                     :   Legalizes manual scavenging
2.  NAMASTE scheme                      :   Promotes 100% mechanization of sanitation
3. Swachhta Udyami Yojana               :  Provides concessional loans for sanitation equipment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The PEMSR Act, 2013, prohibits, not legalizes, manual scavenging. The NAMASTE scheme and the Swachhta Udyami Yojana are correctly paired with their respective key provisions.  This question requires factual recall of legislation and schemes related to manual scavenging and their objectives, testing the understanding of government initiatives to address this issue.



**8. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyaan), consider the following pairs:**

   Component                                    :   Ministry/Agency
1. Anganwadi Services Scheme                 :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2.  Poshan Tracker App                        :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  ICDS-Common Application Software (CAS)  :   UNICEF


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Anganwadi Services Scheme is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The Poshan Tracker app is a component of POSHAN Abhiyaan, managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  The ICDS-CAS is also managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not UNICEF. This question tests factual knowledge of the components of POSHAN Abhiyaan and their administrative structures, requiring precise recall of the relevant ministries/agencies.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 :   Report/Index Released
1. World Economic Forum                     :   Global Hunger Index
2.  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe :   Global Gender Gap Index
3.  World Health Organization (WHO)          :   UHC Service Coverage Index


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index, not the Global Hunger Index. Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe release the Global Hunger Index, not the Global Gender Gap Index. The World Health Organization (WHO) correctly releases the UHC Service Coverage Index.  This question assesses knowledge of international organizations and the indices/reports they publish, requiring precise factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding organizations and indices.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/UT with Highest Number of PVTGs
1. Bharia                                     :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar                                      :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga                                      :   Odisha
4.  Various Tribes                             : Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Odisha houses the highest number (13) of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India.  The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect as they misrepresent the state with the highest number of each specific PVTG. Option 4 is correct because the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have several PVTGs, though the exact number isn't specified in the provided text, the text states that PVTGs are spread across 18 states and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in seemingly plausible pairings.  The inclusion of multiple PVTGs and their presence in multiple states serves as a significant distractor, demanding careful analysis of the provided information.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                   Ministry/Organization
1.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes: Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs: Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED): Ministry of Rural Development
4.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system: Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes is under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (option 1 is incorrect). The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs is indeed under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment (option 2 is correct). The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Rural Development (option 3 is incorrect). The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (option 4 is partially correct, but the question asks for the primary ministry). The question assesses factual recall and understanding of governmental organizational structures and their responsibilities. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect ministry assignments for some schemes serves as a significant distractor, requiring careful evaluation of each pairing.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                     Specific Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs            :   Minimum 5% reservation in all government jobs
2. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities:  Applies to children aged 6-18 with at least 40% disability 
3.  Recognition of Disabilities                 :  Includes only physical disabilities
4.  Reservation in Police forces                :  4% reservation applicable for all police forces

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5% (option 1 is incorrect). The act does specify free education for children with benchmark disabilities (at least 40% disability) between the ages of 6 and 18 (option 2 is correct).  The act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not just physical ones (option 3 is incorrect).  The act explicitly states that reservation is *not* applicable to police forces (option 4 is incorrect). The question tests factual recall regarding specific provisions of the RPwD Act.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect numerical values and the misrepresentation of the scope of disability recognition and police force reservations create effective distractors, requiring careful evaluation and precise knowledge of the Act's content.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:  Allows employment in sewer cleaning with protective gear.
2.  NAMASTE scheme                               :   Focuses solely on solid waste management
3. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                         : Provides financial assistance for sanitation-related equipment procurement.
4.  PEMSR Act                                    :  Demolishes all existing insanitary latrines immediately

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PEMSR Act prohibits employment as manual scavengers, with an exception for those using appropriate protective gear (option 1 is partially correct, but the question focuses on the main intent of the act). The NAMASTE scheme promotes 100% mechanization in various sanitation aspects including sewer and septic tank cleaning, it does not focus solely on solid waste management (option 2 is incorrect). The Swachhta Udyami Yojana does provide concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment (option 3 is correct). The PEMSR Act mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe, not immediate demolition (option 4 is incorrect).  This question tests knowledge of specific acts and policies related to sanitation and manual scavenging.  The partially correct options and the inclusion of misleading statements about the immediate impact of the acts create effective distractors, demanding careful analysis and a nuanced understanding of the subject matter.


**5. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                        Detail
1.  Schooling Structure                          :  Maintains the existing 4-stage structure
2.  Board Examinations                          : Allows students to retake exams only once
3.  Language Proficiency                       :  Students must be proficient in at least two Indian languages
4. Vocational Education                         :  Focuses solely on work with machines

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE proposes a new 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system (option 1 is incorrect).  It allows students to take board exams on at least two occasions, retaining the best score (option 2 is incorrect). It promotes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages (option 3 is incorrect).  Vocational education under the NCF-SE encompasses work with life forms, materials and machines, and human services (option 4 is incorrect).  This question tests detailed knowledge of the NCF-SE's key features.  The incorrect options present plausible but inaccurate details, making it a challenging question that demands precise understanding and recall of the framework's specific provisions.  The difficulty is amplified by the need to identify multiple inaccuracies.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking/Index                                   Organization/Body
1. Global Gender Gap Index                     :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index                  :   World Economic Forum
3. UHC Service Coverage Index                  :   World Health Organization and World Bank
4. Path to Equal Report                          :  International Monetary Fund

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP (option 1 is incorrect). The Gender Social Norms Index is indeed released by the UNDP (option 2 is incorrect). The UHC Service Coverage Index is jointly released by the WHO and the World Bank (option 3 is correct). The Path to Equal Report is jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP, not the IMF (option 4 is incorrect). This question tests knowledge of various global indices and their releasing organizations.  The incorrect options use similar-sounding organizations, creating plausible distractors that require precise knowledge for accurate matching. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar international organizations involved in development and social indicators.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                 Key Provision
1.  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956     : Governs inter-country adoptions of Indian children.
2. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015: Defines a child as a person below 16 years of age.
3. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021                : Allows commercial surrogacy.
4. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005:  Defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

HAMA governs adoption within the Hindu community, not inter-country adoptions (option 1 is incorrect).  The JJ Act defines a child as a person below 18 years of age (option 2 is incorrect). The Surrogacy Act allows only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy (option 3 is incorrect). The PWDVA defines domestic violence as physical, verbal, emotional, economic, or sexual abuse (option 4 is incorrect). This question tests detailed knowledge of various acts related to social welfare.  The incorrect options utilize partially correct information or misleading simplifications of the acts' provisions, creating strong distractors requiring precise knowledge and careful analysis. The difficulty arises from the need to identify multiple inaccuracies in the pairings.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Key Report/Publication
1. UNFPA                                         :   Global Food Policy Report
2. UNDESA                                        :   Sustainable Development Goals Progress Report
3. IFPRI                                          :   State of World Population Report
4. WFP                                           : World Youth Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

UNFPA publishes the State of World Population Report, not the Global Food Policy Report (option 1 is incorrect). UNDESA releases the Sustainable Development Goals Progress Report (option 2 is correct). IFPRI publishes the Global Food Policy Report, not the State of World Population Report (option 3 is incorrect). WFP does not publish the World Youth Report (option 4 is incorrect). This question tests knowledge of various international organizations and their key publications. The incorrect options utilize plausible but incorrect pairings, demanding precise knowledge of the organizations' work and publications.  The difficulty stems from the need for accurate recall of specific reports and their associated organizations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State with Highest PVTG Population
1. Baiga                                      :    Madhya Pradesh
2. Kamar                                      :    Chhattisgarh
3. Bharia                                     :    Odisha
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is indeed listed as a PVTG, but Odisha houses the highest *number* of PVTGs, not necessarily the highest population of any single PVTG.  Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh both have significant populations of the Baiga and Kamar tribes, respectively,  and these tribes are listed as PVTGs in both states.  Option (b) correctly identifies these two accurate pairings. Option (a) is incorrect because while Madhya Pradesh has a large ST population, the question specifically asks about the state with the highest PVTG population of *that specific tribe*. Option (c) is incorrect because Odisha's high number of PVTGs doesn't mean it has the highest population of the Kamar tribe. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the false pairing of Bharia with Odisha. The question highlights the need to carefully distinguish between the total number of PVTGs in a state and the population distribution of individual PVTGs within those states.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs          :     Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology      :      Use of advanced tools and techniques
2. Low level of literacy                     :      High school graduation rates
3. Economic backwardness                  :      High per capita income
4. Declining or stagnant population         :      Rapid population growth

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the given pairs are incorrectly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are precisely the opposite of what is described in the options.  Option (d) is correct because PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural technology (meaning a lack of advanced tools), low literacy rates (not high), economic backwardness (not high per capita income), and a declining or stagnant population (not rapid growth). The question tests the understanding of the characteristics of PVTGs and highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of socio-economic indicators.  It also serves as a strong distractor, as the descriptions in the options seem plausible at first glance but are fundamentally opposite to the reality of PVTG characteristics.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative for Tribal Welfare   :    Primary Focus
1. PM JANMAN                               :    Promoting tourism in tribal areas
2. Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission:   Providing basic amenities to all tribal communities
3.  National Commission for DNTs           :   Empowering De-Notified Tribes
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PM JANMAN focuses on providing basic facilities (housing, water, sanitation, etc.) to PVTG households, aligning with the Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission's broader goal.  The National Commission for DNTs is explicitly tasked with the welfare and empowerment of De-Notified Tribes. Option (b) accurately reflects the primary focus of these two initiatives. Option (a) is incorrect because PM JANMAN does not primarily focus on tourism; its core aim is infrastructure development and basic service provision. Option (c) is partially correct but doesn't encompass the Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission. Option (d) is incorrect because it only includes one of the correctly matched pairs.  The question assesses the understanding of government schemes targeting different tribal groups, testing knowledge beyond just names and emphasizing the policy objectives.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                :   Description
1. Reservation in Government Jobs        :    Minimum 2% reservation
2. Reservation in Higher Education        :    Minimum 5% reservation
3. Recognition of Disabilities            :    10 types of disabilities recognized
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and a minimum of 5% reservation in higher educational institutions for persons with benchmark disabilities.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not just 10. Option (b) correctly identifies the accurate pairing for higher education reservation. Option (a) is incorrect because it provides the wrong percentage for job reservation. Option (c) is incorrect because it combines a correct and an incorrect pairing. Option (d) is incorrect because one pair is correctly matched.  The question tests the knowledge of the specifics of the RPwD Act, emphasizing the importance of accurate numerical data in understanding policy provisions.  The inclusion of incorrect numerical data acts as a significant distractor.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act Related to Manual Scavenging     :     Key Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:   Allows for the continued use of insanitary latrines
2.  PEMSR                                :    Mandates the construction of community sanitary latrines
3. NAMASTE scheme                         :   Focuses solely on urban sanitation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) explicitly bans the employment of manual scavengers and mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines and the construction of community sanitary latrines.  NAMASTE scheme is a broader initiative encompassing mechanized sanitation across both urban and rural areas. Option (b) correctly identifies the key provision of PEMSR. Option (a) is incorrect because PEMSR aims to eliminate, not allow, the continued use of insanitary latrines. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes a partially incorrect statement about NAMASTE's scope. Option (d) is incorrect because one pair is correctly matched. This question assesses the understanding of legislation and schemes concerning manual scavenging, highlighting the difference between specific legal provisions and broader programmatic initiatives.  The distractors use plausible but incorrect descriptions of the acts and schemes.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   NCF-SE Feature                       :    Description
1.  Curriculum Structure                 :   4+3+3+4 structure
2.  Board Examinations                  :   Single opportunity per year
3.  Multilingualism                     :   Proficiency in at least two Indian languages

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling and emphasizes multilingualism, promoting proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.  Board examinations, according to NCF-SE,  allow for multiple attempts. Option (b) correctly identifies the accurate pairings for curriculum structure and multilingualism. Option (a) is partially correct but misses the accurate pairing for multilingualism. Option (c) is incorrect because it misses the correct pairing for the curriculum structure. Option (d) is incorrect because two pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of the key features of the NCF-SE, particularly the structural changes and language policy. The distractors play on potential misunderstandings of the detailed features of the framework.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    :    Primary Mandate
1. UNFPA                                         :   Combating climate change
2. UNDESA                                        :   Promoting sustainable development goals
3. UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC):   Protecting rights of refugees

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

UNDESA is explicitly responsible for supporting the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  UNFPA focuses on sexual and reproductive health, and UNCRC deals with children's rights, not refugee protection (that's UNHCR). Option (b) accurately identifies the primary mandate of UNDESA. Option (a) is incorrect; UNFPA's primary focus is not climate change. Option (c) is incorrect; neither UNFPA nor UNCRC has the mandate described. Option (d) is incorrect because one of the pairs is mismatched.  The question tests knowledge of the mandates of different UN organizations, requiring precise understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities.


**8. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   GHI Indicator                         :      Measurement
1. Undernourishment                    :       Percentage of children under 5 who are stunted
2. Child Stunting                        :       Percentage of underweight children under 5
3. Child Wasting                         :       Percentage of the population who are undernourished

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched.  Undernourishment measures the percentage of the population that is undernourished. Child stunting measures the percentage of children under 5 who are stunted (low height for age). Child wasting measures the percentage of children under 5 who are wasted (low weight for height).  Option (d) is correct because none of the provided pairings accurately reflect the measurements used in the GHI.  The question tests the understanding of the specific metrics used to calculate the GHI, making it challenging due to the potential for confusing similar indicators.  The distractors are designed to exploit this potential for confusion.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Community                     State/Region Primarily Associated
1. Reang                               :   Mizoram
2. Bru                                  :   Tripura
3. Siddis                               :   Gujarat and Karnataka
4. Koraga                               :   Kerala and Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Reang community primarily resides in Tripura, not Mizoram, making pair 1 incorrect.  The Bru community is indeed found in Tripura, making pair 2 partially correct as it also has presence in other countries.  The Siddis are predominantly found in Gujarat and Karnataka, making pair 3 correct.  The Koraga community is primarily located in Kerala and Karnataka, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall about the geographical distribution of different tribal communities in India, a common theme in UPSC examinations. The distractors are designed to be plausible, as the mentioned states are indeed associated with these tribes, but not as the primary region.  The question requires careful consideration and knowledge of specific geographical distribution to avoid being misled by the distractors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Vulnerable Group Category          Criterion
1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :   Pre-industrial level of technology
2. De-Notified Tribes (DNTs)           :   Nomadic lifestyle
3. Scheduled Tribes (STs)              :   Declining population

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The defining criteria for PVTGs include pre-agricultural levels of technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  While nomadic lifestyles are often associated with DNTs, it is not the sole defining criterion.  Many STs may also experience declining populations, but this is not the defining characteristic that sets them apart.  Thus, only pairs 1 and 2 reflect core criteria for the respective categories. The question assesses conceptual understanding of the criteria used to classify vulnerable groups and requires the candidate to differentiate between defining characteristics and frequently associated features. The distractors are designed to be plausible by using related but not perfectly accurate characteristics.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                 Key Feature
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Provides financial assistance for rehabilitation
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Mandates reservation in government jobs
3.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :   Defines domestic violence broadly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PEMSR Act of 2013 focuses on the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, including financial aid and alternative employment. The RPwD Act of 2016 mandates reservations for PwDs in both higher education and government jobs.  The PWDVA of 2005 provides a comprehensive definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, sexual, emotional, and economic abuse. All three pairs accurately reflect key features of the respective legislation. This question tests factual recall of the provisions of important social welfare legislation, a recurring theme in the UPSC exam.  The options are designed to make the candidate carefully consider each pair, testing their knowledge of the acts and avoiding easy guessing.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry                                        Scheme/Initiative
1. Ministry of Tribal Affairs                      :   National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes
2. Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment    :   National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem
3. Ministry of Women and Child Development   :   Poshan Abhiyan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed responsible for the National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes.  The Ministry of Women and Child Development is responsible for the Poshan Abhiyan. However, the National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, not solely under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of the administrative structure of government schemes related to social welfare, a crucial aspect of UPSC preparation.  The distractor involving the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is designed to be convincing, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                       Key Organization Involved
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                         :   Concern Worldwide
2. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) :   World Bank
3. Global Gender Gap Index                           :   United Nations Development Programme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Concern Worldwide is one of the organizations that publishes the Global Hunger Index. The World Bank, in collaboration with the WHO, publishes the Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index. The Global Gender Gap Index, however, is published by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of various indices and reports related to social development and their associated organizations, a frequently tested area in the UPSC exam.  The distractor involving UNDP is designed to be plausible given its involvement in gender-related issues.


**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Area of Focus                                     Specific Feature
1. Foundational Stage (Ages 3-8)                 :   Introduction of vocational education
2. Preparatory Stage (Ages 8-11)                 :   Emphasis on multilingualism (at least three languages)
3. Middle Stage (Ages 11-14)                     :   Separate area of study for environmental education
4. Secondary Stage (Ages 14-18)                 :   Development of capacities for scientific inquiry


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE, released by the Ministry of Education, outlines a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.  Option (c) correctly identifies two key features. The Middle Stage (ages 11-14) indeed culminates in a separate area of study dedicated to environmental education. Similarly, the Secondary Stage (ages 14-18) emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry, going beyond mere knowledge acquisition.  Option (1) is incorrect as vocational education is introduced later in the schooling structure, not in the foundational stage. Option (2) is partially correct in that multilingualism is emphasized, but its specific emphasis is not limited to the preparatory stage alone; it spans across the entire schooling system. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the false pairings of options 1 and 2.  The NCF-SE aims for a holistic approach to education, integrating various aspects across different stages, making a simple stage-wise categorization of its features misleading.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system, consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                             Key Finding
1. 2017-18                                        :   Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade (Daksh)
2. 2021-22                                        :   Reduction in the deviation between maximum and minimum scores obtained by States/UTs to 23.8%
3. 2020-21 & 2021-22 (PGI-D)                   :   All districts attained the top two grades (Daksh and Utkarsh)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PGI, released by the Ministry of Education, assesses the performance of the school education system. Option (b) is correct because it accurately reflects a key finding from the 2021-22 PGI 2.0 report: a significant reduction in the disparity of scores between the highest and lowest performing states/UTs.  Option (1) is incorrect; no state/UT achieved the highest grade (Daksh) in either 2017-18 or 2021-22.  In 2021-22, Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade amongst all states/UTs, but that grade was Prachesta-2, not Daksh. Option (3) is incorrect; the PGI-D report for 2020-21 and 2021-22 explicitly states that *no* districts achieved the top two grades (Daksh and Utkarsh).  The PGI uses a ten-grade classification system, and the absence of any state/district achieving the top grades in certain years is a notable feature of the index.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for higher education, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Area                                      Specific Target/Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)                     :   At least 100% by 2035
2. Undergraduate Degrees                           :   Single exit option after 3 years
3. Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) :   Establishment across the country to enhance research


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 brought significant changes to higher education in India. Option (c) correctly points out that the policy envisages the establishment of MERUs across the country to foster multidisciplinary education and research.  Option (1) is incorrect; the NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, not 100%.  Option (2) is also incorrect; the NEP 2020 introduces *multiple* exit options for undergraduate degrees (certification after the first year, diploma after the second, bachelor's degree after the third, and honours degree after the fourth).  The NEP's focus on flexibility and multiple pathways within higher education distinguishes it from traditional rigid structures.


**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation/Act                                   Provision
1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2019 :   Allowed institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtbU status
2. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 :   Prohibited institutions from starting new courses without prior approval
3. UGC Act 1956                                      :   Provides for the Central Government to declare any institution as a DtbU


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The regulations governing DtBUs have evolved over time. Option (c) is correct as the UGC Act of 1956 provides the legal framework for the Central Government to grant the status of a deemed-to-be university to eligible institutions.  Option (1) is incorrect; the 2019 regulations *did not* allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtbU status; this provision was introduced in the 2023 regulations. Option (2) is also incorrect; while the 2023 regulations emphasize quality and excellence, they do not prohibit institutions from starting new courses without prior approval; rather, they specify a process requiring approval from the Executive Council and relevant statutory councils. The evolution of the regulations reflects a continuous effort to refine the criteria and processes for granting DtbU status.


**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

    Framework                                      Characteristic
1. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) :   Exclusively covers vocational and skill education
2. National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)     :   Integrates credits earned through school education
3. National Curriculum Framework (NCF)/National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF):  Covers only higher education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF aims to create a unified credit system for education. Option (b) is correct because the NSQF explicitly aims to integrate credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational/skill education.  Option (1) is incorrect; the NHEQF covers higher education, not exclusively vocational and skill education. The NSQF addresses the skill development aspect. Option (3) is also incorrect; the NCF/NSEQF focuses on school education, not solely higher education.  The NCrF's strength lies in its integrative approach, bringing together different qualification frameworks to provide greater flexibility and mobility for learners.


**6. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Index, consider the following pairs:**

    Year                                        Key Finding
1. 2023                                        : India ranked 146th out of 146 countries.
2. 2023                                        :  India achieved 44.4% women's representation in local governance.
3. 2024                                        : India's ranking improved significantly from the previous year.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index, released annually by the World Economic Forum, measures gender equality across various dimensions. Option (b) is correct as it accurately reflects that in 2023, India achieved 44.4% women's representation in local governance. Option (1) is incorrect; in 2023, India's ranking was 127th out of 146 countries, not 146th. Option (3) is also incorrect; while the index fluctuates yearly, there's no information provided to support a significant improvement in India's ranking in 2024 from the previous year.  The index uses four parameters (Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; Political Empowerment) to assess gender parity, and India's performance varies across these parameters.


**7. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) National Indicator Framework (NIF), consider the following pairs:**

    Year/Organization                                       Key Feature
1.  NIF, 2023                                                : Includes 248 indicators, with 231 unique indicators.
2.  Global Indicator Framework (GIF)                          : Developed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs)
3.  IAEG-SDGs                                                : India represented Southern Asia during 2015-2017 only.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NIF aligns with the global SDGs and includes country-specific indicators. Option (b) is correct as the GIF is indeed framed by the IAEG-SDGs. This inter-agency group plays a crucial role in defining the global indicators for monitoring progress on the SDGs. Option (1) is incorrect; the NIF 2023 includes 284 indicators, not 248. The GIF, on the other hand, includes 248 indicators with 231 unique ones.  Option (3) is also incorrect; India represented Southern Asia in the IAEG-SDGs for multiple terms, including 2015-2017, 2017-2019, and 2021-2023. The NIF and GIF work in tandem to provide a comprehensive framework for tracking progress towards the SDGs at both the national and global levels.


**8. With reference to the  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

    Body/Fund                                      Characteristic
1. Governing Board                                   : Prime Minister serves as the Vice-President
2. Anusandhan NRF Fund                             : Primarily for funding research projects
3. Science and Engineering Research Fund           : Continuation of projects initiated under the SERB Act, 2008


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Anusandhan NRF Act, 2023, established a new framework for research in India. Option (b) is correct; the Science and Engineering Research Fund under the NRF ensures the continuation of projects started under the SERB Act, 2008. Option (1) is incorrect; the Prime Minister serves as the President of the Governing Board, not the Vice-President.  Option (2) is also incorrect; the Anusandhan NRF Fund is meant for salaries, allowances, and administrative expenses, not primarily for research project funding.  The NRF's structure and funding mechanisms aim to provide strategic direction and support for research, innovation, and entrepreneurship across various scientific and technological domains.


**9. With reference to the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), consider the following pairs:**

    ODF Status Category                                 Definition
1. ODF                                                : Every household and public/community institution uses safe technology for faecal disposal.
2. ODF Plus                                           :  Sustained ODF status with only solid waste management systems implemented.
3. ODF Plus Model Village                            : Sustained ODF status with arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and IEC messages.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) aims to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status and beyond. Option (d) is correct; all three pairs accurately define the different categories of ODF status.  ODF signifies the complete absence of open defecation, with safe disposal mechanisms in place. ODF Plus indicates sustained ODF status with additional waste management systems.  The ODF Plus Model Village goes a step further, incorporating visual cleanliness and IEC (Information, Education, and Communication) messages.  These stages represent a progressive approach towards comprehensive sanitation and hygiene.  The distinctions between these categories highlight the mission's multifaceted approach to rural sanitation.


**10. With reference to  Child Labour in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                                    Key Provision/Feature
1. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016:  Permits employment of children below 14 years in certain industries
2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme  :  Focuses solely on providing financial aid to child labourers' families
3. PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal:  Managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Addressing child labour requires a multi-pronged approach.  All the given pairs are mismatched. Option (1) is incorrect; the 2016 amendment *prohibits* the employment of children below 14 years in all employments, not permits it. Option (2) is incorrect; the NCLP scheme focuses on rehabilitation and education, not solely financial aid. Option (3) is also incorrect; the PENCiL portal is managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  The fight against child labour involves legal frameworks, rehabilitation initiatives, and technological tools to monitor and combat this issue effectively.  The mismatches highlight the complexities and nuances of tackling child labour.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                    State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                             :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                              :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                               :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4.  Highest number of PVTGs                : Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  While they are present in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the question plays on the possibility of assuming they are exclusive to one state.  Option (c) is correct because Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs in India (13). The inclusion of Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a possible location for Baiga PVTG is a distractor;  Baiga is present in other states but not Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  The other options are incorrect because they wrongly associate the PVTGs with specific states based on partial knowledge.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern correct information from plausible distractors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Feature
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Punishment with imprisonment up to 5 years
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Reservation for PwDs in police forces
3.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005    : Defines domestic violence only as physical abuse

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prescribes a maximum imprisonment of 2 years, not 5. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, explicitly excludes reservation for PwDs in police forces. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, defines domestic violence broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of key legislation concerning vulnerable groups.  The incorrect options are designed to be plausible distractors, based on possible misunderstandings or incomplete knowledge of the acts.


**3. With reference to Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Category                                       Characteristic
1.  Scheduled Tribes (STs)                      :  Madhya Pradesh has the lowest population in absolute numbers.
2.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :  Identified based on pre-industrial technology and high literacy rates.
3.  De-notified Tribes (DNTs)                   :  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched. Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of STs in absolute numbers. PVTGs are identified based on pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; rather, all DNTs are nomadic tribes. The question tests factual knowledge about the categorization and characteristics of different tribal groups in India. The incorrect options utilize common misconceptions about these groups to create plausible distractors.


**4. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Aspect                                  Target/Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education :  At least 25% by 2035
2. Undergraduate Degrees                         :  Only 4-year duration
3.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                 :  Digitally stores academic credits earned from various institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, not 25%.  Undergraduate degrees under NEP 2020 can be either 3 or 4 years, offering multiple exit options. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is indeed designed to digitally store academic credits. The question assesses knowledge of the NEP 2020's key features, testing factual recall and the ability to identify accurate information from misleading options. The distractors are crafted based on potential misinterpretations of the policy's goals.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Key Function/Report
1.  UNHCR                                        :  Released the ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2021 Report’
2.  UNFPA                                         :  Focuses primarily on combating hunger globally
3.  GANHRI                                        :  Accredits National Human Rights Institutions based on the  "Kyoto Principles"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The UNHCR released the report on Forced Displacement in 2022, not 2021. UNFPA focuses on sexual and reproductive health, not hunger. GANHRI uses the Paris Principles, not Kyoto Principles, for accreditation. This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their respective mandates and activities. The incorrect options include plausible distractors, playing on the potential for confusion between similar organizations and their functions.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between organizations with similar-sounding names or overlapping concerns.


**6. With reference to Manual Scavenging, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                          Definition/Characteristic
1.  Manual Scavenger                            :  Exclusively refers to individuals employed by municipalities.
2.  PEMSR Act, 2013                             :  Allows for the construction of insanitary latrines under certain conditions.
3.  Safal Karamcharis                           :  Are not considered manual scavengers.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched. Manual scavengers include individuals employed in various capacities, not just municipalities. The PEMSR Act, 2013, prohibits the construction of insanitary latrines and mandates their demolition or conversion. Safal Karamcharis, who work as sweepers or cleaning workers, are considered manual scavengers. The question tests detailed knowledge of the terminology and legislation related to manual scavenging, demanding precise factual recall and understanding of the nuances of the definitions.  The incorrect options are designed to be misleading distractors, playing on partial or incomplete knowledge of the topic.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                    Key Feature/Finding
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023             : India ranked among the top 20 countries in hunger reduction.
2.  Global Gender Gap Index 2023              : Measures only economic participation of women.
3.  UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) 2021       : India's score increased compared to 2019.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched. In the GHI 2023, India's ranking indicated a "serious" hunger situation, not a top 20 placement. The Global Gender Gap Index measures multiple dimensions of gender equality, not just economic participation. India's UHC SCI score declined in 2021 compared to 2019. This question tests knowledge of various indices and reports related to social development, requiring accurate recall of key findings and an understanding of their methodologies. The distractors are carefully chosen to represent potential misinterpretations or incomplete knowledge of the indices.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Initiative                     Focus Area
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                         :  Focuses solely on tertiary healthcare
2.  National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) :  Aims to reduce stunting only in urban areas
3.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush                :  Targets only children aged 0-2 years for vaccinations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched. Ayushman Bharat Yojana covers primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare. POSHAN Abhiyan targets to reduce stunting across both rural and urban areas. Intensified Mission Indradhanush aims to vaccinate children aged 0-5 years and pregnant women. The question assesses knowledge of major government schemes, testing factual recall and understanding of their scope and objectives.  Distractors are included to test the candidate's grasp of the nuances of each scheme's implementation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                     State
1. Bharia PVTG                     :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                      :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga Tribe                       :   Odisha
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  The Kamar and Baiga tribes are also listed as PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Therefore, only the pairing of Bharia PVTG with Chhattisgarh is incorrect, as Bharia is also found in Madhya Pradesh. Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs but does not exclusively house the Baiga tribe, which is also present in other states.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic                     Description
1. Initial Designation                :   Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs)
2. Year of First Recognition          :   1973
3. Renaming Year                     :   2006
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961). In 2006, the Government of India renamed the PTGs as PVTGs. All three pairs are correctly matched, reflecting the historical evolution of the PVTG designation and the criteria used for identification.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nomadic/Semi-Nomadic Group    Characteristic
1. Hakki Pikki Tribe                :   Hunter/Trapper
2. Konda Reddis                    :   Semi-nomadic
3. Pardis                           :   Pastoral Community
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka. Konda Reddis are a hunter-gatherer community. Pardis are a pastoral community.  Option (a) is incorrect because Hakki Pikki are semi-nomadic, not hunter-gatherers. Option (b) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair of Hakki Pikki with hunter-gatherers. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair of Hakki Pikki with hunter-gatherers.


**4. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Commission                  Description
1. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871        :   Repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
2. Renke Commission, 2008          :   Estimated 15 crore Indians belong to DNTs/NTs
3. Idate Commission Report         :   Recommended establishing a permanent commission for DNTs
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which labeled certain communities as "born criminals," was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. The Renke Commission of 2008 estimated the population of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs to be around 15 crore. The Idate Commission Report recommended the establishment of a permanent commission to address the issues faced by DNTs. All three pairs are accurately matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                Focus Area
1. Dr. Ambedkar Scholarship        :   Economic Empowerment of DNTs
2. Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme          :   Construction of Hostels for DNTs
3. SEED Scheme                      :   Health Insurance for DNT families
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship scheme focuses on improving educational empowerment for DNTs.  The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme focuses on the construction of hostels for DNT boys and girls. The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) provides free competitive exam coaching and health insurance to DNT families. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes the Dr. Ambedkar scholarship. Option (b) is incorrect as it misses the SEED scheme's health insurance component. Option (d) is incorrect because it wrongly associates the Dr. Ambedkar scholarship with economic empowerment.


**6. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Area                                 Provision
1. Reservation in Government Jobs     :   Not less than 5%
2. Reservation in Higher Education    :   Not less than 4%
3. Police Forces Reservation          :   Applicable
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016 mandates not less than 4% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in government jobs and not less than 5% reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions.  Importantly, the reservation is *not* applicable to police forces. Option (a) is incomplete. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the false statement about police force reservation. Option (d) is incorrect for the same reason.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                     Key Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Bans manual scavenging
2.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system   :   Focuses on 100% mechanization of sanitation
3. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                 :   Provides concessional loans for sanitation equipment
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 explicitly bans the practice of manual scavenging. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning and promote 100% mechanization.  The Swachhta Udyami Yojana offers concessional loans for procuring sanitation-related equipment. All three pairs correctly link the act/scheme with its primary focus. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete.


**8. With reference to the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) Report, consider the following pairs (Note:  These are hypothetical pairs for illustrative purposes only; actual NFHS-5 data should be referenced for accurate matching):**

   Indicator                             Value (Hypothetical)
1. Total Fertility Rate                  :   1.8
2.  Percentage of Women using Contraceptives :   60%
3.  Prevalence of Anemia among Women     :   45%
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:**  (b) or (c) or (d)  (This question uses hypothetical data and therefore, any option could be correct depending on the actual NFHS-5 findings.  The purpose is to illustrate the question format with potentially difficult-to-verify data.)

**Explanation:**

This question highlights the importance of verifying data from official sources.  Since the provided values are hypothetical, any of the options could be correct or incorrect, depending on the actual NFHS-5 report.  This underscores the need for careful data verification in UPSC preparation.  The correct answer would require consulting the official NFHS-5 report.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                            Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                 :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2. UNHCR                                :   India Ageing Report 2023
3.  UNDESA                              :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) releases the State of World Population report, not the forced displacement report.  The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) releases the Global Trends report, not the India Ageing Report. The UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report.  Only the pairing of UNDESA with the SDG report is correct. Option (a) is incorrect. Option (b) is incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect.


**10. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                  GHI Score (Hypothetical)
1. 2015                                 :   29.5
2. 2023                                 :   28.2
3.  2024                                 :   27.8
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) or (c) or (d) (This question uses hypothetical data and therefore, any option could be correct depending on the actual GHI findings. The purpose is to illustrate the question format with potentially difficult-to-verify data.)

**Explanation:**

This question again emphasizes the need for accurate data verification. The GHI scores provided are hypothetical, and their accuracy would need to be checked against the official GHI reports. This question highlights the importance of consulting reliable sources when dealing with statistical data in the UPSC exam.  The correct answer depends entirely on the actual GHI data.



**11. Consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Institution     Status/Ranking
1. Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore :   Top-ranked Indian University in Times Higher Education 2024
2. IIT Bombay                         :    Ranked in the 501-600 bracket in Times Higher Education 2024
3.  University of Oxford               :   Top-ranked University Globally in Times Higher Education 2024
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

IISc Bangalore was indeed the top-ranked Indian university in the Times Higher Education 2024 rankings, but it fell within the 201-250 bracket, not the top spot overall. IIT Bombay was ranked in the 149th position in QS World University Ranking 2024, not in the 501-600 bracket in the Times Higher Education rankings.  Only the pairing of the University of Oxford with the top global ranking is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) all contain at least one incorrect pairing.


**12. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Goal                                       Target Year
1. Achieve 50% GER in Higher Education             :   2035
2. Achieve 100% GER in Pre-school to Secondary Level   :    2030
3.  Increase Public Investment to 6% of GDP           :   2025 (hypothetical)
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 aims to achieve a 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education by 2035 and 100% GER in preschool to secondary level by 2030. The year for achieving 6% GDP investment in education is not explicitly stated as 2025 in NEP 2020; it is a target to be achieved "at the earliest". Option (a) is incomplete. Option (c) is incorrect due to the hypothetical date for GDP investment. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccurate timeline for GDP investment.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

   National Commission/Authority             Mandate/Function
1. National Medical Commission (NMC)     :   Oversees paramedical education
2. National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC): Oversees medical education
3.  National Dental Commission (NDC)       :   Regulates dental education and profession
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Medical Commission (NMC) primarily oversees medical education and practice. The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) regulates nursing and midwifery education. The National Dental Commission (NDC) regulates dental education and the profession.  Only the pairing of NNMC and NDC with their respective mandates are correct. Option (a) is incorrect. Option (b) is incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect.


**14. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   Level                                      Educational Stage
1. Levels 1-4                               :   Higher Education
2. Levels 4.5-8                             :   School Education
3.  Vocational Education and Training      :   Levels 1-8
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

In the NCrF, levels 1-4 correspond to school education, while levels 4.5-8 represent higher education.  Vocational education and training encompass levels 1-8.  Only the pairings of levels 4.5-8 with school education and vocational education with levels 1-8 are correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain at least one incorrect pairing.


**15. Consider the following pairs:**

   Accreditation Body/System                   Description
1. NAAC                                      :   Binary Accreditation System (Accredited/Not Accredited)
2.  NABET                                     :   School Quality Assessment and Accreditation
3.  UGC                                       :   Accords recognition to HEIs under UGC Act, 1956
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) indeed uses a binary accreditation system. NABET (National Accreditation Board for Education and Training) offers accreditation programs for schools. The University Grants Commission (UGC) is responsible for recognizing higher education institutions under the UGC Act of 1956. All three pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Legislation                                    Key Provision/Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021              :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy
2. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 : Defines domestic violence to include emotional abuse
3. Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956          :   Prohibits commercial sex work
4. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a child as a person below 18 years of age
5. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Bans manual scavenging

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly legalizes only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, offers a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, aims to curb immoral trafficking, including sex work. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a "child" as someone below 18 years. Finally, the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, outlaws the practice of manual scavenging.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, and only option (d) accurately reflects the correct matching of all five pairs.


**2. With reference to child welfare legislation in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Legislation                                      Specific Provision
1. POCSO Act, 2012                                   :   Sets the age of consent for sexual activity at 18
2. Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956        :   Governs adoption among Hindus
3. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 : Prohibits employment of children below 14 years
4.  The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994   : Criminalizes commercial organ trade involving children
5. Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976        : Aims to eradicate bonded labour, including child bonded labour


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a key provision of the respective legislation. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, establishes 18 as the age of consent. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, specifically addresses adoption within the Hindu community. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children under 14. The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, criminalizes commercial organ trading, which often involves children.  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, aims to eliminate bonded labour, a system that frequently exploits children.  Therefore, option (d) is the only option that correctly matches all five pairs.


**3. With reference to the rights and welfare of vulnerable groups in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                       Key Focus/Provision
1.  Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 :  Provides for a certificate of identity based on self-perceived gender
2. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016      :   Mandates 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs
3.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system : Aims to eliminate manual scavenging
4.  PM JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan) : Focuses on saturating PVTG households with basic facilities
5.  The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 :  Protects Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from atrocities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, allows individuals to self-identify their gender and obtain a certificate reflecting this. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system directly addresses the elimination of manual scavenging. PM JANMAN aims to provide basic facilities to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, offers legal protection against atrocities faced by Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer encompassing all the accurate pairings.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Body                            Function/Mandate
1.  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) : Issues guidelines for assessment of child suspects in heinous offences
2.  Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA)  :   Governs inter-country and intra-country adoptions
3.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) : Prepares state-wise lists of castes belonging to DNTs
4.  University Grants Commission (UGC)            :  Accredits higher education institutions
5.  National Medical Commission (NMC)              : Oversees medical education and practice in India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched.  NCPCR's role includes issuing guidelines for the assessment of child suspects. CARA is the nodal body for adoption matters. NCDNT is responsible for preparing state-wise lists of Denotified Tribes. UGC plays a crucial role in accrediting higher educational institutions.  The NMC is the regulatory body for medical education and practice.  Option (d) accurately reflects the functions of all five organizations.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete.


**5. With reference to Government Schemes and Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                                    Ministry/Department
1.  Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)   : Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme      : Ministry of Labour and Employment
3.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)                 : Ministry of Jal Shakti
4.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0               : Ministry of Women and Child Development
5.  National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR)   : Ministry of Education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  PMKVY falls under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. NCLP is implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Employment.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) is under the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 is a scheme of the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Finally, NDEAR is an initiative of the Ministry of Education.  Therefore, option (d), encompassing all correct matches, is the only accurate answer.  Other options are incomplete.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Ministry
1. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                 :   Ministry of Rural Development
2. National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) :   Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
3. Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Swachhta Udyami Yojana is indeed related to sanitation, but it falls under the purview of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation (now merged with the Ministry of Jal Shakti).  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The NAMASTE scheme is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), making statement 2 partially correct, as MoHUA is involved.  The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) directly aims at rehabilitating manual scavengers and is implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, making statement 3 correct. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Key Feature
1. Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006 :   Sets the minimum age of marriage at 18 for women and 20 for men
2. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) :   Recognizes 20 types of disabilities
3. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PCMA sets the minimum age of marriage at 18 for women and 21 for men, not 20 for men, making statement 1 incorrect. The RPwD Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 20, rendering statement 2 incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, correctly focuses solely on altruistic surrogacy, making statement 3 correct.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Primary Mandate/Focus
1. Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) :   Oversees ethical and legal adoptions in India, both in-country and inter-country
2. National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission :   Provides inexpensive, speedy, and summary redressal of consumer disputes
3.  World Food Programme (WFP)              :   Combats hunger and provides food assistance globally

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

CARA's primary function is indeed managing adoptions in India, both domestically and internationally, aligning perfectly with statement 1. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission accurately handles consumer disputes efficiently, matching statement 2. The World Food Programme (WFP) is globally recognized for its crucial role in fighting hunger and providing food aid, making statement 3 correct.  Therefore, all three statements (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Tribal welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                          Definition/Characteristic
1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :   First recognized in 1975
2. De-notified Tribes (DNTs)                    :   Communities 'notified' as 'born criminal' during British rule
3.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) :   Prepares a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs were first recognized in 1973, not 1975, making statement 1 incorrect. The description of DNTs as communities labeled "born criminal" during British rule is accurate, correctly matching statement 2. The NCDNT's mandate includes preparing a state-wise list of DNT castes, aligning with statement 3. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Element                                  Feature
1.  5+3+3+4 Structure                          :   Divides schooling into four stages based on age groups
2.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)               :   Digitally stores academic credits earned from various institutions
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)         :   Focuses primarily on school-level education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 5+3+3+4 structure in NEP 2020 accurately divides schooling into four stages based on age groups, making statement 1 correct. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is designed to digitally store academic credits, aligning with statement 2.  However, the National Research Foundation (NRF) is focused on higher education and research, not solely on school-level education, making statement 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                 Provision
1.  97th Constitutional Amendment Act 2011     :   Established the right to form cooperative societies as a fundamental right (Article 19)
2.  MTP (Amendment) Act 2021                   :   Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) :   Bans manual scavenging but allows it with protective gear

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act 2011 correctly established the right to form cooperative societies as a fundamental right under Article 19, making statement 1 accurate. The MTP (Amendment) Act 2021 allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women, not 24, making statement 2 incorrect.  The PEMSR Act accurately bans manual scavenging except when done with protective gear, making statement 3 correct.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to healthcare initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Focus Area
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                      :   Focuses solely on tertiary healthcare
2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)     :   Improves equitable access to quality healthcare using technology
3.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush            :   Aims to increase vaccination coverage

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a comprehensive healthcare scheme encompassing primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, making statement 1 incorrect. The ABDM effectively utilizes technology to improve healthcare access, correctly matching statement 2. Intensified Mission Indradhanush directly aims to improve vaccination rates, aligning with statement 3. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                    Releasing Organization(s)
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                     :   Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
2. Global Gender Gap Index                       :   World Bank
3.  Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI) :   WHO and World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The GHI is indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, making statement 1 correct. The Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not the World Bank, making statement 2 incorrect. The UHC Service Coverage Index is a joint effort of WHO and the World Bank, aligning with statement 3. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Act                                     Ministry/Body
1.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0      :     Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme :     Ministry of Labour and Employment
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :    Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
4.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan   :    Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme falls under the purview of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, focusing on improving the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme is a Central Sector scheme under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, aiming to rehabilitate child laborers. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, is indeed managed by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, working towards the eradication of manual scavenging and the rehabilitation of those affected.  However, the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) is primarily implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, although the latter plays a significant role in its success through collaborative efforts.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair related to POSHAN Abhiyan.


**2. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

    Educational Stage                            Age Group
1. Foundational Stage                            :   3-11 years
2. Preparatory Stage                             :   8-11 years
3. Middle Stage                                 :   11-14 years
4. Secondary Stage                              :   14-18 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.  While the Middle Stage (11-14 years) and Secondary Stage (14-18 years) are correctly matched in option (c), the Foundational Stage encompasses ages 3-8, not 3-11 as stated in pair 1. Similarly, the Preparatory Stage covers ages 8-11 years, but option (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include the mismatched pairs. The correct age ranges for the educational stages reflect the framework's intent to provide a more holistic and developmentally appropriate learning experience, aligning with the overall goals of the National Education Policy 2020.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                      Key Provision
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021            :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :    Allows abortion up to 24 weeks for all women
3.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :    Mandates 5% reservation in government jobs for all categories of disabilities
4.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016 :   Prohibits employment of children below 18 years in all employment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, correctly focuses on allowing only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy.  The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women and beyond 20 weeks under certain conditions, making option 2 incorrect. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, does mandate reservations in government jobs for persons with disabilities but not necessarily 5% for all categories.  The Child Labour Act correctly prohibits the employment of children below 14 years but not below 18 years as stated. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are completely accurately matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include mismatched pairs.


**4. With reference to the Anganwadi System, consider the following pairs:**

    Worker Category                                  Key Responsibility
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)                         :   Provides curative care and supplies
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)                 :   Focuses on promotion of Maternal and Child Health
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA)      :   Provides early childhood care and development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) primarily focuses on the promotion of Maternal and Child Health, including immunizations and institutional-based deliveries, making pair 2 correctly matched.  However, Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) primarily provide early childhood care and development, not curative care and supplies, making pair 1 incorrect.  Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) are community health workers who create awareness and counsel families, but their core role is not providing early childhood care and development, which is the primary function of AWWs.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                    Key Publication/Report
1.  UNFPA                                          :   Global Report on Food Crisis
2.  World Food Programme (WFP)                   :   State of World Population report
3.  IFPRI                                           :    Global Food Policy Report 2023
4.  UNDESA                                         :    Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) correctly publishes the Global Food Policy Report, and the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report.  However, the UNFPA's key publication is the State of World Population report, not the Global Report on Food Crisis, which is associated with the World Food Programme (WFP). Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                      Releasing Organization
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                         :   Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
2. Global Gender Gap Index                           :   United Nations Development Programme
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)                :   World Economic Forum
4. Gender Social Norms Index                        :    WHO and World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is correctly linked to Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The other options incorrectly pair the indices and reports with their releasing organizations.  The Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. The UHC Service Coverage Index is a joint product of WHO and the World Bank, not the World Economic Forum.  The Gender Social Norms Index is published by the UNDP, not WHO and World Bank.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for School Education System, consider the following pairs:**

    Grade                                          Description
1.  Daksh                                          :   Lowest grade
2.  Utkarsh                                        :   Second highest grade
3.  Akanshi-3                                      :   Highest grade
4.  Prachesta-2                                   :   Second lowest grade

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.  Daksh represents the highest grade in the PGI, not the lowest. Utkarsh is the second-highest grade, not the second lowest. Akanshi-3 is the lowest grade, not the highest. Prachesta-2 is a mid-range grade, neither second highest nor second lowest. The PGI uses a ten-grade system to assess school education performance, and the order of grades is clearly defined in decreasing order of performance. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Instrument                                 Key Focus
1.  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA) 1956 :   Inter-country adoption of children
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :   Regulation of surrogacy
3.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021          :   Adoption of orphaned, abandoned children
4.  Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 :   Adoption and maintenance among Hindus

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956, primarily deals with adoption and maintenance among Hindus.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, regulates ART clinics and banks, including surrogacy, but not adoption. The Juvenile Justice Act focuses on the care and protection of children, including adoption procedures for orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered children, but not surrogacy regulation. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, regulates surrogacy, not adoption.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options include mismatched pairs.


**9. With reference to Deemed to be Universities (DTBU), consider the following pairs:**

    Regulation/Provision                         Feature
1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 :  Higher educational institutions must exist for at least 20 years to apply
2. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2019 :  Institutions can start new courses with prior approval of the Executive Council
3. Section 3, UGC Act 1956                     :   Provides for the Central Government to declare institutions as DtbU
4.  NCERT's DTBU status                        :    Cannot offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956, correctly empowers the Central Government to grant Deemed to be University status.  However, the other pairs are mismatched. The 2023 UGC regulations supersede the 2019 regulations and allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DTBU status. Both the 2019 and 2023 regulations allow for new courses with prior approval.  NCERT's DTBU status allows it to offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Tribe                                    Characteristic
1.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :    Always have pre-agricultural level of technology
2.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                       :    Were labelled as "born criminals" under British rule
3.  Nomadic Tribes                               :    All are DNTs
4. Semi-Nomadic Tribes                           :  Undertake frequent seasonal movement for livelihood


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While PVTGs often have pre-agricultural levels of technology, it's not always the case; some may have transitioned to some level of agriculture.  DNTs were indeed labelled "born criminals" under British rule. Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs, making statement 3 incorrect. Semi-nomadic tribes correctly do undertake frequent seasonal movements for their livelihood. Thus only pairs 2 and 4 are completely accurate.  The other options include incorrectly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                     Key Feature

   Program/Scheme                         Target Beneficiary Group
1. Saksham Anganwadis                    :   Adolescent girls (14-18 years) in Aspirational Districts and NER
2. POSHAN Abhiyan                         :   Pregnant women, mothers, and children
3. National Nutrition Mission (NNM)       :   Children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Saksham Anganwadis specifically aims to strengthen Anganwadi centers and extend services to adolescent girls in specified regions. POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) is a comprehensive program focusing on improving nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children.

2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)         :   ICDS under MoWCD
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA):   Focuses on maternal and child health promotion
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) are primarily associated with the National Rural/Urban Health Mission, focusing on maternal and child health. Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) play a crucial role in creating awareness and counseling on various health aspects.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) are integral to the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The first pair incorrectly links AWWs to the National Rural/Urban Health Mission.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The 2023 GHI report indeed placed India at 111th position.  UNICEF's Triple Threat Report accurately focuses on the combined threats of inadequate WASH services, high child mortality linked to WASH, and climate-related hazards for children. The WHO report correctly highlights that improved WASH services could have prevented a significant percentage of deaths globally.  The provided information accurately reflects the key features and findings of each report.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                             :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                              :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                               :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all recognized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  However, the precise state/UT association is crucial for correct matching.  The Bharia and Baiga tribes are indeed present in Chhattisgarh, making statement 1 correct. Similarly, the Kamar tribe is found in Madhya Pradesh, making statement 2 correct.  However, the Baiga tribe is also present in Madhya Pradesh, and not limited to Andaman and Nicobar Islands, as indicated in option (c) and (d).  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have their own unique PVTG populations. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include or exclude one or more of the correct pairings based on an incomplete understanding of the geographical distribution of these PVTG communities.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring precise knowledge of the geographical distribution of these tribal groups across different states and Union Territories in India.


**2. With reference to PVTGs, consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion                                  Characteristic
1. Pre-agricultural technology level        :   High literacy rates
2. Economic backwardness                  :   Stagnant population
3. Declining population                    :   High level of literacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The criteria for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) include pre-agricultural technology levels, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. Option (b) correctly matches "Economic backwardness" with "Stagnant population," as economic backwardness often correlates with population stagnation.  Option (a) is incorrect because PVTGs are characterized by low, not high, literacy rates. Option (c) incorrectly combines a correct pairing with an incorrect one. Option (d) is entirely wrong because it includes the incorrect association of a declining population with high literacy rates. The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills by testing knowledge of the defining characteristics used to classify PVTGs.  The distractors utilize plausible but incorrect relationships between the criteria and characteristics, demanding careful evaluation from the candidate.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                  Focus
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Economic empowerment of DNTs
2.  SEED Scheme                                :   Rehabilitation of manual scavengers
3.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) :   Preparation of a state-wise list of DNTs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 focuses on the elimination of manual scavenging and the rehabilitation of those engaged in it. The SEED (Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities) scheme aims at the economic empowerment of Denotified Tribes (DNTs), while the National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is responsible for preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly link acts and schemes with functions that do not align with their primary goals.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of government initiatives related to social justice and the welfare of marginalized communities.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between the specific objectives of different schemes and acts aimed at addressing social issues.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                      Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs           :   4% minimum
2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions :   5% minimum
3. Recognition of disabilities                 :   10 types

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs and a minimum of 5% reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 10. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding either the percentage of reservation or the number of recognized disabilities. This question tests the candidate's factual knowledge of the key provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016, and their ability to differentiate between correct and incorrect information.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible yet incorrect, requiring a precise understanding of the Act's details.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Function/Report

2. UNHCR                                          :   State of World Population Report 2023
3. IFPRI                                           :   Global Food Policy Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) released the Global Food Policy Report 2023.  The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) releases the State of World Population Report, and the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) publishes the Global Trends: Forced Displacement report.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly assign reports to organizations that did not produce them.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations and their respective publications, requiring accurate association of reports with the issuing bodies. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to recall specific reports and their authors accurately.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                          Description
1.  5+3+3+4 Structure                           :   Four stages based on age groups: Foundational, Preparatory, Middle, and Secondary
2.  Multilingualism                              :   Proficiency in at least two languages native to India
3.  Board Examinations                          :   Students can take board exams only once per year


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for school education, replacing the older four-stage system.  It also emphasizes multilingualism, aiming for proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.  However, the NCF-SE allows students to take board exams on at least two occasions during a school year, not just once. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding either the school structure, language policy, or board examination details.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the key features of the NCF-SE and the ability to identify accurate information from incorrect statements. The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible yet incorrect, requiring a precise understanding of the NCF-SE's details.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Provision

2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 2021       :   Allows termination up to 24 weeks for specific categories
3.  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 :   Mandatory Internal Complaints Committee in organizations with 10 or more employees


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The MTP Act, 2021, allows for the termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances. The POSH Act, 2013, mandates the formation of Internal Complaints Committees in organizations with 10 or more employees.  However, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provides civil remedies for domestic violence, not criminalizing marital rape.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include or exclude the pairing related to the PWDVA, 2005, demonstrating the need for precise understanding of the legal provisions related to women's rights and protection.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various acts related to women's protection and their specific provisions.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between the scope and applicability of different laws.


**8. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Worker Category                                     Compensation/Benefit
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)                          :  Paid leave but no insurance coverage
2. Anganwadi Helper (AWH)                           :   Performance-linked incentive under ICDS-CAS
3.  Both AWWs and AWHs                              :   Covered under PMJJBY, PMSBY, and AKBY


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a performance-linked incentive under the ICDS-CAS. Both AWWs and AWHs are covered under PMJJBY, PMSBY, and AKBY insurance schemes. However, AWWs and AWHs are also entitled to paid leave.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding the compensation and benefits provided to Anganwadi workers. This question tests factual recall regarding the compensation and benefits structure for Anganwadi workers and requires careful evaluation of the options to identify the correct combination.  The distractors are designed to be plausible yet incorrect, requiring a precise understanding of the details of the compensation structure.


**1. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCRF), consider the following pairs:**

   Framework Component                         Specific Feature
1. Credit System                               :  Divides education into 8 levels (1-4: School; 4.5-8: Higher)
2. Means to Earn Credit                       :  Includes experiential learning from industries
3. Integration of Earned Credits               :  Encompasses NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF
4. Multiple Entry and Exit Options            :  Enables lifelong learning through credit transfer
5. Concept of Notional Learning Hours        :   Fixes total notional learning hours at 1200 Hours/Year for all education levels


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCRF is a comprehensive framework designed to integrate credits earned through various educational pathways.  Option (c) accurately reflects several key components of the NCRF.  The credit system, as described in the provided text, indeed divides education into eight levels, encompassing school, higher education, and vocational training.  The framework explicitly mentions earning credits through experiential learning alongside academic and vocational pursuits.  Integration of credits earned under different frameworks (NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF) is a core objective of the NCRF, ensuring seamless transition between educational stages.  The NCRF aims to facilitate lifelong learning by allowing for multiple entry and exit points within the educational system, using the credit transfer mechanism. Finally, the concept of notional learning hours, aiming for standardization, is accurately depicted in the pair.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit one or more of these crucial and accurately matched pairs, thereby failing to represent the holistic nature of the NCRF.


**2. With reference to the Accreditation of Higher Education Institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Body                                     Recommendation/Feature
1. Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee                   :   Proposed a transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited)
2. National Accreditation Council (NAC)             :   Envisioned as a meta-accrediting body under HECI
3. National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET) : Offers ‘Accreditation standard for Quality School Governance’
4. University Grants Commission (UGC)              :   Accords recognition to HEIs under the UGC Act, 1956


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee's recommendations included a shift to a binary accreditation system for higher education institutions, replacing the previous multi-point grading system.  The NAC, a key component of the HECI, is designed to function as a meta-accrediting body, overseeing and supervising the accreditation process. NABET, a constituent board of QCI, does offer an accreditation program specifically for quality school governance. Finally, the UGC's role in recognizing Higher Educational Institutions under the UGC Act, 1956, is well-established.  Therefore, option (d) is the only option that correctly captures all the accurate pairings.


**3. With reference to India's Higher Education Rankings, consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking System/Institution                         Specific Feature
1. National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) : Includes parameters like Teaching, Learning & Resources, Research & Professional Practice

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect aspects of India's higher education rankings. The NIRF uses a multi-faceted approach to evaluate institutions, incorporating parameters like teaching, learning resources, research, and professional practice.  The ARIIA ranking system was indeed integrated into the India Rankings 2023.  The Times Higher Education rankings did include a significant number of Indian universities in their 2024 edition.  Finally, CWUR uses a weighted approach considering quality of education, employability, faculty quality, and research performance. Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs.


**4. With reference to the National Medical Commission (NMC) and related Acts, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Organization                                  Specific Feature
1. NMC Act, 2019                                  :  Established the NMC as a statutory body
2. World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) : Granted recognition status to the NMC for 10 years
3. National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023 : Seeks to repeal the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947
4. National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023     :  Provides for a national exit test for dentists


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects information about the NMC and associated legislation. The NMC Act of 2019 established the NMC as a statutory body. The WFME did grant recognition to the NMC's accrediting agencies for a 10-year period. The NNMC Act of 2023 aims to replace the older Indian Nursing Council Act. The NDC Act of 2023 introduces a national exit test for dentists, similar to the NEET.  Therefore, option (d) is the only option that correctly identifies all four accurately matched pairs.


**5. With reference to the Anganwadi System in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                                      Specific Feature
1. Saksham Anganwadis                               :  Focuses on strengthening and upgrading AWCs
2. Poshan Tracker                                    :  A mobile application for tracking nutrition service delivery
3. Anganwadi Services Scheme (now Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0) : Aims to improve nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years)
4. Intensified Mission Indradhanush                    :  Focuses on reaching zero-dose children aged between 0 and 5 years



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Three of the four pairs are correctly matched. Saksham Anganwadis is a targeted initiative to improve AWCs. Poshan Tracker is a mobile application used to monitor nutrition service delivery. The Anganwadi Services Scheme aims to improve the nutritional and health status of young children. However, the Intensified Mission Indradhanush, while related to child health, is a separate immunization program and not directly a part of the Anganwadi system. Therefore, option (b) correctly identifies the three accurately paired items.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Framework                       Focus Area
1. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) : Vocational Education & Training
2. National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)           : Higher Education
3. National Curriculum Framework (NCF)/ National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF) : School Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) and the National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF) are indeed focused on school education.  The NHEQF, as its name suggests, is specifically designed for higher education.  The NSQF is geared towards vocational education and skill development. Option (a), (b) and (d) incorrectly assign focus areas to these frameworks, demonstrating a misunderstanding of their respective roles within the Indian education system.  Understanding the distinctions between these frameworks is crucial for comprehending the National Credit Framework's (NCrF) aim to integrate credits earned across different educational pathways.  The correct matching highlights the specific domain of each framework, underlining the complexity and interconnectedness of India's education system.  The question tests the candidate's ability to accurately recall and associate these key educational frameworks with their primary focus areas.  Inaccurate pairings act as effective distractors, demanding precise knowledge of the frameworks' mandates.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Key Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Reservation for PwDs in government jobs
2. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016          :  Demolishing insanitary latrines
3. National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019         :  Recognizing 21 types of disabilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Medical Commission (NMC) Act of 2019 is indeed notable for recognizing 21 types of disabilities.  The other options present incorrect pairings. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, focuses on eliminating manual scavenging, not on providing reservations for people with disabilities (PwDs).  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, addresses the rights and welfare of PwDs, including provisions for reservations, but doesn't directly mandate the demolition of insanitary latrines; that's a broader public health initiative related to sanitation.  The question tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between legislation focused on specific social issues. The incorrect pairings are carefully constructed to be plausible, demanding a precise understanding of each act's core provisions. The inclusion of distractors tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between related but distinct legal frameworks.


**3.  With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCRF), consider the following pairs:**

   Level                                  Educational Stage
1. Levels 1-4                               : Higher Education
2. Levels 4.5-8                             : Vocational Education & Training
3. Levels 1-8                               : School Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCRF divides education into eight levels.  Levels 1-4 relate to school education, levels 4.5-8 to higher education, and vocational education and training span all eight levels.  Therefore, none of the provided pairings are correct. Option 1 incorrectly assigns levels 1-4 to higher education. Option 2 wrongly associates levels 4.5-8 with vocational training. Option 3 incorrectly states that levels 1-8 encompass school education alone.  The question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the NCRF's structure. The incorrect options are designed to be plausible distractors, requiring the candidate to possess precise knowledge of the framework's level-based categorization of different educational stages. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the NCRF's structure.


**4. With reference to the  Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                        Key Feature/Objective
1. Saksham Anganwadis                     :  Focuses solely on children aged 0-6 years
2. Poshan Tracker                          : Paper-based data recording system
3. Intensified Mission Indradhanush       :  Improving nutritional status of pregnant women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Intensified Mission Indradhanush is indeed aimed at improving the nutritional status of pregnant women and children through vaccination.  The other options contain inaccuracies. Saksham Anganwadis aim to strengthen Anganwadi Centres and expand their services beyond children aged 0-6 years, including adolescent girls and early childhood care and education.  The Poshan Tracker is a mobile-based application, not a paper-based system. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific government initiatives related to child and maternal health. The incorrect options provide plausible but ultimately inaccurate details, requiring a precise understanding of each program's features and objectives.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                      : Global Hunger Index
2. IFPRI                                       : Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
3. UNHCR                                      : State of World Population Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) releases the State of World Population Report, not the Global Hunger Index. The IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) publishes the Global Food Policy Report, not the UNHCR's report on forced displacement. The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) issues the Global Trends report, not the State of World Population Report. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various international organizations and their key publications.  The incorrect options are carefully designed to be plausible distractors, requiring the candidate to have a precise understanding of each organization's area of expertise and publications.  This tests both factual recall and the ability to distinguish between closely related organizations and their work.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                          Headquarters Location
1. IFPRI                               :   Geneva, Switzerland
2. UNHCR                              :   Washington, D.C., USA
3. GANHRI                              :   Geneva, Switzerland
4. UNPFII                              :   New York, USA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is also based in Geneva, Switzerland. Finally, the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is located in New York, USA. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrect pairings of organizations and their headquarters locations.  Understanding the locations of these significant international organizations is crucial for comprehending their global impact and influence on various international issues, a frequent topic in UPSC examinations.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern correct information from plausible but incorrect alternatives.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report Title                                 Releasing Organization

2. Global Food Policy Report 2023             :   International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
3. India Ageing Report 2023                   :   UNHCR
4. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition :   UNDESA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" was released by the UNHCR, not WFP. The "Global Food Policy Report 2023" was released by IFPRI, not IIPS. The "India Ageing Report 2023" was a joint release by UNFPA and IIPS, not UNHCR alone.  Only the "Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition" was correctly matched with UNDESA as the releasing organization. This question tests knowledge of key reports released by various UN agencies and other international organizations, highlighting the importance of understanding the sources of crucial data and analysis in international development and policy.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to accurately identify the releasing organizations, a crucial skill for analyzing global reports and their implications.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Key Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Provides for a National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes
2. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Bans the employment of children below the age of 14 in all employment
3. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016 :   Recognizes 21 types of disabilities
4. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021             :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, focuses on banning manual scavenging and providing rehabilitation, not establishing a national commission for DNTs.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, deals with disability rights, not child labor. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016 prohibits child labor, not recognizes types of disabilities. Only the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, correctly matches with the feature of allowing only altruistic surrogacy. This question tests the understanding of various social welfare legislations in India and their key provisions.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options tests the candidate's ability to accurately recall the specifics of each Act and avoid common misconceptions. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the nuances of Indian legislation.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                           Ministry/Organization
1.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme :   Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD)
2.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0       :   Ministry of Labour and Employment
3.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)          :   Ministry of Jal Shakti
4.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not MoWCD.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 are under MoWCD, not the Ministry of Labour and Employment.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) is not under the Ministry of Jal Shakti; it's under the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Only the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan is correctly paired with the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various government schemes and their respective administrative ministries, testing factual recall and understanding of the organizational structure of Indian governance.  The distractors test the candidate's ability to accurately associate schemes with the correct ministries.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                   Key Parameter/Focus
1. Global Gender Gap Index                     :   Measures access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene
2. Gender Social Norms Index                   :   Focuses on women's empowerment and gender equality
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)             :   Tracks economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, political empowerment
4. Path to Equal Report                          :   Comprises four indicator categories: reproductive, maternal, and newborn and child health; infectious diseases; non-communicable diseases; service capacity and access


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index focuses on economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment, not WASH parameters. The Gender Social Norms Index assesses societal norms related to gender equality.  The UHC Service Coverage Index tracks health service coverage, not economic participation. Only the Path to Equal Report correctly matches with its focus on women's empowerment and gender parity.  This question tests the understanding of various indices related to gender equality and health and their specific parameters.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding indices and their scopes.  The question assesses factual recall and precise understanding of index definitions.




**1. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

    Year          GHI Score for India       Ranking of India
1. 2015          29.2                     100
2. 2023          28.7                     111
3. 2023          27.0                     111
4. 2015          28.7                     110

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 GHI report placed India at 111th position with a score of 28.7.  Option 2 correctly reflects this data. The 2015 GHI report assigned India a score of 29.2,  as indicated in option 1.  Option 3 is incorrect because while the 2023 report showed a score of 28.7 for India, a score of 27.0 was the highest score for South Asia and not India's rank. Option 4 incorrectly states India's rank in 2015; the precise ranking isn't provided in the source. The question tests factual recall of GHI scores and rankings for India across different years. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect distractors (options 3 and 4) increases the question's difficulty.


**2. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

    Level       Education Type
1. 1-4          Higher Education
2. 4.5-8        School Education
3. 1-8          Vocational Education & Training

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF integrates credits from school, higher education, and vocational training. Levels 1-4 correspond to school education, while levels 4.5-8 represent higher education.  Vocational education and training encompass levels 1-8.  This is accurately depicted in option 3. Options 1 and 2 reverse the correct level assignments for school and higher education, acting as effective distractors.  Option 3 demonstrates a solid understanding of the NCrF's structure and integration of different education types.


**3. With reference to the Anganwadi System, consider the following pairs:**

    Worker Type           Key Role
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW) :   Focuses primarily on maternal and child health immunization

(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While AWWs and ANMs both contribute to maternal and child health, the primary focus of AWWs is on early childhood care and development. ANMs concentrate more on maternal and child health services, including immunizations. ASHAs play a crucial role in creating awareness about various health factors and providing counseling. Option (b) correctly identifies ASHA's key role. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly assign roles to AWWs and ANMs, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuanced differences in responsibilities within the Anganwadi system.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR's mandate centers on protecting refugees and supporting asylum seekers. The World Food Programme (WFP) focuses on combating hunger and providing food assistance worldwide.  UNFPA works to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights.  Only option (b) correctly matches UNHCR with its core mandate. The other options incorrectly pair organizations with their mandates, effectively testing the candidate's knowledge of the roles and functions of various international organizations involved in social development.


**5. With reference to Scheduled Tribes (ST) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    State             Highest Number of PVTGs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PEMSR prohibits employing people as manual scavengers without protective gear and mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines.  Constructing insanitary latrines is explicitly an offence.  Failing to demolish insanitary latrines is also a violation.  Therefore, none of the given pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the examinee's understanding of the specific provisions of the PEMSR Act, focusing on what constitutes an offence and what does not. The options are designed to be plausible distractors, requiring a thorough understanding of the Act's content.

All four pairs accurately reflect the data provided in the NFHS-5 report, making option (c) the correct answer.  This question tests the candidate's ability to remember and recall precise data from the NFHS-5 report. This is a difficult question, as it requires accurate recall of multiple data points.


**8. With reference to the  Ayushman Bharat Yojana, consider the following pairs:**

    Component                      Focus Area
1. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission :  Primary healthcare interventions

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, allows only altruistic surrogacy, not commercial surrogacy. The MTP Act, 1971,  as amended, allows abortion up to 20 weeks for all women, and in certain circumstances beyond 20 weeks. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, explicitly prohibits discrimination against transgender individuals in employment, education, and healthcare. Only option (b) correctly identifies a key feature of the Transgender Persons Act.  The other options contain inaccuracies regarding the other acts, testing the candidate's knowledge of the detailed provisions of these important legislations.


**10. With reference to the  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Area                     Target/Goal
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)      :   At least 50% by 2035 in higher education
2. Multiple Exit Options             :   Restricting students to a single exit point after completing the entire course

It also promotes multiple exit options within undergraduate programs, allowing students to exit at different points and earn various qualifications. The policy emphasizes multidisciplinary education, encouraging students to engage with multiple fields of study.  Only option (a) correctly identifies the GER target. Options 2 and 3 present contradictory statements to the policy's objectives. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the key goals and strategies of NEP 2020 in higher education.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options increases the question's difficulty.


**1. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   NEP 2020 Provision                                     Specific Detail
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target                  :   100% in preschool to secondary level by 2030
2.  Higher Education GER target                         :   50% by 2035

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims for 100% GER in preschool to secondary level by 2030 and a 50% GER in higher education by 2035.  These are explicitly stated goals within the policy. PARAKH is indeed the name of the national assessment centre established as per NEP 2020 recommendations.  The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a key feature designed to digitally store academic credits earned across various institutions, enhancing flexibility and mobility in education.  Option (d) accurately reflects these correctly matched pairs. Option (3) is incorrect as the structure of schooling proposed by NEP 2020 is 5+3+3+4, not 10+2+3. The other options are incorrect because they omit at least one of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

   PGI Aspect                                          Specific Detail
1.  Highest Grade Attained in PGI 2.0                  :   Daksh

(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 2, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PGI uses data from UDISE+ 2021-22, making pair 2 correct.  PGI-D assesses performance at the district level, making pair 5 correct. However, in PGI 2.0, no state/UT attained the highest grade (Daksh), making pair 1 incorrect. The lowest grade was Akanshi-3, not Akanshi-1 (pair 3 is incorrect). While the PGI for States/UTs was initially released for 2017-18 and subsequently for 2021-22, it does not necessarily mean it's released annually, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.



**3.  With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbU) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   DtbU Aspect                                        Specific Detail

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Education is responsible for granting DtbU status, making pair 1 correct.  The UGC Act 1956, Section 3 provides the legal basis for this, making pair 2 correct.  However, the 2023 regulations allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply, making pair 3 incorrect.  The University of Delhi is not among the recently granted DtbU status, making pair 4 incorrect. The regulations governing DtbUs are the 2023 regulations, not the 2019 ones, making pair 5 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.

(a) 1, 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF's primary goal is to integrate credits from different educational pathways, making statement 1 correct. The NHEQF is one of the frameworks integrated, making statement 3 correct. The NEP 2020 guided the NCrF's development, making statement 4 correct. However, the NCrF integrates three qualification frameworks (NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF), not two, making statement 5 incorrect. The Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, played a key role in the NCrF's development, making statement 2 incorrect. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., USA, not Geneva, Switzerland. UNHCR's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not Washington, D.C., USA. GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York, USA.  The incorrect headquarters locations in the options serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of these important international organizations.  Understanding the locations of these organizations is crucial for comprehending their operational reach and global influence.  The question effectively tests factual recall and differentiates between similar-sounding organizations.

The PWDVA, 2005, defines domestic violence comprehensively, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, does *not* mandate sex reassignment surgery for legal recognition; it allows self-identification of gender. The incorrect features in the options serve as strong distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuances of these crucial pieces of legislation. A thorough understanding of these acts is essential for analyzing social justice issues in India. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of legal frameworks related to vulnerable groups.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a digital platform designed to store academic credits earned from various institutions, allowing for greater flexibility in higher education.  Pair 2 is incorrect; the NRF aims to *catalyze and expand* research and innovation, not reduce it. Pair 3 is incorrect because the NCrF integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education, not solely higher education.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect statements regarding the NRF and NCrF makes this a challenging question, testing detailed knowledge of NEP 2020 and its components. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the policy's implementation.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                         Key Organization Involved

2. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) : World Health Organization (WHO)
3. Global Gender Gap Index                           :  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is jointly released by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. The incorrect organizations in the options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of different international development indices and their publishers.  This question evaluates factual recall and understanding of the sources of key development indicators.


**5. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State                                          Number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
1. Odisha                                        :  13
2. Madhya Pradesh                               :  7
3. Chhattisgarh                                  :  11

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India (13).  The numbers of PVTGs in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are different from those stated in the options.  The incorrect figures for Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are designed as plausible distractors.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of vulnerable tribal groups within India, demanding precise factual recall.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

  Act/Legislation                                    Key Provision
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Legalizes manual scavenging under certain conditions.
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :  Sets the age of majority at 16 years for all purposes.
3.  Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 : Defines the age of a child as 18 years.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The POCSO Act, 2012, defines a child as a person below 18 years of age. Pair 1 is incorrect; the Act *prohibits* manual scavenging, not legalizes it under specific conditions. Pair 2 is incorrect; the JJ Act sets the age of majority at 18 years, with exceptions for heinous crimes involving 16-18 year olds. The incorrect provisions in the options act as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the legal framework protecting vulnerable groups. This question tests factual recall and understanding of child protection laws.


**7. With reference to organizations working on social issues, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                      Mandate/Focus Area
1.  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) :  Protection of the rights of transgender persons
2.  National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) :  Welfare of Scheduled Castes
3.  National Commission for Women (NCW)            :  Empowerment of women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The NCSC focuses on the welfare of Scheduled Castes, and the NCW works towards the empowerment of women.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the NCPCR's mandate is the protection of child rights, not transgender rights.  The inclusion of a plausible but incorrect statement regarding NCPCR's mandate makes the question more challenging. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the mandates of different national commissions.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

  Program/Initiative                                    Ministry/Department
1.  Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)       : Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  Poshan Abhiyan                                    : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
3.  National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR)    : Ministry of Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) is under the aegis of the Ministry of Education. Pair 1 is incorrect; PMKVY falls under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. Pair 2 is incorrect; Poshan Abhiyan is primarily driven by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, though other ministries are involved.  The incorrect ministries in the options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the organizational structure of government programs. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the governmental structure related to social programs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                     Ministry
1. Anganwadi Services Scheme                 :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2. National Rural Health Mission             :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
3. Intensified Mission Indradhanush         :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
4. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0      :   Ministry of Women and Child Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Anganwadi Services Scheme (now renamed as Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0) falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), focusing on the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  The National Rural Health Mission is a flagship program of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, aiming to improve the health indicators at the rural level.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush is a health initiative under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, focused on improving full immunization coverage among children and pregnant women.  Therefore, only the pairing of Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 with the Ministry of Women and Child Development is accurate. The other pairings incorrectly attribute these schemes to different ministries.  Understanding the roles and responsibilities of different ministries is crucial for comprehending government schemes and their effective implementation.  This question tests the candidate's ability to recall and accurately match government schemes with their respective ministries.  The distractors are designed to test whether the candidate has a thorough understanding of the ministries involved and not just a superficial knowledge.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                 Primary Goal

3. National Health Policy 2017             :   Achieve Universal Health Coverage
4. POSHAN Abhiyan                         :   Reduce stunting in high malnutrition burden districts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on providing health insurance and expanding access to healthcare services across various levels. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission aims to integrate health records and improve access to healthcare through technology. The National Health Policy 2017 sets the broader goal of achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by improving healthcare services. POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) primarily aims at reducing malnutrition and stunting among children in high-burden districts. Thus, only the pairings of National Health Policy 2017 with achieving Universal Health Coverage and POSHAN Abhiyan with its focus on reducing stunting are correctly matched. The other options incorrectly pair initiatives with goals not directly related to their primary objectives. This question tests the examinee's knowledge of various health initiatives and their primary goals.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate’s understanding of the nuances of each initiative.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" focuses on the global patterns of forced migration due to various factors. The "Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)" report analyzes the health impacts of inadequate WASH services. The "Triple Threat Report" examines the combined threats of limited access to WASH services, high mortality due to unsafe WASH, and climate risks for children. The "Global Food Policy Report 2023" analyzes global food insecurity and the factors causing price surges.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The other pairs incorrectly link reports with different key focuses. This question assesses the examinee's understanding of various reports and their specific subjects. The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's depth of knowledge.

3. Gender Social Norms Index                   :   United Nations Development Programme
4. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)             :   World Health Organization and World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum. The Gender Social Norms Index is published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) is jointly released by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The other pairs incorrectly link indices with their publishers or organizations. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of different global indices and their sources. The incorrect options are plausible distractors, ensuring the question is challenging and not easily guessable.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                 Key Provision/Feature

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provides civil remedies for domestic violence but does not explicitly criminalize marital rape. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (amended 2021), allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks under certain circumstances. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, prohibits commercial surrogacy and allows only altruistic surrogacy.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, bans the practice of manual scavenging.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include pairs that misrepresent the key features of the respective Acts/Policies.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of social welfare legislation and their key provisions. The incorrect options provide plausible distractors, making it a challenging question.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) is responsible for protecting and promoting the rights of children in India. The National Medical Commission (NMC) is the regulatory body for medical education and practice in India. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) is the nodal body for inter-country and intra-country adoptions in India. Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly associate organizations with functions they do not perform. The distractors are designed to test the candidate’s detailed knowledge of these bodies.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the roles and responsibilities of various organizations.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age and regulates the employment of adolescents in hazardous occupations. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a child as a person below 18 years. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, regulates surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy, not commercial surrogacy. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, defines domestic violence comprehensively, including physical, sexual, emotional, and economic abuse.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The other pairs incorrectly link Acts with features not directly related to them, testing the candidate's precise understanding of the legislation.  This question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of various acts related to child welfare and women's protection.


**8. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                      Specific Provision/Implementation

The NEP 2020 promotes multidisciplinary education through the establishment of MERUs. It aims to increase the GER to at least 50% by 2035. The ABC facilitates lifelong learning by allowing students to accumulate and transfer credits across institutions. The NRF is established to boost research and innovation in the country.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  The options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge about the key features of the NEP 2020 and their specific implementations.  This question tests the candidate's comprehensive understanding of the NEP 2020 and its key features.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes it a challenging question for those with only a superficial understanding.


**9. With reference to the  various Acts related to Tribal welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                 Key Provision/Feature
1. The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 :  Focuses on rehabilitation of manual scavengers
2.  The Forest Rights Act, 2006                 :   Grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Aims to prevent atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
4.  The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 :  Empowers Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, primarily aims to prevent atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, grants forest rights, including habitat rights, to forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers, including PVTGs. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, focuses on eliminating manual scavenging and rehabilitating those involved. The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, empowers Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas in decision-making processes related to development and planning.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other pairs incorrectly associate acts with different provisions.  This question tests the candidate's in-depth understanding of legislation related to tribal welfare.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's knowledge and understanding of the specific provisions of each Act.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Initiative                 Associated Body/Act
1.  National Credit Framework (NCrF)       :   National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET)
2.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)          :    University Grants Commission (UGC) Regulations, 2023
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)     :    Ministry of Education
4.  Higher Education Commission of India (HECI):  National Accreditation Council (NAC)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is a collaborative effort involving multiple bodies, including the National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET), to integrate credits from various educational pathways. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is directly related to the UGC Regulations, 2023, which mandate its use for storing academic credits digitally. The National Research Foundation (NRF) falls under the Ministry of Education's purview. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) encompasses the National Accreditation Council (NAC), which is responsible for the accreditation of higher educational institutions.  All four pairs accurately reflect the relationship between the higher education initiative and the associated body or act. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Key Feature
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021       :   Allows commercial surrogacy
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :   Allows termination up to 24 weeks for all women
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Allows employment of manual scavengers with protective gear
4.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:   Mandates 5% reservation in all government jobs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. The MTP Act, 1971, in its amended form, allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women, with certain extensions under specific circumstances. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, prohibits the employment of manual scavengers, except in cases where appropriate protective gear and equipment are used. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%. Thus, only the third pair is correctly matched, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatches in the other pairs.


**3. With reference to the Indian education system, consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Framework/Program             Characteristic
1.  National Curriculum Framework (NCF)-SE, 2023 :  Based on a 10+2 structure
2.  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020       :  Advocates for a 5+3+3+4 structure
3.  Performance Grading Index (PGI)            :  Assesses performance at the national level only
4.  National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR):  Primarily focuses on higher education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), 2023, is based on the 5+3+3+4 structure proposed by NEP 2020, not the older 10+2 structure. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 indeed advocates for a 5+3+3+4 structure for school education. The Performance Grading Index (PGI) assesses the performance of school education systems at both state and district levels. The National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) aims to improve learning outcomes across all levels of education, not just higher education. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Primary Mandate

2.  UNHCR                                          :  Protecting refugees and asylum seekers
3.  IFPRI                                           :  Research on food security and poverty reduction
4.  World Food Programme (WFP)                   :  Providing humanitarian aid in conflict zones

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) focuses on sexual and reproductive health, not combating hunger. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is dedicated to protecting refugees and asylum seekers. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) conducts research on food security and poverty reduction. The World Food Programme (WFP) provides food assistance in emergencies and humanitarian crises.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**5. With reference to vulnerable sections of society in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Vulnerable Group                      Specific Government Scheme/Act
1.  Scheduled Tribes (STs)                :  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)
2.  De-notified Tribes (DNTs)              :   Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
3.  Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)      :  Anganwadi Services Scheme (Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0)
4.  Manual Scavengers                     :  National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) does not directly address Scheduled Tribes.  The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is specifically designed for De-notified Tribes. While Anganwadi Services Scheme helps many, it's not exclusively for PwDs. The National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) aims to eliminate manual scavenging. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include at least one mismatched pair.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Report/Index                     Releasing Body
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI)                  :   Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)
2.  India Ageing Report 2023                  :   United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
3.  Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report:  International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
4.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress Report 2023: World Health Organization (WHO)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not MoSPI. The India Ageing Report 2023 was indeed released by UNFPA in collaboration with IIPS. The Global Trends report on forced displacement was released by UNHCR, not IIPS.  The SDGs NIF Progress Report 2023 was released by MoSPI, not WHO.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislation                                  Subject Matter
1.  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956:  Regulates surrogacy
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:  Governs child adoption
3.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021       :  Protects rights of children in conflict with law
4.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:  Defines benchmark disability

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

HAMA deals with adoption within the Hindu community, not surrogacy.  The Juvenile Justice Act does indeed govern child adoption. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, regulates surrogacy, not children in conflict with the law. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, defines benchmark disability.  Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one mismatched pair.


**8. With reference to the Indian government's initiatives for social welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                                 Target Beneficiary Group
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                      :  Persons with Disabilities
2.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush             :  Children aged 0-5 years and pregnant women
3.  Poshan Abhiyaan                             :  De-notified Tribes
4.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED):  Malnourished children and pregnant women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a health insurance scheme, not specifically for PwDs. Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on improving immunization coverage among children and pregnant women. Poshan Abhiyaan is a nutrition improvement program, not exclusively for DNTs. SEED targets De-notified Tribes. Only pair 2 accurately matches the scheme with its target beneficiary group. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Commission                           Report/Recommendation
1.  Idate Commission                           :  Caste census
2.  Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee             :  Reforms in higher education accreditation
3.  UN Dhebar Commission (1961)               :  Identification of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
4.  Mandal Commission (Second Backward Classes Commission), 1980:  Establishment of National Research Foundation (NRF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Idate Commission focused on De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes, not a caste census. Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee indeed recommended reforms in the higher education accreditation system. The UN Dhebar Commission was instrumental in identifying PVTGs. The Mandal Commission dealt with the classification of OBCs, not the NRF.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to at least one mismatched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                              :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                               :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                                :   Andaman & Nicobar Islands
4.  Hakki Pikki Tribe                         :   Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  Bharia and Baiga are found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, highlighting the complexities of tribal distribution across state boundaries.  The Kamar tribe is predominantly found in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group primarily located in Karnataka. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (b) is partially correct but omits the Hakki Pikki tribe. Option (d) is incorrect because the Baiga tribe is not found in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the geographical distribution of PVTGs in India.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as incorrectly assigning a tribe to a state, makes the question challenging.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Category                                  Number
1. Total Number of PVTGs in India           :   70
2. Number of States/UTs with PVTGs        :   17
3. Number of PVTGs in Odisha               :   15

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual recall about PVTGs in India.  All three pairs provided contain incorrect information.  There are 75 PVTGs spread across 18 states and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, not the numbers stated in pairs 1 and 2.  Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, not 15 as stated in pair 3.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect figures for each pair makes the question difficult and requires precise knowledge of the data.  The correct option is (d) because none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Area                                       Provision
1. Reservation in Government jobs          :   Not less than 6%
2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions:  Not less than 4%
3. Recognized types of disabilities          :   18

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Act mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs, not 6%. Pair 2 is correct; the Act specifies not less than 5% reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 18.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. The near-correct figures in the incorrect pairs act as effective distractors.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                    Ministry
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs   : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) : Ministry of Rural Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge of various government acts and schemes related to social welfare and the ministries responsible for them. Pair 1 is correctly matched; the mentioned Act falls under the purview of the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. Pair 2 is incorrect; the Dr. Ambedkar scholarship scheme is administered by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. Pair 3 is also incorrect; the SEED scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The inclusion of plausible distractors related to social welfare schemes makes the question challenging.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Area                                      Target/Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education by 2035 : 40%
2. Duration of Undergraduate Degrees       :  3 or 4 years with multiple exit options
3.  Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) : To improve vocational training

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests understanding of the NEP 2020. Pair 1 is incorrect; the NEP aims for a GER of at least 50% by 2035, not 40%. Pair 2 is correct; the policy introduces 3 or 4-year undergraduate degrees with multiple exit options. Pair 3 is incorrect; MERUs are intended to promote multidisciplinary education and research, not primarily vocational training.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The incorrect options include plausible but inaccurate figures and descriptions, making the question challenging.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Headquarters
1.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) : Rome, Italy
2.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Geneva, Switzerland
3.  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : Washington, D.C.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge of the headquarters of various international organizations. Pair 1 is incorrect; IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Rome. Pair 2 is correct; UNHCR's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland. Pair 3 is incorrect; GANHRI's headquarters are also in Geneva, Switzerland. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The incorrect options utilize plausible but false headquarters locations, making the question challenging.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                  Releasing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index                      :  United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index                    : World Economic Forum
3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) : WHO and World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of various indices and reports and the organizations that release them.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. Pair 2 is incorrect; the Gender Social Norms Index is released by the UNDP, not the World Economic Forum. Pair 3 is correct; the UHC SCI is jointly released by WHO and the World Bank. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The incorrect options use plausible but incorrect releasing organizations, increasing the difficulty level.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                     Key Finding Related to India
1.  India Ageing Report 2023                  :  India's population is set to surpass China's by mid-2023.
2.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023 : India's GHI score shows significant improvement.
3. Global Food Policy Report 2023             : India's food insecurity has risen during 2020-2022.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the ability to link reports with their key findings related to India. Pair 1 is correctly matched; the India Ageing Report 2023 highlights India's population surpassing China's. Pair 2 is incorrect; while the SDG report discusses global progress, it doesn't specifically focus on a significant improvement in India's GHI score. Pair 3 is correctly matched; the Global Food Policy Report 2023 notes a rise in food insecurity in India during the specified period. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The incorrect pairing of the SDG report with a specific India-centric finding acts as a strong distractor.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/UT where found
1. Bharia                                     :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
2. Kamar                                      :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga                                      :   Odisha
4. Hakki Pikki                               :   Chhattisgarh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Madhya Pradesh, not in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  The Kamar tribe is indeed found in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making statement 2 partially correct.  The Baiga tribe is primarily associated with Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, not Odisha. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group primarily residing in Karnataka. Therefore, only the pairs mentioning Kamar in Madhya Pradesh and Hakki Pikki in Karnataka are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of tribal distribution across Indian states, demanding precise knowledge of geographical locations.  The incorrect options include plausible distractors, playing on the fact that some tribes are present in multiple states and using similar-sounding names to confuse.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs          :    Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology     :     High literacy rates
2. Low level of literacy                   :     Advanced agricultural practices
3. Economic backwardness                :     High per capita income
4. Declining or stagnant population        :     Rapid population growth

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the given pairs are incorrectly matched.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs are precisely the opposite of what is described in the options. PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. This question assesses conceptual understanding of PVTG identification criteria and requires the candidate to evaluate each pair against the established definition, highlighting the inverse relationship presented in the options to create difficult distractors.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                               :     Ministry/Department
1.  SEED Scheme                             :    Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT): Ministry of Rural Development
4.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0      :  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 is correctly linked to the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is also under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This question tests factual recall of government schemes and their respective administrative ministries, requiring precise knowledge of organizational structures.  The incorrect options use plausible distractors, including ministries with related mandates to increase difficulty.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                :    Percentage/Number
1. Minimum reservation in Government jobs :   5%
2. Minimum reservation in Government/Government aided higher educational institutions : 4%
3. Number of types of disabilities recognized: 21

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The minimum reservation for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in government jobs is 4%, not 5%, while the reservation in higher educational institutions is 5%, not 4%. The number of disabilities recognized under the Act is correctly stated as 21. This question assesses factual recall of specific provisions within the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, demanding precise knowledge of numerical data related to reservations and the categorization of disabilities. The incorrect options utilize similar percentage figures to create challenging distractors.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                             :      Headquarters
1. UNFPA                                   :     Geneva, Switzerland
2. UNDESA                                  :     Washington, D.C., USA
3. GANHRI                                  :     New York, USA
4. UNPFII                                  :     Rome, Italy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The headquarters of UNFPA is in New York, USA, not Geneva, Switzerland. UNDESA's headquarters are in New York, USA, not Washington, D.C., USA. GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York, USA.  UNPFII's headquarters are in New York, USA, not Rome, Italy. This question tests factual recall of the headquarters locations of various international organizations, demanding precise knowledge of geographical locations.  The incorrect options utilize plausible distractors, including cities that host major UN agencies to increase difficulty.


**6. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Aim/Feature                              :      Target/Value
1. Target Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education by 2035 : 100%
2.  Number of languages students should be proficient in          :  Two
3. Minimum duration of Undergraduate degrees     :    3 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The target GER in higher education by 2035 is 50%, not 100%.  NEP 2020 recommends proficiency in at least three languages, not two. The minimum duration of undergraduate degrees is correctly stated as 3 years.  This question assesses factual recall of specific targets and features within the NEP 2020, demanding precise knowledge of numerical data and policy details. The incorrect options use plausible but incorrect figures to create challenging distractors.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Index                               :       Releasing Organization
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                   :    World Bank
2. Global Gender Gap Index                     :    United Nations Development Programme
3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) : World Health Organization and World Bank
4. Path to Equal Report                        :    Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank. The Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is correctly attributed to the WHO and World Bank. The Path to Equal Report is jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP, not Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. This question tests factual recall of reports and their releasing organizations, demanding precise knowledge of authorship. The incorrect options utilize plausible distractors, including organizations with related mandates to increase difficulty.


**8. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Worker Category                       :    Ministry/Department
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)               :    Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)         :    National Rural/Urban Health Mission
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA):    ICDS under MoWCD

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) are under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme, which falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) are correctly linked to the National Rural/Urban Health Mission. Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) are also not under ICDS under MoWCD. This question tests factual recall of worker categories within the healthcare and social welfare systems and their respective administrative structures, demanding precise knowledge of organizational affiliations. The incorrect options include plausible distractors, playing on the interlinkages between related programs to increase difficulty.



**1. With reference to the legal framework for sexual harassment at the workplace in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                      Description
1.  Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)       :   Mandatory in organizations with fewer than 10 employees
2.  Time limit for filing a complaint           :   Can be extended by the ICC beyond three months
3.  Conciliation process                       :   Allows monetary settlements to resolve disputes
4.  Appeal process                             :  Can be filed in court within 90 days of the ICC's decision
5. Action against false complaints             :  Mandatory dismissal of the complainant

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) is mandatory for organizations with 10 or more employees, making statement 1 incorrect.  The POSH Act allows for the extension of the three-month time limit for filing complaints by the ICC, making statement 2 correct. The conciliation process explicitly prohibits monetary settlements, rendering statement 3 incorrect.  An appeal can be filed in court within 90 days of the ICC's decision, making statement 4 correct. The act allows for recommendations for action against false complaints but doesn't mandate dismissal, making statement 5 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the legal provisions related to sexual harassment at the workplace. The distractors are designed to test the examinee's precise understanding of the nuances of the law.


**2. With reference to child labour in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                   Key Feature
1.  ILO Convention 182                       :   Defines child labour as work harmful to physical and mental development
2.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016 :   Permits employment of children below 14 years in specific industries
3.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme :   Primarily focuses on punishing employers of child labour
4.  PENCiL Portal                               :   Managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

ILO Convention 182 focuses on the worst forms of child labour and doesn't provide a comprehensive definition as mentioned in statement 1. The 2016 amendment prohibits employment of children below 14, contrary to statement 2. The NCLP scheme focuses on rehabilitation and education, not punishment, as stated in 3. The PENCiL portal is managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development, making statement 4 incorrect. Only statement 1 accurately reflects the focus of ILO Convention 182 on the harmful nature of child labour.  The question tests factual recall regarding legislation and schemes related to child labour. The distractors utilize closely related but incorrect details to assess the examinee's precise knowledge.


**3. With reference to the adoption process in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Legislation/Body                                 Function/Jurisdiction
1.  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956 :   Governs inter-country adoption of Indian children
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :   Exclusively applies to Hindu adoptions
3.  Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA)      :   Manages only intra-country adoptions
4.  Specialized Adoption Agency (SAA)             :   Not recognized under the JJ Act, 2015

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

HAMA, 1956, does not govern inter-country adoptions; that is covered by the JJ Act, 2015.  The JJ Act, 2015, is not exclusively for Hindu adoptions; it applies to all children needing care and protection. CARA manages both intra- and inter-country adoptions. SAAs are recognized under the JJ Act, 2015 for placing children in adoption. Therefore, only statement 4 is correct, highlighting the fact that SAAs are integral to the adoption process under the JJ Act, 2015.  This question tests the understanding of the legal framework governing adoption in India. The distractors utilize common misconceptions about the applicability and jurisdiction of different laws and bodies involved in the adoption process.


**4. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                                    Specific Detail
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target           :   100% by 2035 for higher education
2.  Multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees:   Only available for vocational streams
3.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                 :   Stores academic credits earned from various institutions
4.  National Research Foundation (NRF)            :   Primarily focuses on school education research

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 targets a 50% GER for higher education by 2035, not 100%, making statement 1 partially correct.  Multiple exit options are available for both academic and vocational streams, making statement 2 incorrect. The ABC indeed stores credits from various institutions, making statement 3 correct. The NRF focuses on higher education and research, not school education, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched, albeit with a slight modification to statement 1. This question tests the understanding of the key features of NEP 2020. The distractors are designed to test the examinee's precise knowledge of the policy's provisions and targets.



**5. With reference to the  "State of Food and Agriculture 2024" report, consider the following pairs:**

   Report Finding                                 Detail

2.  Surge in food prices in 2021-22             :   Caused mainly by increased domestic consumption
3.  Impact of climate change on food security  :   Projected to worsen food insecurity by 2050
4.  Organization releasing the report           :   World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The rise in food insecurity was due to multiple crises, including the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, not just improved technology. The surge in food prices was due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical factors, not domestic consumption.  Climate change is indeed projected to worsen food insecurity, and the report was released by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not the World Bank. Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge about the "State of Food and Agriculture 2024" report and its key findings.  The distractors offer plausible but incorrect explanations for the trends observed in the report.


**6. With reference to the Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 report, consider the following pairs:**

   Report Finding                                 Detail
1.  Number of forcibly displaced people        :   Decreased compared to 2021
2.  Proportion of displaced children             :   Less than 25%
3.  Refugee hosting countries                   :   Mostly high-income countries
4.  Number of stateless people                 :   Increased compared to 2021
5.  Return of displaced people to their homes :   Significant decrease compared to previous year

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The number of forcibly displaced people increased in 2022 compared to 2021. The proportion of displaced children was over 30%. Low- and middle-income countries host the majority of refugees. The number of stateless people did increase. The return of displaced people showed a significant increase. Therefore, only statement 4 accurately reflects a finding from the report. The question tests factual recall of data presented in the UNHCR's report. The distractors provide incorrect or opposite information to challenge the examinee's knowledge of the specifics.


**7. With reference to the  various organizations mentioned in the provided text, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Headquarters Location
1.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Rome, Italy
2.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) :   Geneva, Switzerland
3.  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) :   New York, USA
4.  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)     :   Geneva, Switzerland

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

IFPRI's headquarters is in Washington, D.C., not Rome. UNHCR's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland. GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, not New York. UNPFII's headquarters are in New York, not Geneva.  Therefore, only the location of UNHCR headquarters is correctly matched. This question assesses the examinee's knowledge of the locations of various international organizations. The distractors employ plausible but incorrect locations to test the precision of the examinee's understanding.


**8. With reference to the  various Acts and schemes related to tribal welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                 Key Feature
1.  PM JANMAN                                :   Focuses solely on providing housing to PVTG households
2.  Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission:   Launched before the Union Budget 2023-24
3.  Panchsheel Principles for Tribal Development:   Emphasizes the imposition of alien values on tribal communities
4.  Forest Rights Act, 2006                    :   Does not grant habitat rights to PVTGs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PM JANMAN has a broader scope than just housing.  The Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission was announced in the Union Budget 2023-24. The Panchsheel Principles emphasize respecting tribal traditions and avoiding the imposition of alien values. The Forest Rights Act does grant habitat rights to PVTGs. Therefore, only statement 4 is incorrect, making (d) the correct answer. This question tests the understanding of government initiatives and policies related to tribal welfare.  The distractors include statements that are partially true or opposite to the facts to challenge the examinee's detailed knowledge.

(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index annually.  The Gender Social Norms Index is published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI) is a joint initiative of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank. The Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) are indeed jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP as part of their "Path to Equal" report.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly attribute indices to the wrong organizations.  Option (d) correctly identifies the joint authorship of WEI and GGPI by UN Women and UNDP.  Understanding the mandates and publications of these international organizations is crucial for UPSC preparation, as such organizations frequently feature in current events and policy discussions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Report                                    Key Finding

(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The India Ageing Report 2023, released by UNFPA and IIPS, indeed highlights India's projected population surpassing China's. The "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" by UNHCR correctly states that 76% of the world's refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries, not high-income countries as stated in option 2. The SDG Progress Report 2023 accurately reflects the weak progress and setbacks in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The Global Food Policy Report 2023 from IFPRI correctly points to the rise in food insecurity due to various crises. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Understanding global reports on population, displacement, sustainable development, and food security is essential for UPSC preparation, demonstrating awareness of global challenges and their impact on India.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a key provision or focus of the respective Act or policy. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA) 2005 provides a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing various forms of abuse. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021,  legislatively restricts surrogacy to altruistic forms. The amended Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, extends the permissible timeframe for abortion under specific circumstances. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to eradicate manual scavenging and provide rehabilitation support to those affected.  A strong understanding of these laws and their implications is essential for UPSC preparation, especially in the context of social justice and women's rights.

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly link the schemes/programmes with their target groups. The NCLP (National Child Labour Project) focuses on the rehabilitation of child labourers. POSHAN Abhiyan aims to improve nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children. Saksham Anganwadis seeks to strengthen and upgrade Anganwadi Centres. The SEED (Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities) specifically targets De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes. This question tests knowledge of various government initiatives aimed at protecting and empowering vulnerable groups, a recurring theme in UPSC examinations.  Understanding the objectives and target beneficiaries of these schemes is crucial for demonstrating policy awareness.


**7. With reference to  Indices and Reports on Social Development, consider the following pairs:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA, not Geneva, Switzerland.  The UNHCR's headquarters are indeed in Geneva, Switzerland. GANHRI is also correctly paired with Geneva, Switzerland as its headquarters. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is correctly located in New York, USA. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington D.C. Option (b) is incorrect because IFPRI is incorrectly paired. Option (d) is incorrect for the same reason. The question tests factual recall of the headquarters locations of prominent international organizations.  Understanding the locations helps in grasping the global reach and influence of these bodies and their potential interactions with different nations and regions.


**2. With reference to reports on global issues, consider the following pairs:**

Report Title                                       Releasing Organization

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’ was released by the UNHCR, not the WFP. The WFP focuses on food security and assistance, while displacement is UNHCR's domain. The ‘Global Food Policy Report 2023’ is correctly attributed to IFPRI, reflecting its expertise in food policy research. The SDG Progress Report 2023 is correctly linked to UNDESA, which plays a central role in monitoring and reporting on the SDGs.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misattribute the releasing organizations for at least one of the reports.  This question tests knowledge of key reports related to global development and the organizations responsible for their production. It demonstrates an understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different UN agencies and research institutions.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024,  introduced a key change allowing surrogacy with donor gametes under specific conditions (at least one gamete from the intending couple). The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, permits pregnancy termination up to 20 weeks for all women based on one doctor's recommendation.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, effectively prohibits manual scavenging and outlines provisions for the rehabilitation of those involved in the practice.  All three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair. This question assesses factual recall concerning significant legislation impacting social issues in India.  Knowledge of these acts demonstrates an understanding of legal frameworks related to reproductive rights, women's health, and social justice.

The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate credits earned across different educational pathways (school, higher education, vocational training), promoting flexibility and mobility. The Performance Grading Index (PGI) is designed to evaluate the performance of the school education system at both state and district levels. The National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, indeed establishes a foundation to provide strategic guidance for research and innovation in various scientific and technological fields.  All three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they do not include all the correctly matched pairs. This question tests knowledge about recent reforms and initiatives in the Indian education system.  Understanding these programs demonstrates an awareness of policy efforts to improve quality, access, and integration within the education sector.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is indeed focused on sexual and reproductive health and rights. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) plays a crucial role in supporting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) specifically monitors the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  All three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they fail to include all the correctly matched pairs. This question assesses understanding of the mandates and functions of key United Nations organizations.  Knowledge of these organizations and their work demonstrates an understanding of the international framework for addressing global development challenges.


**6. With reference to government initiatives related to social welfare, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                  Key Objective/Feature
1. Saksham Anganwadis                      :  Strengthening and upgrading Anganwadi Centres.
2.  National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) :  Reducing stunting and improving nutrition for women and children.
3. Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II : Achieving ODF Plus status in villages.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Saksham Anganwadis is a program aimed at strengthening and upgrading Anganwadi Centres to improve the delivery of services. The National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) focuses on reducing stunting and improving the nutritional status of women and children. Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II aims to achieve ODF Plus status in villages, indicating sustained ODF status along with solid and liquid waste management.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.  This question tests factual knowledge of government schemes focused on social welfare and public health.  Understanding these initiatives demonstrates an awareness of policy efforts to address key development challenges in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Provision/Feature
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (as amended in 2021) : Permits abortion up to 24 weeks for all women
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Bans employment of manual scavengers
4.  Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 :  Provides for self-perception of gender identity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly legalizes only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy.  The MTP Act, 1971, as amended in 2021, significantly broadened access to abortion, extending the permissible timeframe.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to eradicate the practice of manual scavenging.  Finally, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, allows individuals to self-identify their gender.  All pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                                    Implementing Ministry/Agency
1.  Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) :   Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP)             :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  Poshan Abhiyan                                   :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
4.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0               :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM JANMAN, a comprehensive initiative for tribal welfare, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  The National Child Labour Project is implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Poshan Abhiyan, the National Nutrition Mission, is a multi-ministerial initiative, but its primary implementation rests with the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, focusing on Anganwadi services and nutrition, is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to mismatched ministries/agencies.


**3. With reference to vulnerable sections, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                        Specific Focus/Provision
1.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :  Defines a child as a person below 16 years of age
2.  Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 :  Sets the age of consent at 16 years
3.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016       :  Mandates 5% reservation in government jobs for PwDs
4.  National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem : Aims to eliminate manual scavenging completely

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, defines a child as a person below 18 years of age, not 16.  The POCSO Act sets the age of consent at 18, not 16.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, correctly mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs, not 5%. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate manual scavenging. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Key Report/Initiative
1.  UNFPA                                          :   Global Hunger Index
2.  IFPRI                                           :   State of World Population Report
3.  World Health Organization (WHO)                 :   Global Food Policy Report
4.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)    :   Tracking Universal Health Coverage Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA releases the State of World Population Report, not the Global Hunger Index.  IFPRI publishes the Global Food Policy Report, not the State of World Population Report. The WHO, in collaboration with the World Bank, releases the Tracking Universal Health Coverage Report. The UNDP contributes to various reports related to development, including the Gender Social Norms Index, but not the Tracking Universal Health Coverage Report specifically. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to education policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Act                                       Key Feature/Objective
1.  National Credit Framework (NCrF)               :  Divides education into 6 levels
2.  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020            : Aims for 50% GER in higher education by 2035
3.  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) :  Introduces a 5+3+3+4 schooling structure
4.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023 :  Establishes a meta-accrediting body for higher education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Credit Framework (NCrF) divides education into 8 levels, not 6. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, does not establish a meta-accrediting body; that function is associated with the National Accreditation Council (NAC) envisioned under NEP 2020.  The NEP 2020 correctly aims for at least 50% GER in higher education by 2035, and the NCF-SE correctly introduces a 5+3+3+4 schooling structure.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State with Highest Number of PVTGs
1. Baiga                                     :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Kamar                                     :   Chhattisgarh
3. Bharia                                    :   Odisha
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Odisha houses the highest number (13) of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India.  While the Baiga and Bharia tribes are indeed listed as PVTGs, Madhya Pradesh has a significant population of Baiga, and Chhattisgarh has a significant population of Kamar. The Bharia tribe is predominantly found in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, not Odisha. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern accurate information from potentially misleading options.  The inclusion of Odisha as a distractor in pair 3 highlights the need for precise knowledge about the geographical distribution of PVTGs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                  Ministry
1. PM JANMAN                                :   Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
2.  SEED Scheme                              :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric Scholarship     :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan) is a multi-ministry initiative, but it falls primarily under the purview of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs due to its focus on Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is indeed run by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls is also a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question tests the understanding of the governmental structure and the allocation of responsibilities to different ministries for welfare schemes. The inclusion of PM JANMAN as a distractor in pair 1 highlights the need to understand the multi-faceted nature of government initiatives.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Key Provision/Feature
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Allows for monetary settlements during conciliation
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016  :  4% reservation in police forces
3.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :  Permits commercial surrogacy
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly prohibits monetary settlements during conciliation; it focuses on rehabilitation and preventing the practice. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates reservations for PwDs in government jobs, but this is explicitly excluded for police forces. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, strictly prohibits commercial surrogacy, only allowing altruistic surrogacy.  The question assesses the understanding of key legislative provisions and the ability to identify inaccuracies.  The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the acts.  This question tests factual recall and analytical skills.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Category                                  Highest Ranked Institution (India) in 2024
1.  Overall (Times Higher Education)          :  Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras
2.  Overall (CWUR Global 2000)              :  Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore
3.  Overall (QS World University Ranking)    :  Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

In the 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, IIT Madras topped the list of Indian Universities.  However, the CWUR Global 2000 report and QS World University Rankings use different methodologies and criteria, resulting in different top-ranked Indian institutions.  IISc Bangalore and IIT Bombay may have featured highly in those rankings, but they were not necessarily the highest-ranked Indian universities in those specific years. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the nuances of different university ranking systems.  The inclusion of IISc Bangalore and IIT Bombay as distractors emphasizes the need for precise knowledge of specific ranking results.


**5. With reference to tribal welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                                      Characteristic
1.  PVTGs                                         :  Always pre-agricultural level of technology
2.  DNTs                                          :  Originally designated as “born criminal”
3.  Scheduled Tribes (STs)                           :  Constitute 94.8% of Lakshadweep's population


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While PVTGs often exhibit pre-agricultural technology, it's not universally true; some may have adopted rudimentary agricultural practices.  The Denotified Tribes (DNTs) were indeed labeled as "born criminals" during the British Raj.  Lakshadweep has the highest percentage of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the characteristics of different tribal groups in India and their historical context.  The distractors highlight the need for nuanced understanding of the definitions and classifications of these groups.  The question tests factual recall, conceptual understanding, and analytical skills.


**6. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                              Implementation Detail
1.  Multiple Exit Options                      :  Notional learning hours fixed at 1200 Hours/Year
2.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)            :  Credit transfer mechanism to enable lifelong learning
3.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target       :  At least 50% by 2025


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees are a key feature of NEP 2020, and the concept of notional learning hours (1200 hours/year) is directly related to the credit system that facilitates this flexibility.  The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is designed to digitally store credits earned from various institutions, thereby enabling lifelong learning through seamless credit transfer.  The NEP 2020 aims for at least 50% GER by 2035, not 2025. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The question tests the understanding of the NEP 2020's key provisions and their implementation details.  The inclusion of an incorrect timeframe for the GER target serves as a plausible distractor.


**7. With reference to women's issues in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Key Feature
1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005  :  Criminalizes marital rape
2.  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013:  Mandatory Internal Complaints Committee for organizations with 5 or more employees
3.  Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023 : Prioritizes equitable access to menstrual hygiene resources

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, provides civil remedies for domestic violence but doesn't criminalize marital rape. The POSH Act, 2013, mandates an Internal Complaints Committee for organizations with 10 or more employees, not 5. The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, focuses on equitable access to menstrual hygiene resources.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of legislation and policies related to women's issues. The incorrect options are designed to test detailed understanding of the acts, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge.


**8. With reference to child welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                   Key Provision
1.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :  Defines a child as a person below 16 years of age.
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme :  Focuses solely on rescuing children from hazardous occupations.
3.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 : Prohibits employment of children below 18 years in all employments.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, defines a child as a person below 18 years of age. The NCLP scheme addresses rehabilitation and education of child laborers, not only rescue from hazardous work. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all employments and adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the nuances of child welfare legislation and schemes.  The incorrect options are designed to test detailed knowledge and avoid superficial understanding.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                      State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                     :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                       :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                       :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all recognized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  However, the question plays on the fact that some PVTGs are spread across multiple states.  The Bharia and Baiga tribes are indeed present in Chhattisgarh, making statement 1 partially correct.  The Kamar tribe is found in Madhya Pradesh, making statement 2 partially correct.  However, the Baiga tribe is *not* located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; that is incorrect. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a distractor highlights the geographical spread of PVTGs, testing the candidate's knowledge beyond simple memorization. The question successfully differentiates between partial and complete correctness of the pairs, demanding a nuanced understanding.



**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs       Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology :   Use of advanced irrigation techniques
2. Low level of literacy                  :   High school graduation rates
3. Economic backwardness              :   High per capita income

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology (meaning reliance on traditional methods, not advanced ones), low literacy rates (the opposite of high graduation rates), and economic backwardness (low per capita income). The options are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the specific criteria and to avoid simple guessing, forcing a thorough understanding of the concept. The use of contrasting descriptions makes the question more challenging and assesses the candidate's ability to identify inaccuracies in statements related to PVTG identification.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nomadic Community Category      Example Tribe
1. Hunter/trappers of birds and animals: Hakki Pikki
2. Pastoral communities             :   Konda Reddis
3. Peripatetic groups of peddlers     :   Gujjars

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Hakki Pikki tribe is categorized as a semi-nomadic group, not primarily hunters/trappers. The Konda Reddis are indeed an example of hunter-gatherer communities, making statement 2 correct.  Gujjars are a pastoral community, but are also included in the peripatetic category, representing those who move from place to place engaging in various occupations. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The inclusion of Hakki Pikki as a distractor tests the candidate's knowledge of specific tribes and their categorization within nomadic communities. This question demands precise knowledge of specific tribal examples and their associated nomadic categories, making it a challenging question.



**4. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Commission                   Provision/Finding
1. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871      :   Granted DNTs full citizenship rights
2. Renke Commission, 2008         :   Estimated 15 crore Indians belong to DNTs
3. Idate Commission Report          :   Recommended a temporary commission for DNTs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, did *not* grant DNTs full citizenship rights; rather, it criminalized them. The Renke Commission did indeed estimate that approximately 15 crore Indians belong to DNTs or nomadic communities, making statement 2 correct.  The Idate Commission recommended a *permanent*, not temporary, commission for DNTs. Thus, only statement 2 is correctly matched. The question effectively tests the candidate's understanding of the historical context of DNTs and the recommendations of various commissions, requiring detailed knowledge of the subject matter.  The inclusion of partially correct and incorrect statements necessitates a careful evaluation of each pair.




**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                   Ministry
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013  :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme     :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)  :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Therefore, only statement 1 is correctly matched.  The incorrect options act as effective distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of the specific ministries responsible for various welfare schemes. The question demands precise knowledge of the administrative structure of welfare schemes in India, testing factual recall and understanding of governmental organization.



**6. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                   Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs            :   Not less than 2% reservation
2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions:   Not less than 5% reservation
3. Recognition of types of disabilities       :   15 types of disabilities recognized

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Act mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs, not 2%. The Act mandates not less than 5% reservation in higher educational institutions, making statement 2 correct.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 15. Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched. This question tests the precise details of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, focusing on numerical data and specific provisions.  The close proximity of incorrect numerical values in the distractors adds to the difficulty level.




**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Report/Initiative
1.  World Health Organization (WHO)          :   Global Hunger Index (GHI)
2.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI):   Global Food Policy Report
3.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)   :   Triple Threat Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not WHO.  IFPRI does indeed publish the Global Food Policy Report, making statement 2 correct.  The Triple Threat Report is published by UNICEF, not UNFPA. Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's ability to associate organizations with their respective publications and initiatives.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect associations increases the difficulty and assesses conceptual understanding of the roles of different international organizations.



**8. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Component                                      Detail
1. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)                     :   Paid a fixed monthly salary by State Governments only
2. Poshan Tracker                               :   A web-based application for tracking nutrition
3. Saksham Anganwadis                           :   Focuses solely on children aged 0-6 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

AWWs receive a fixed monthly honorarium, but this is decided by the Centre and supplemented by State Governments, not solely by the latter.  Poshan Tracker is a mobile-based application, not a web-based one. Saksham Anganwadis also extend their focus to adolescent girls and early childhood care and education, not limiting it to children aged 0-6 years.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  This question requires detailed knowledge of the Anganwadi system's operational aspects and digital components, creating a high-difficulty level. The distractors use nearly correct but ultimately inaccurate details, enhancing the challenge.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                           State/UT
1. Bharia                         :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar                          :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga                           :   Andaman & Nicobar Islands
4.  PVTGs                          :   18 States and 1 UT
5. Highest number of PVTGs     :   Madhya Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because the statement that there are 75 PVTGs spread over 18 states and 1 Union Territory (Andaman and Nicobar Islands) is accurate.  The other pairs are incorrectly matched. While Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga are indeed PVTGs, their distribution across states is not accurately reflected in options 1, 2, and 3.  Bharia and Baiga are found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and Kamar is also present in both states.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect. Madhya Pradesh does not house the highest number of PVTGs; Odisha does (13).


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

    Criterion for identifying PVTGs         Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology   :   High level of literacy
2. Low level of literacy                 :    High level of economic development
3. Economic backwardness              :   Growing population
4. Declining or stagnant population   :   Use of advanced farming techniques
5.  Technological advancement         :   High standard of living

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are the opposite of what's presented in the options.  PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  The descriptions provided in the options 1-5 are the antonyms of the actual characteristics. Therefore, all the pairs are incorrectly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe/Community                  Characteristic
1. Hakki Pikki Tribe                 :   Hunter/Trapper community
2. Konda Reddis                     :   Semi-nomadic tribe from Karnataka
3. Pardis                            :   Pastoral community
4. De-notified Tribes (DNTs)         :  All nomadic tribes are DNTs
5.  Vimukta Jatis Day                :   Celebrated on August 9th


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Pardis are indeed a pastoral community.  The Hakki Pikki Tribe is a semi-nomadic group, but not from Karnataka; they are from Karnataka. Konda Reddis are a hunter-gatherer community, not a semi-nomadic tribe from Karnataka. Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; all DNTs are nomadic tribes.  Vimukta Jatis Day is celebrated on August 31st, not August 9th (which is International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples).


**4. With reference to the De-notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

    Government initiative             Objective
1. National Commission for DNTs    :   To provide free competitive exam coaching.
2. Dr. Ambedkar Scholarship       :   To prepare a state-wise list of DNT castes.
3. Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme          :   To provide health insurance to families.
4. SEED Scheme                      :   Construction of hostels for DNT boys and girls.
5. Development and Welfare Board :   To improve educational empowerment of DNTs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Dr. Ambedkar Scholarship aims to improve the educational empowerment of DNTs, and the Development and Welfare Board was constituted to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.  The other options misrepresent the objectives of the initiatives.  The National Commission for DNTs prepares a state-wise list of DNT castes, not provide coaching. The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme focuses on hostel construction, not health insurance, and the SEED scheme offers competitive exam coaching and health insurance, not just hostel construction.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                           Key Feature
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013  :   Allows for the employment of manual scavengers with protective gear.
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016            :   Mandates 5% reservation in police forces for PwDs.
3.  National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem     :   Promotes 100% mechanization of sanitation, including sewer cleaning.
4.  Swachhta Udyami Yojana              :   Provides concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment.
5.  National Education Policy 2020                     :   Sets up a new National Assessment Centre, PARAKH.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Options 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem indeed promotes 100% mechanization of sanitation, and Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment. Option 1 is incorrect because the act prohibits the employment of manual scavengers, except under specific conditions with protective gear. Option 2 is incorrect because the RPwD Act does not mandate reservations in police forces.  Option 5 is correct as NEP 2020 established PARAKH.  Therefore, only options 3 and 4 are fully accurate.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                             :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                              :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                               :   Andaman & Nicobar Islands
4. Hakki Pikki Tribe                         :   Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Option 1, 2, and 3 are therefore incorrect because they incorrectly assign these tribes to only one state. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic tribal group from Karnataka, making option 4 correct. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have several indigenous tribes, but the Baiga tribe is not primarily located there.  The question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups in India, highlighting the complexities of tribal demographics and the need for precise knowledge in this area.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as assigning tribes to incorrect states or UTs, increases the difficulty level, making simple guessing less effective.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Feature
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Provides for paid menstrual leave
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016  :   Bans the employment of children below 14 years
3.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021             :   Recognizes 21 types of disabilities
4.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016 :  Allows only altruistic surrogacy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, focuses on eliminating manual scavenging and rehabilitating those involved. It does not address menstrual leave. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, deals with the rights and protections of persons with disabilities, including recognition of various types of disabilities, but does not ban child labour.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, regulates surrogacy practices, primarily allowing altruistic surrogacy. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The question assesses the understanding of various acts and policies related to social justice and welfare, requiring the candidate to accurately link the legislation with its specific provisions. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's in-depth knowledge of the subject.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Report/Initiative
1.  UNFPA                                      :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2.  IFPRI                                       :   Global Food Policy Report 2023
3.  UNHCR                                     :   India Ageing Report 2023
4.  World Health Organization (WHO)             :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1,2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) focuses on population issues, including aging populations, but the India Ageing Report 2023 was released in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) released the Global Food Policy Report 2023. The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) released the ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report.’ The WHO does not release the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report; this report is released by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA). Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations and their areas of expertise, requiring recall of specific reports and initiatives.  The distractors are carefully chosen to challenge the candidate's understanding of the mandates and activities of these organizations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry                                    Scheme/Policy
1.  Ministry of Tribal Affairs                   :   National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes
2.  Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment :   Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023
3.  Ministry of Women and Child Development  :   National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system
4.  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare      :   National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is responsible for policies and schemes related to tribal welfare, including the establishment and functioning of the National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes. The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment handles issues related to marginalized communities, including the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is involved in schemes concerning women and children, but the National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system is primarily under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for health-related policies and initiatives, including the National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's awareness of the roles and responsibilities of various ministries in the Indian government and their relation to specific social welfare schemes and policies.  The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, requiring accurate knowledge to identify the correct matches.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Body                                 Function/Responsibility
1.  Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS)          :   Administering elections to Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
2.  Election Commission of India                  :   Determining policy interest rate
3.  Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)              :   Overseeing and supervising an independent ecosystem of accrediting institutions
4.  National Accreditation Council (NAC)         :   Investigating and monitoring matters relating to constitutional safeguards for backward classes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) is responsible for national security matters, not administering elections. The Election Commission of India administers elections to various bodies including the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is responsible for determining the policy interest rate to achieve the inflation target. The National Accreditation Council (NAC) is responsible for overseeing and supervising an independent ecosystem of accrediting institutions in higher education. The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) investigates and monitors matters relating to constitutional safeguards for backward classes. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various constitutional and statutory bodies in India and their functions.  The distractors are designed to assess the candidate's understanding of the specific roles and responsibilities of these bodies.


**6. With reference to Tribal welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                    Description
1.  PTGs (Primitive Tribal Groups)           :   Currently, there are 75 PVTGs spread over 18 states
2.  PVTGs (Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups) :   First recognized in 1973 based on recommendations of the UN Dhebar Commission
3.  ODF Plus Model village                   :   Houses the highest number of PVTGs in India
4.  Odisha                                  :   Has the highest population of STs in absolute numbers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PTGs were renamed PVTGs in 2006, not 1973.  The statement about the number of PVTGs and states is correct. Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs, not the highest population of STs. Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of STs in absolute numbers.  The definition of an ODF Plus Model village is not directly related to the number of PVTGs in a state.  Therefore, only the statement regarding the renaming of PTGs to PVTGs and the description of PVTGs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of terminology and facts related to tribal welfare in India, necessitating accurate recall of definitions and statistics.  The distractors are strategically placed to assess the depth of the candidate's knowledge and understanding of the topic.


**7. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                     Feature
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)                :   Aims to reach at least 50% by 2035
2.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)               :   Divides education into 8 levels
3.  National Credit Framework (NCrF)           :   Digitally stores academic credits
4.  5+3+3+4 design of schooling                :   Proposed a binary accreditation system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims to increase the GER in higher education to at least 50% by 2035.  The ABC is a digital platform designed to store academic credits earned by students from various institutions. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education.  The 5+3+3+4 design of schooling is a structural reform, but the binary accreditation system was a recommendation from a later committee, not directly a feature of the NEP itself. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  The question assesses the understanding of key concepts and features of the NEP 2020 and requires the recall of specific details and their correct association. The distractors are designed to test the precision and accuracy of the candidate's knowledge.


**8. With reference to Social Justice and Empowerment initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                    Ministry
1.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs  :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system          :   Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
4.  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) : Ministry of Labour and Employment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1,2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs is also under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system is a joint initiative of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) is under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of government schemes and their respective administrative ministries, requiring precise understanding of the allocation of responsibilities within the government structure.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's recall and understanding of specific governmental schemes.


**1. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, consider the following pairs:**

   Act Provision                                      Specific Detail
1. POSH Act, 2013: Definition of Sexual Harassment : Includes unwelcome physical contact, demands for sexual favors, sexually colored remarks, and showing pornography.
2. POSH Act, 2013: Definition of Workplace          :  Only includes physical spaces where the employee works.
3. POSH Act, 2013: Internal Complaints Committee (ICC):  Mandatory in organizations with fewer than 10 employees.
4. POSH Act, 2013:  Aggrieved Woman                :  Excludes clients, customers, and domestic workers.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The POSH Act, 2013, defines sexual harassment comprehensively to include various forms of unwelcome physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature. This encompasses physical contact or advances, demands or requests for sexual favors, sexually colored remarks, showing pornography, and other similar acts.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The definition of "workplace" in the POSH Act is broader than just the physical space where an employee works. It includes any place visited by an employee during the course of employment, including transportation provided by the employer.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) is mandatory in organizations with 10 or more employees, not fewer than 10.  Organizations with less than 10 employees have a different complaint mechanism.

Pair 4 is incorrect. The definition of "aggrieved woman" under the POSH Act includes clients, customers, and domestic workers who may experience sexual harassment in the context of their interactions with the organization or individual.


**2. With reference to Child Labour in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                  Key Feature
1. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 : Permits employment of children below 14 years in hazardous occupations.
2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme  :  Operates under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
3. PENCiL Portal                                  : Managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment.
4. Bachpan Bachao Andolan                      : A government initiative to rehabilitate child laborers.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all employments and also prohibits the employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme operates under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

Pair 3 is correctly matched. The PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal is indeed managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment.

Pair 4 is incorrect. Bachpan Bachao Andolan is a non-governmental organization (NGO), not a government initiative.  While it works to rescue and rehabilitate child laborers, it is not a government program.


**3. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following pairs:**

   Act Provision                                   Specific Detail
1. JJ Act, 2015: Definition of Child                 :  A person who has completed 18 years of age.
2. JJ Act, 2015 (as amended):  Adoption Order Issuance:  Solely issued by a civil court.
3. JJ Act, 2015 (as amended): Categories of Offences:  Divides offences into only heinous and petty offences.
4. JJ Act, 2015 (as amended): Appeals on Adoption Orders:  No appeal is allowed for any order made by a Child Welfare Committee.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The JJ Act defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age.

Pair 2 is incorrect.  The JJ Amendment Act, 2021, allows District Magistrates (including Additional DMs) to issue adoption orders, not solely civil courts.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The JJ Act, as amended, categorizes offences into heinous, serious, and petty offences, not just heinous and petty.

Pair 4 is incorrect. The JJ Amendment Act, 2021, allows appeals against adoption orders issued by DMs to the Divisional Commissioner.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Act Provision                                     Specific Detail
1. RPwD Act, 2016: Reservation in Government Jobs:  Includes a 4% reservation in all government jobs.
2. RPwD Act, 2016: Reservation in Higher Education:  Includes less than 5% reservation in all higher educational institutions.
3. RPwD Act, 2016: Definition of Benchmark Disability:  A person with less than 40% of a specified disability.
4. RPwD Act, 2016:  Free Education                 :  Mandates free education for children with benchmark disabilities between ages 16 and 18.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched. The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates not less than 4% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs.

Pair 2 is correctly matched.  The Act mandates not less than 5% reservation for persons with disabilities in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The RPwD Act defines a "person with benchmark disability" as someone with not less than 40% of a specified disability.  The question incorrectly states "less than 40%."

Pair 4 is incorrect. The Act mandates free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18, not 16 and 18.


**5. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, consider the following pairs:**

   Act Provision                                     Specific Detail
1. PEMSR Act, 2013: Definition of Manual Scavenger: Excludes individuals using protective gear while handling human waste.
2. PEMSR Act, 2013: Punishment for Violations      :  A maximum fine of Rs. Fifty Thousand.
3. PEMSR Act, 2013:  Responsibility for Identification:  Solely rests with the central government.
4. PEMSR Act, 2013:  Rehabilitation Measures       :  Does not include financial assistance.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched. The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle human waste manually without appropriate protective gear.  Those using such gear are excluded.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Act prescribes a maximum punishment of imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both. The question significantly understates the fine amount.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The responsibility for identifying manual scavengers rests with local authorities (municipalities, panchayats, cantonment boards, and railway authorities), not solely the central government.

Pair 4 is incorrect. The Act does include provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, including financial assistance, training for alternative employment, and help with property acquisition.


**6. With reference to  Menstrual Hygiene in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Initiative                                    Specific Feature
1. Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023:  Focuses solely on providing free sanitary napkins.
2. Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023:  Prioritizes only urban populations.
3. Spain’s Menstrual Leave Policy                    :  Grants paid menstrual leave to all workers.
4.  Global Menstrual Hygiene Initiatives             :  Have universally eliminated stigma surrounding menstruation.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are incorrectly matched.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, has a broader focus than just providing free sanitary napkins. It aims to ensure a stigma-free experience and equitable access to menstrual hygiene resources for all who menstruate.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The policy prioritizes underserved and vulnerable populations, including those in rural areas.

Pair 3 is incorrect. While Spain has granted paid menstrual leave to workers, it's not universal across all countries or even all European countries.

Pair 4 is incorrect.  While progress is being made globally, stigma surrounding menstruation persists in many parts of the world.  Universal elimination is not yet a reality.


**7. With reference to Surrogacy in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                   Specific Provision
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:  Allows surrogacy only for married couples.
2. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021               :  Permits commercial surrogacy.
3. Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021:  Does not regulate surrogacy.
4.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2022             :  Limits the number of surrogacy attempts per surrogate mother to 3.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. While the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, have specific provisions, they do not explicitly restrict surrogacy solely to married couples.  Single women under certain conditions can now utilize surrogacy.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy and allows only altruistic surrogacy.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, does regulate surrogacy, making it a key part of the overall framework for ART services in India.

Pair 4 is correctly matched.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2022, do limit the number of surrogacy attempts per surrogate mother to a maximum of three.


**8.  With reference to Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Initiative                                      Specific Detail
1.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)     :  First recognized in 2006.
2.  PM JANMAN                                        :  Has an outlay of ₹10,000 crore for 3 years.
3.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                         :  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
4.  Sixth Schedule of the Constitution                :  Includes provisions for autonomous administrative divisions within states.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. PVTGs were first recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).

Pair 2 is incorrect.  PM JANMAN has an estimated outlay of ₹24,104 crore for three years, significantly higher than the figure in the question.

Pair 3 is incorrect. While all DNTs are nomadic tribes, not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  There's a distinction between the two.

Pair 4 is correctly matched. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution does indeed make provisions for the formation of autonomous district councils (ADCs) and autonomous regional councils (ARCs) in certain states.


**9. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy/Initiative                                Specific Feature
1. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020             : Aims for a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 25% by 2035.
2.  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023:  Allows only institutions older than 20 years to apply for Deemed to be University status.
3. National Credit Framework (NCrF)                 :  Does not integrate credits earned through vocational education and training.
4.  Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024: Included less than 50 Indian Universities.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50%, not 25%, by 2035.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The UGC regulations of 2023 allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for Deemed to be University status, unlike the 2019 regulations.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The NCrF explicitly seeks to integrate credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education.

Pair 4 is correctly matched. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 included around 91 Indian universities.  The option in the question incorrectly states "less than 50".



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/Union Territory
1. Bharia PVTG                            :   Odisha
2. Kamar PVTG                             :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                              :   Chhattisgarh
4.  Konda Reddis                           :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  The Kamar and Baiga tribes are indeed PVTGs found in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.  However, the Konda Reddis are a hunter-gatherer tribe primarily located in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, not the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Therefore, only pair 3 (Baiga PVTG : Chhattisgarh) and pair 4 (Konda Reddis :  Andhra Pradesh and Odisha) are correctly matched, although the latter is partially correct as Konda Reddis are also found in Odisha.  Option (c) accurately reflects this.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched states/union territories for the Bharia and Konda Reddi tribes, respectively.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs        Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology   :   High level of literacy
2. Low level of literacy                   :   Advanced economic status
3. Declining or stagnant population       :   High birth rates


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  Pair 1 incorrectly states that PVTGs have high literacy, Pair 2 incorrectly states that PVTGs have advanced economic status, and Pair 3 incorrectly suggests high birth rates instead of declining or stagnant populations. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct option.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nomadic/Semi-Nomadic Tribe          Characteristic
1. Hakki Pikki Tribe                     :   Hunter-gatherer community
2. Pardis                               :   Peripatetic group of peddlers
3. Chenchus                              :   Pastoral community


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group known for their traditional occupations, not primarily hunter-gatherers. The Pardis are indeed a peripatetic group often associated with trading and other itinerant activities.  The Chenchus are primarily hunter-gatherer communities, not pastoralists. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include mismatched characteristics for at least one tribe.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Category of Disability                    Provision
1. Intellectual Disability                 :   Exemption from reservation in police forces
2. Acid Attack Victims                     :   Right to free education (6-18 years)
3.  Benchmark Disability (≥40% disability):  Mandatory 5% reservation in higher education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, includes intellectual disability as a recognized disability and mandates reservation in government jobs and higher education institutions, but with an exception for police forces. Acid attack victims are also recognized under the Act and are entitled to free education between the ages of 6 and 18. The definition of "benchmark disability" aligns with the provision of a minimum 40% specified disability threshold for eligibility for reservation.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. Option (a) is incorrect because of the incorrect statement about police force reservation, and option (d) is incorrect due to the inclusion of the incorrect statement about the police force reservation.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative for DNTs      Description
1. Dr. Ambedkar Scholarship            :   Hostel construction for DNT children
2. Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme             :   Economic empowerment through coaching
3. Scheme for Economic Empowerment (SEED):   Pre-matric and post-matric scholarships


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Dr. Ambedkar Scholarship scheme indeed provides pre-matric and post-matric scholarships for Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs). The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme focuses on constructing hostels for DNT boys and girls. The SEED scheme aims at economic empowerment through competitive exam coaching, health insurance, etc.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Stage of Schooling                     Feature
1. Foundational Stage (Ages 3-8)        :   Introduction of vocational education
2. Preparatory Stage (Ages 8-11)        :   Emphasis on multilingualism
3. Secondary Stage (Ages 14-18)       :   Interdisciplinary areas of study


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE emphasizes foundational literacy and numeracy in the Foundational Stage (ages 3-8), not vocational education.  Multilingualism is a key feature across all stages but is particularly emphasized in the Preparatory Stage (ages 8-11). Interdisciplinary areas of study are introduced at the Secondary Stage (ages 14-18). Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Key Report/Publication
1. UNFPA                                        :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2. UNHCR                                        :   India Ageing Report 2023
3. IFPRI                                         :   Global Food Policy Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) releases the State of World Population report, not the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022" report. That report is published by UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). The India Ageing Report 2023 is also not a UNFPA publication; it is a collaborative effort often involving the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) and other organizations.  IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) does indeed publish the Global Food Policy Report.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.


**8. With reference to the National Medical Commission (NMC), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of NMC                                    Detail
1.  Legal Basis                                      :   The Dentists Act, 1948
2.  International Recognition                       :   World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) accreditation
3.  Primary Function                                :   Overseeing paramedical education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NMC's legal basis is the NMC Act, 2019, not the Dentists Act, 1948 (which is covered by the NDC Act, 2023). The NMC does receive international recognition through WFME accreditation.  However, the primary function of the NMC is overseeing medical education and practice, not paramedical education (that falls under the purview of other bodies).  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization                                    Mandate/Function
1. GANHRI                                        :   Accrediting National Human Rights Institutions
2. UNPFII                                         :   Monitoring implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child
3. UNCRC                                         :   Advising on indigenous issues related to development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

GANHRI (Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions) is indeed responsible for accrediting National Human Rights Institutions.  The UNPFII (UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues) focuses on indigenous issues, not on children's rights. The UNCRC (UN Committee on the Rights of the Child) monitors the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, not indigenous issues. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched, making (a) the correct answer.


**10. With reference to the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin), consider the following pairs:**

    Status                                       Characteristic
1.  ODF                                          :   Every household using safe sanitation technology
2.  ODF Plus                                     :   Sustained ODF status with solid waste management
3. ODF Plus Model Village                       :   Visual cleanliness and IEC messages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect the characteristics of ODF, ODF Plus, and ODF Plus Model Village under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin). ODF signifies the absence of open defecation and the use of safe sanitation in every household. ODF Plus builds upon this by adding solid waste management. The ODF Plus Model Village goes further, incorporating visual cleanliness and information, education, and communication (IEC) messages.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.



**1. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, consider the following pairs:**

   **Provision**                                      **Detail**
1.  Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) Composition : Minimum of three members, half of whom must be women.
2.  Time Limit for Filing Complaint                 :  Within six months from the date of the incident.
3.  Action against False Complaints                  :  Mandatory dismissal of the complainant.
4.  Conciliation Process                             :  Monetary settlements are permitted.
5.  Appeal Process                                   : Appeal to a higher court within 60 days.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **ICC Composition:** The POSH Act mandates a minimum of four members in an ICC, at least half of whom must be women.  The statement incorrectly reduces the minimum number to three.

2. **Time Limit for Filing Complaint:** The act specifies a time limit of three months, which can be extended by the ICC.  The statement incorrectly states it as six months.

3. **Action against False Complaints:** The Act states that the ICC *may* recommend action against a complainant who has made a false complaint, in accordance with service rules. It does not mandate dismissal. This shows a critical difference between "may" and "must" in legal language.

4. **Conciliation Process:** The POSH Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a basis for conciliation.  The statement is incorrect.

5. **Appeal Process:** The Act allows for an appeal within 90 days, not 60 days, to a court.


The question tests factual recall and understanding of legal nuances within the POSH Act. The distractors are designed to be plausible based on potential misinterpretations or a lack of precise knowledge of the Act's provisions.  The correct answer highlights the importance of accurate understanding of legal language and the specific details of the legislation.


**2. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following pairs:**

   **Provision**                                          **Detail**
1.  Definition of a Child                               :  A person who has not completed 16 years of age.
2.  Trial of Heinous Offenses Committed by Juveniles  :  Mandatory trial as an adult in a designated court.
3.  Adoption Order Appeals                             :  Appeals are permitted to the High Court.
4.  Categories of Offenses                              :  Defined as heinous, serious, and petty, based solely on the severity of the punishment.
5.  Designated Court for Offenses                      :  All offenses are tried exclusively in designated Juvenile Justice Boards.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, has undergone amendments, and the provided statements reflect inaccuracies. Let's break down why each pair is incorrect:

1. **Definition of a Child:** The act defines a child as a person below 18 years of age.  The statement uses the incorrect age of 16.

2. **Trial of Heinous Offenses:** The act allows for the possibility of trying a juvenile aged 16-18 as an adult for heinous offenses, but it's not mandatory.  The statement presents it as a mandatory procedure.

3. **Adoption Order Appeals:** The 2015 Act and subsequent amendments introduced changes to the appeals process for adoption orders.  The statement's claim about appeals to the High Court is an oversimplification and may not be universally accurate depending on the specific amendment and state-level implementation.

4. **Categories of Offenses:** While the act categorizes offenses, the criteria go beyond just the severity of punishment. The classification considers various other factors.

5. **Designated Court:**  The act specifies different courts or bodies for different types of cases, not an exclusive Juvenile Justice Board for all offenses.


This question tests factual knowledge of the Juvenile Justice Act, its amendments, and the subtleties of its implementation.  The distractors aim to trap candidates who lack detailed knowledge or who may recall outdated information. The correct answer underscores the need for precise understanding of the legal framework.


**3. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   **Definition**                                      **Detail**
1.  Domestic Violence                               :  Includes only physical and sexual abuse.
2.  Aggrieved Woman                                  : Excludes unmarried women living with their partners.
3.  Respondent                                        :  Limited to the husband or male relatives of the husband.
4.  Reliefs Available                                 :  Exclusively limited to monetary compensation.
5.  Jurisdiction                                       :  Cases can only be filed in the High Court.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, offers a broad definition of domestic violence and provides various reliefs.  Let's examine why each pair is incorrect:

1. **Domestic Violence:** The Act defines domestic violence broadly to encompass physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.  The statement is overly restrictive.

2. **Aggrieved Woman:**  The Act covers all women in domestic relationships, including unmarried women living with their partners.  The statement incorrectly excludes a significant group.

3. **Respondent:** The Act's definition of respondent includes the husband, relatives of the husband, or male partners and their relatives.  The statement's limitation to only the husband and his male relatives is inaccurate.

4. **Reliefs Available:** The Act provides for a range of reliefs, including monetary compensation, protection orders, custody of children, and residence orders.  The statement inaccurately limits reliefs to only monetary compensation.

5. **Jurisdiction:** The Act allows for cases to be filed in Magistrate courts, not exclusively in the High Court.


This question tests knowledge of the PWDVA's scope and application.  The distractors are carefully chosen to represent common misunderstandings or partial knowledge of the Act. The correct answer emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the law's provisions.


**4. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, consider the following pairs:**

   **Type of Surrogacy**                                  **Permissibility**
1.  Altruistic Surrogacy                               :  Prohibited
2.  Commercial Surrogacy                             :  Permitted with stringent conditions.
3.  Gestational Surrogacy with Donor Gametes         :  Permitted only if the intending couple has at least one biological gamete.
4.  Traditional Surrogacy                              :  Permitted only for infertile married couples.
5.  Surrogacy involving Foreign Nationals                :  Permitted under specific circumstances.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, aims to regulate surrogacy in India. The provided statements contain several inaccuracies. Let's analyze each:

1. **Altruistic Surrogacy:** The Act explicitly permits altruistic surrogacy. The statement is incorrect.

2. **Commercial Surrogacy:** The Act strictly prohibits commercial surrogacy. The statement is incorrect.

3. **Gestational Surrogacy with Donor Gametes:**  While the Act allows gestational surrogacy, the use of donor gametes is permitted only under specific conditions, including at least one biological gamete from the intending couple. The statement correctly describes the current situation.  However, it's crucial to note that this is a nuanced aspect of the law and not a simple "permitted" or "prohibited" scenario.

4. **Traditional Surrogacy:** The Act effectively prohibits traditional surrogacy by focusing on gestational surrogacy. The statement is incorrect.

5. **Surrogacy involving Foreign Nationals:** The Act explicitly prohibits surrogacy involving foreign nationals. The statement is incorrect.


The question tests knowledge of the Surrogacy Act's provisions and their implications. The distractors incorporate details close to the actual regulations, making the question challenging.  The correct answer emphasizes the need to understand the act's specific regulations and limitations.  The complexity of the Act's provisions makes simple categorization difficult.


**5. With reference to the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, consider the following pairs:**

   **Provision**                                  **Detail**
1.  Definition of Transgender Person             :  Exclusively includes individuals who have undergone gender affirmation surgery.
2.  Certificate of Identity                       :  Issued by the State Government only.
3.  Prohibition of Discrimination                 :  Limited to employment and education.
4.  Grievance Redressal Mechanism               :  Managed solely by the National Council for Transgender Persons.
5.  Right of Residence                           :  Guarantees that a child cannot be separated from parents based on their transgender identity, without a court order.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, aims to protect the rights of transgender persons.  Let's analyze the inaccuracies in the provided statements:

1. **Definition of Transgender Person:** The Act's definition is far broader than just those who have undergone gender affirmation surgery. It includes individuals whose gender identity differs from their assigned sex at birth, encompassing various identities.

2. **Certificate of Identity:** The certificate is issued by the District Magistrate, not solely by the State Government.

3. **Prohibition of Discrimination:** The Act prohibits discrimination across various aspects of life, including employment, education, healthcare, and access to services. The statement is too restrictive.

4. **Grievance Redressal Mechanism:** While the National Council for Transgender Persons plays a role, the grievance redressal process also involves other mechanisms at different levels. The statement is overly simplistic.

5. **Right of Residence:** The Act correctly protects the right of transgender children to remain with their families, unless there is a court order in the child's best interest.  This aspect is correctly stated. However, the phrasing makes it a less obvious correct match.


This question tests knowledge of the Transgender Persons Act and its provisions.  The distractors create plausible options by partially reflecting aspects of the Act but omitting crucial details, making it a demanding question for candidates.  The correct answer emphasizes the need for a thorough understanding of the act's scope and implementation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Village                     Defining Characteristic
1. ODF Village                         :   No visible faeces in the environment; every household and public institution uses safe faecal disposal.
2. ODF Plus Village                    :   Sustained ODF status and implemented solid or liquid waste management.
3. ODF Plus Model Village             :   Sustained ODF status; arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management; visual cleanliness; ODF Plus IEC messages displayed.
4.  Village with sustained ODF status  :  Has implemented only solid waste management systems.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The definitions provided for ODF, ODF Plus, and ODF Plus Model villages accurately reflect the criteria established for these designations.  An ODF (Open Defecation Free) village signifies the complete absence of open defecation, with all households and public facilities employing safe sanitation methods.  An ODF Plus village builds upon this by incorporating either solid or liquid waste management systems, indicating a more comprehensive approach to sanitation.  Finally, an ODF Plus Model village represents the highest level of achievement, incorporating both solid and liquid waste management, maintaining visual cleanliness (minimal litter, stagnant water, plastic waste), and actively disseminating ODF Plus information. Option 4 is incorrect as it describes a subset of ODF Plus villages and does not meet the full criteria for an ODF Plus Model village.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, missing key elements of the ODF Plus and ODF Plus Model village definitions.  Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incomplete definition of Option 4.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                         Report Published
1. UNFPA                               :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
2. UNDESA                              :   Global Food Policy Report 2023: Rethinking food crisis responses
3. UNHCR                              :   India Ageing Report 2023
4. IFPRI                               :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) publishes the State of World Population report, not the report on forced displacement. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) publishes reports such as the Population and Vital Statistics Report and World Social Report, not the Global Food Policy Report. The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) publishes the Global Trends: Forced Displacement report, not the India Ageing Report.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) publishes the Global Food Policy Report, making only pair 4 correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly attribute reports to organizations that did not produce them. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.  This question tests factual recall of organization-report pairings.


**3. With reference to Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Category of Tribal Group              Characteristic
1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :   Communities notified as "born criminals" during the British Raj.
2. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)           :   Centrally recognized special categories from among Scheduled Tribes.
3. Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes    :   Groups characterized by pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and declining populations.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

PVTGs are indeed centrally recognized special categories within the Scheduled Tribes, characterized by pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining population.  However, DNTs were those communities labelled "criminal tribes" during British rule, and this is the correct pairing for 2.  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes are not exclusively defined by the characteristics listed in pair 3; these are just some of their features, hence pair 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of different tribal group classifications in India.



**4. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Initiative                        Key Feature
1. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)       :   Establishes a National Research Foundation.
2. National Research Foundation (NRF)  :   Provides a digital platform for storing academic credits.
3. Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs): Aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) to 50% by 2035.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is designed to digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions, not to establish a research foundation.  The National Research Foundation (NRF) is indeed a key initiative under NEP 2020, aimed at boosting research and innovation.  The MERUs focus on multidisciplinary education and research, and while they contribute to increasing GER, the target of 50% by 2035 is a broader NEP goal, not a specific MERU objective.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question tests knowledge of NEP 2020 initiatives and their features.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                     Provision/Focus
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005  :  Criminalizes marital rape.
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971            :   Allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women.
3. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, focuses on civil remedies for domestic violence, not the criminalization of marital rape.  The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, does allow for termination of pregnancies up to 20 weeks for all women, making pair 2 correct. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, is specifically designed for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, making pair 3 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of various social welfare acts and their provisions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Initiative                Primary Goal
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                     :   Improve nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
2.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0       :   Provide universal health coverage without financial hardship.
3.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush           :   Increase immunization coverage among children and pregnant women.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to provide health insurance and improve access to healthcare services, not to focus solely on improving the nutritional and health status of young children and mothers.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 strengthen the Anganwadi system for early childhood care and nutrition, not universal health coverage.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush is specifically targeted to improve immunization rates, making pair 3 the only correct match.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly link schemes with goals they do not primarily address. This question assesses understanding of various government health initiatives and their main objectives.


**7. With reference to Global Indices, consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                       Focus Area
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                  :   Measures gender equality across various dimensions.
2. Global Gender Gap Index                     :   Tracks the progress of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)             :   Assesses the level of hunger and malnutrition across countries.
4. Gender Social Norms Index                   :   Measures the extent of universal health coverage.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) focuses on hunger and malnutrition levels, making this pairing correct.  The Global Gender Gap Index assesses gender equality, not hunger or SDGs.  The UHC Service Coverage Index tracks universal health coverage, not SDGs. The Gender Social Norms Index examines societal norms impacting gender equality, not universal health coverage.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of global indices and their respective themes.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Regulatory Body        Mandate
1. University Grants Commission (UGC)    :   Regulates dental education and profession.
2. National Medical Commission (NMC)    :   Accredits higher education institutions.
3. National Dental Commission (NDC)    :   Oversees medical education and practice.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The UGC primarily deals with the recognition and regulation of universities, not the accreditation of higher education institutions.  The NMC is the regulatory body for medical education and practice. The NDC is responsible for regulating dental education and the profession. Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  This question assesses understanding of the roles of various higher education regulatory bodies in India.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly pair the bodies with their mandates.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                     Headquarters
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) : Geneva, Switzerland
2. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Washington, D.C., USA
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) None.  The headquarters of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is Washington, D.C., USA, not Geneva, Switzerland. The headquarters of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is Geneva, Switzerland, not Washington, D.C., USA. The headquarters of the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is Geneva, Switzerland, not New York, USA. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests factual recall of the headquarters of significant international organizations.  Understanding the locations of these organizations helps in contextualizing their operations and influence within the global landscape.  Incorrect options are designed to be plausible distractors, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding locations and accurately recall the correct headquarters for each organization.


**2. With reference to organizations working on social issues, consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                 Mandate/Focus Area
1. UNFPA                                      :  Combating hunger globally
2. UNHCR                                      : Protecting the rights of indigenous peoples
3. UNPFII                                     :  Addressing forced displacement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 3 only. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) focuses on sexual and reproductive health, not combating hunger.  The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) addresses indigenous issues, including their rights. The mandate of UNHCR is to protect refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced people and stateless persons.  This question tests the understanding of the mandates of different UN organizations.  The incorrect options include organizations with mandates related to social issues but not the specific areas paired. The distractors test the candidate's knowledge of the nuances in the work of these organizations, requiring a deeper understanding than simple keyword matching.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy                                       Key Feature
1. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021       :  Allows commercial surrogacy
2. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 : Defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse
3. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 : Recognizes only 10 types of disabilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (d) None. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, defines domestic violence more broadly, encompassing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not just 10.  This question tests factual recall related to key legislation in India concerning social issues. The incorrect options present distorted or incomplete information about the Acts, requiring the candidate to have precise knowledge of their provisions.  The question highlights the importance of understanding the details of legislation, not just their broad themes.


**4. With reference to the Indian legal framework on child protection, consider the following pairs:**

Act/Law                                       Provision
1. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :  Sets the age of consent at 16 years.
2. POCSO Act, 2012                             :  Deals exclusively with child labour.
3. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023               :  Raises the age of consent for married women to 18 years.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct. The Juvenile Justice Act deals with the care and protection of children, but does not define the age of consent, which is covered under other legislation. The POCSO Act focuses on sexual offences against children, not child labour.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023,  raises the age of consent for sexual intercourse involving a married woman from 15 to 18 years. This question assesses understanding of the specific provisions within various Acts related to child protection. The distractors play on the general themes of child protection, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between the specific mandates of different laws.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Scheme/Initiative                        Focus Area
1. PM JANMAN                                      :  Empowering transgender individuals
2. SMILE (Support for Marginalised Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise) :  Providing basic facilities to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
3. Prayatna Project                               :  Skill development and livelihood support for transgender people


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct.  PM JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan) is a comprehensive initiative focused on providing basic facilities to PVTGs. SMILE is an umbrella scheme with multiple components, not solely focused on PVTGs. The Prayatna Project is a specific initiative aiming at skill development and livelihood support for transgender individuals. This question tests the knowledge of government schemes and their target beneficiaries.  The incorrect options mix and match schemes and their objectives, requiring the candidate to have precise knowledge to identify the correct pairing.  This tests not only factual recall but also the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding schemes.


**6. With reference to initiatives related to nutrition and sanitation, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                          Key Feature
1.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II    : Primarily focuses on urban sanitation.
2.  ODF Plus Model Village                          : Requires only solid waste management systems.
3.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan : Aims solely at reducing child mortality.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II focuses on rural sanitation. An ODF Plus Model Village requires both solid and liquid waste management systems.  The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan has a broader aim than solely reducing child mortality; it addresses various aspects of malnutrition and nutrition improvement among children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  This question tests the understanding of the scope and objectives of various government initiatives. The incorrect options present incomplete or inaccurate descriptions of the initiatives, requiring a detailed understanding of their features and goals.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Higher Education Initiatives                        Characteristic
1. National Credit Framework (NCrF)               :  Limits credit accumulation to higher education.
2.  National Accreditation Council (NAC)           :  Is solely responsible for accrediting schools.
3.  Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs)            :  Cannot offer graduate, postgraduate, or doctoral degrees.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Credit Framework (NCrF) integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education. The National Accreditation Council (NAC) is also responsible for accrediting higher education institutions. Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) can offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees.  This question tests knowledge of higher education policies and their characteristics.  The incorrect options offer incomplete or inaccurate descriptions of the initiatives, requiring a detailed understanding of their functionalities to select the correct option.  The question emphasizes the need for precise knowledge of these initiatives.


**8. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

Country/Region                                 GHI Status/Score
1. India                                         :  Ranked among the lowest hunger levels globally.
2. South Asia                                   :  Shows significant improvement in hunger levels since 2015.
3. Sub-Saharan Africa                           :  Has a GHI score similar to South Asia.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct. India's GHI ranking is not among the lowest globally. South Asia shows limited progress in reducing hunger since 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have similar GHI scores.  This question tests knowledge of the Global Hunger Index and its regional variations.  The distractors use generalizations about hunger levels and trends, requiring the candidate to precisely recall the GHI data and interpretations for specific regions.  The question highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of global hunger data.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Key Feature
1. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                    :   Provides concessional loans for sanitation equipment
2. NAMASTE scheme                            :   Promotes 100% mechanization of sanitation
3. PM Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan          :   Aims to address infrastructure gaps in 63,000 tribal villages
4.  Ni-Kshay Poshan Yojana (NPY)           :   All notified tuberculosis patients are beneficiaries
5.  Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana : Provides health cover of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for primary care hospitalization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Swachhta Udyami Yojana indeed offers concessional loans to procure sanitation equipment.  NAMASTE (National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem) scheme explicitly focuses on complete mechanization of sanitation processes.  PM Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan targets infrastructural improvement in approximately 63,000 tribal villages.  However, while Ni-Kshay Poshan Yojana (NPY) does support TB patients, it doesn't cover *all* notified patients; the coverage is more nuanced and may depend on specific criteria.  Similarly, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana provides a health cover of ₹5 lakhs per family annually, but the statement about primary care hospitalization is an oversimplification; it covers secondary and tertiary care as well.  Therefore, only the first three pairs are entirely accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include either partially or wholly inaccurate statements.


**2. With reference to Government Initiatives for Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                  Specific Focus
1.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs : Improves educational empowerment of Denotified Tribes
2.  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme                    : Construction of hostels for DNTs boys and girls
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) : Provides free competitive exam coaching to DNTs students
4.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) : Prepares a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs
5.  International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples  : Observed annually on August 9th to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the first four pairs accurately reflect the stated objectives of the respective initiatives concerning Denotified Tribes (DNTs). The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship scheme is indeed focused on improving educational opportunities for DNTs.  The Nanaji Deshmukh scheme provides hostel facilities, SEED offers competitive exam coaching, and the NCDNT is responsible for compiling state-wise lists of DNT castes. The fifth pair is also correct but it is outside the scope of government initiatives for tribal welfare. Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Aspect                             Specific Goal/Feature
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education :  To reach at least 50% by 2035
2.  New Curricular and Pedagogical Structure     :  5+3+3+4 design of schooling
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)           :  To catalyse research and innovation
4.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                : To digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions
5.  PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review, and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development): To assess the performance of the school education system at the State and District level


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 does indeed aim for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035.  The policy also introduced the 5+3+3+4 schooling structure. The establishment of the NRF to boost research and innovation is a key component.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is designed to digitally store academic credits. PARAKH is a separate assessment mechanism, not directly a feature of NEP 2020, although it aligns with the policy's overall goals. Hence, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete; only option (d) accurately matches all the relevant pairs.


**4. With reference to  Organizations involved in Global Social Issues, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Key Mandate/Focus
1.  UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund)       :  To achieve three zeros by 2030 (zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths, zero gender-based violence)
2.  UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) : Releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report
3.  UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) : Works to save lives, protect rights, and build a better future for people forcibly displaced
4.  WFP (World Food Programme)                  : Brings life-saving food to people displaced by conflict and disasters
5.  IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) : Provides research-based policy solutions for reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs correctly link the organization with its primary mandate or area of focus. UNFPA's "three zeros" goal is well-known. UNDESA publishes the SDG Progress Report. UNHCR's work with refugees is central to its mission. WFP focuses on food aid in crisis situations.  IFPRI's research contributes to reducing poverty and hunger. Therefore, option (d), which includes all five pairs, is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Salient Feature
1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005: Defines domestic violence to include physical, verbal, emotional, economic, or sexual abuse
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (amended 2021) : Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks in specific categories of women
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) : Bans manual scavenging and mandates rehabilitation measures
4.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           : Allows only altruistic surrogacy and penalizes commercial surrogacy
5.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) : Recognizes 21 types of disabilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a key feature of the respective act or policy.  The PWDVA's broad definition of domestic violence is correct. The MTP Act's provisions regarding abortion up to 24 weeks (with specific exceptions) are accurate.  The PEMSR Act correctly reflects its ban on manual scavenging and rehabilitation components. The Surrogacy Act accurately depicts its focus on altruistic surrogacy and the penalization of commercial surrogacy. The RPwD Act correctly mentions the recognition of 21 types of disabilities.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as all the pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete.


**1. With reference to the Anganwadi system and associated schemes, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                     Associated Ministry/Organization
1. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0:   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2. Poshan Tracker App                    :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
3. National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children:  National Rural Health Mission
4.  Anganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana:    Life Insurance Corporation of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The Poshan Tracker app is indeed a mobile-based application used by Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) under the MoWCD for monitoring nutrition service delivery. The National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children is also launched by MoWCD, not the National Rural Health Mission.  The Anganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana (AKBY) is a government-sponsored insurance scheme, not directly administered by LIC, although LIC might be one of the providers. The other options incorrectly link various schemes and initiatives to the wrong ministries or organizations, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the administrative structure and implementation of these crucial social welfare programs.


**2. With reference to initiatives related to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                   Primary Focus/Objective
1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                 :  Primary healthcare services only
2. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) :  National portability of health records
3. National Health Policy 2017              :  Achieving UHC by 2047
4. Intensified Mission Indradhanush        :  Improving maternal and child health

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The ABDM aims to improve access to quality healthcare through technology and enables national portability of health services.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on improving immunization coverage for children and pregnant women, thus directly contributing to maternal and child health.  However, Ayushman Bharat Yojana (ABY) is not limited to primary healthcare; it addresses health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. The National Health Policy 2017 aims at achieving UHC, but not by 2047; the timeframe is not explicitly stated as a target year.  The incorrect pairings highlight a lack of precise knowledge about the scope and objectives of these UHC initiatives.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) and related data, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                 India's Status/Ranking (GHI 2023)
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) Score          :  101st among 125 countries
2. Undernourishment Prevalence            :  17.6%
3. Child Stunting Prevalence              :  34.5%
4. Child Wasting Prevalence               :  19.7%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1,2,3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  India's child stunting and wasting prevalence rates in the 2023 GHI report were approximately 35.5% and 18.7% respectively.  However, India's GHI score was 28.7, placing it at 111th, not 101st. The undernourishment prevalence was reported as 16.6%, not 17.6%. The incorrect matches demonstrate a need for precise recall of the numerical data presented in the GHI report.  A superficial understanding of the GHI's key findings would lead to inaccurate matching.


**4. With reference to the Open Defecation Free (ODF) status and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Status/Initiative                          Defining Characteristic
1. ODF Status                                :  Complete absence of visible faeces in the environment
2. ODF Plus Village                          :  Sustained ODF status with solid waste management only
3. ODF Plus Model Village                   :  Sustained ODF status, solid and liquid waste management, and visual cleanliness
4. Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase II:  Achieved 100% ODF Plus status by September 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. ODF status is defined by the absence of visible faeces and the use of safe sanitation technology. An ODF Plus Model Village goes beyond basic ODF status by having arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, maintaining visual cleanliness, and displaying IEC messages.  However, an ODF Plus village doesn't require *only* solid waste management; it can include either solid or liquid waste management systems.  Also, by September 2023, 75%, not 100%, of Indian villages had achieved ODF Plus status under Phase II of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen).  The incorrect pairings highlight the need for a precise understanding of the definitions and criteria associated with ODF status and its different levels.


**5. With reference to organizations involved in international development and humanitarian aid, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Primary Mandate/Focus
1. UNFPA                                      :  Combating hunger and food insecurity
2. UNDESA                                    :  Monitoring and reporting on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
3. UNCRC                                     :  Protecting the rights of children
4. WFP                                        :  Providing humanitarian aid during natural disasters only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. UNDESA's primary role is to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including monitoring progress on the SDGs.  UNCRC monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  However, UNFPA's mandate is focused on sexual and reproductive health and rights, not combating hunger. While WFP does provide humanitarian aid during disasters, its mandate is broader, encompassing food assistance in various contexts, not limited to only natural disasters.  The incorrect pairings show a lack of understanding of the specific roles and functions of these different UN agencies.



**6.  With reference to key government schemes for social welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Target Beneficiary Group
1. Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana  :  Anganwadi Workers
2. Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana    :  Farmers
3. PM Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan        :  Tribal communities
4.  Ni-Kshay Poshan Yojana                 :  Tuberculosis patients


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  PM Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) targets tribal-majority villages for development.  Ni-Kshay Poshan Yojana provides nutritional support to tuberculosis patients.  However, PMJJBY and PMSBY are insurance schemes for individuals, not specifically targeted at Anganwadi workers or farmers.  The incorrect pairings illustrate the need for precise knowledge of the beneficiary groups covered by each scheme.  A general understanding of the schemes' purpose is insufficient for accurate matching.


**7. With reference to recent reports and publications on social issues, consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Publication                         Key Finding/Focus
1. Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report :  Global Hunger Index
2. Global Food Policy Report 2023            :  Impact of multiple crises on food insecurity
3. India Ageing Report 2023                  :  Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in India
4.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023:  Status of women’s empowerment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Global Food Policy Report 2023 indeed focuses on the impact of various crises on global food insecurity.  The other pairings are incorrect. The "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" is about forced migration, not the Global Hunger Index. The "India Ageing Report 2023" deals with demographic trends related to aging, not ODF status. The SDG Progress Report 2023 covers progress on various SDGs, not specifically on women's empowerment, although it might include data on that as well. The incorrect pairings highlight the importance of carefully reading and understanding the focus of each report before attempting to match them to the described findings.  Superficial knowledge will lead to errors.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                       Implementing Ministry
1. Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri-Jan Arogya Yojana: Ministry of Women and Child Development
2. Intensified Mission Indradhanush           : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
3. Samarth Scheme                              : Ministry of Textiles
4. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0        : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri-Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) is implemented by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on improving immunization coverage and is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, making pair 2 correct. The Samarth Scheme is a skill development program under the Ministry of Textiles, making pair 3 correct. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, an initiative to strengthen Anganwadi centers and improve nutrition, falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.  Only pairs 2 and 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative                     Primary Goal
1. Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana : Providing quality generic medicines at affordable prices
2. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana              : Enhancing entrepreneurship by providing loans up to ₹20 lakh
3. PM-YASASVI Scheme                       : Streamlined educational support for socially and economically disadvantaged students
4. Rajya Vishisht Yojana                     : Reducing stubble burning incidents


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) aims to provide affordable generic medicines, aligning with pair 1. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) indeed aims to enhance entrepreneurship through loans, although the loan limit is now ₹20 lakh, making pair 2 correct.  The PM-YASASVI Scheme focuses on providing educational support to disadvantaged students, matching pair 3. The Rajya Vishisht Yojana is a Haryana government initiative designed to reduce stubble burning, accurately reflecting pair 4. All four pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                            Key Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                   : Global Report on Food Crisis
2. UNDESA                                  : Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3. UNCRC                                   : Guidance on children’s right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment
4. WFP                                     : India Ageing Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) releases the State of World Population report, not the Global Report on Food Crisis, which is published by the World Food Programme (WFP). Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) correctly released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023, making pair 2 correct. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) did indeed issue guidance on children's rights to a clean environment, making pair 3 correct.  The India Ageing Report 2023 was released by UNFPA in collaboration with IIPS, not WFP; therefore, pair 4 is incorrect. Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                    Organization/Body
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023              : World Economic Forum
2. Global Gender Gap Index 2023                : Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)             : WHO and World Bank
4. Gender Social Norms Index                     :  United Nations Development Programme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Economic Forum.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Index is indeed published annually by the World Economic Forum; thus, pair 2 is incorrect. The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) is correctly attributed to the WHO and World Bank, making pair 3 correct. The Gender Social Norms Index is accurately linked to the United Nations Development Programme, making pair 4 correct.  Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Feature
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 : Defines domestic violence to include only physical abuse
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971     : Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks in specific cases
3. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021              : Allows commercial surrogacy
4. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Bans manual scavenging but lacks provisions for rehabilitation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, defines domestic violence comprehensively, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances, making pair 2 correct. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy.  Pair 3 is incorrect. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers. Pair 4 is incorrect. Only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**6. With reference to Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

    Functionary                                     Key Role/Benefit
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)                      : Primarily focuses on maternal and child health promotion
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)                : Provides early childhood care and development
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA)    : Receives task-based incentives in addition to a fixed monthly incentive
4. Anganwadi Helper (AWH)                     : Paid fixed honorarium per month


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

AWWs play a crucial role in providing early childhood care and development,  making pair 1 incorrect. ANMs primarily focus on maternal and child health, making pair 2 incorrect. ASHAs do receive task-based incentives, making pair 3 correct. AWHs receive a fixed monthly honorarium, making pair 4 correct. Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.



**7. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    NEP 2020 Feature                             Description
1. Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) : Aim to achieve the highest standards for multidisciplinary education.
2. National Research Foundation (NRF)          : To catalyze and expand research and innovation.
3. National Educational Technology Forum (NETF): To solely focus on enhancing learning in schools.
4. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)               : To digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The description of MERUs in pair 1 is accurate. The NRF's role in pair 2 aligns with NEP 2020 goals.  The NETF's scope extends to both schools and higher education, making pair 3 incorrect. The ABC's function in pair 4 is correctly described.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Mandate/Focus
1. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI): Accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on Paris Principles.
2. UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) : Dealing exclusively with indigenous peoples' economic development.
3. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR): Protecting the rights of internally displaced persons only.
4. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI): Providing research-based policy solutions for reducing poverty and hunger.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GANHRI's mandate accurately reflects its role in accrediting NHRIs according to the Paris Principles, making pair 1 correct.  The UNPFII addresses a broader range of indigenous issues beyond just economic development, making pair 2 incorrect. UNHCR's work encompasses refugees and asylum-seekers, not just internally displaced persons, making pair 3 incorrect. IFPRI's focus on poverty and hunger reduction aligns with its mission, making pair 4 correct. Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.



**1. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Feature
1. Saksham Anganwadis : Focuses on Adolescent Girls (14-18 years) in Aspirational Districts and NER
2. POSHAN Abhiyan      : Aims to reduce stunting in districts with high malnutrition burden
3. ICDS-CAS            : A six-tier dashboard replacing registers with smartphones for data capture
4.  Anganwadi Workers : Paid a fixed monthly honorarium and performance-linked incentives.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Saksham Anganwadis, a targeted intervention under the Anganwadi Services Scheme, explicitly focuses on strengthening and upgrading Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) to enhance efficiency and effectiveness, with a particular emphasis on adolescent girls in Aspirational Districts and the North Eastern Region (NER). POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) aims to reduce stunting, a major nutritional deficiency, in districts with the highest malnutrition burden by improving the utilization of key Anganwadi services. ICDS-CAS (Integrated Child Development Services-Common Application Software) is a digital platform that uses smartphones to capture data, replacing traditional paper registers, thereby improving data management and service delivery. Finally, Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium and additional performance-linked incentives, ensuring their compensation is aligned with their work and contribution.  These facts are demonstrably true based on the provided text.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 sets ambitious targets for increasing the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to at least 50% by 2035, reflecting a commitment to expanding access to higher education.  A key feature of the NEP 2020 is the promotion of multidisciplinary education, achieved through the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) across India to foster interdisciplinary learning and research. The policy also establishes the National Research Foundation (NRF) to significantly boost research and innovation across all fields of study, strengthening the research ecosystem.  Finally, the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a crucial digital platform designed to store and manage the academic credits earned by students from various institutions, promoting flexibility and mobility within the education system.  These facts are clearly stated within the given information.


**3. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following pairs:**

    Act Provision                                      Specific Detail
1. PEMSR Act                                        :  Bans the practice of manual scavenging
2.  PEMSR Act, Rehabilitation Component             : Provides alternative employment training to manual scavengers
3. PEMSR Act, Punishment Clause                     : Imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both
4. NAMASTE Scheme                                   :  Promotes 100% mechanization of sanitation work


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PEMSR Act explicitly prohibits the practice of manual scavenging, a hazardous and dehumanizing form of labor. The Act also includes a comprehensive rehabilitation component that aims to provide alternative employment opportunities and training to manual scavengers, helping them transition to safer and more dignified work.  The Act prescribes penalties for violations, including imprisonment up to two years and/or a fine up to one lakh rupees.  The NAMASTE scheme, a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, directly supports the goals of the PEMSR Act by promoting 100% mechanization of sanitation work, thereby further reducing the reliance on manual scavenging.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched according to the provided information.


**4. With reference to  Child Labour in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                                 Key Feature
1. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016 : Prohibits employment of children below 14 years
2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme            : Opens Special Schools/Rehabilitation Centres for child labourers
3. PENCiL Portal                                        : A tool for rescuing and rehabilitating child labour victims
4. ILO Convention 182                                  : Concerns the Worst Forms of Child Labour


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act of 2016 explicitly prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in all forms of work. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme plays a crucial role in rehabilitating child labourers by establishing Special Schools and Rehabilitation Centres to provide education and vocational training. The PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal acts as a vital tool for identifying, rescuing, and rehabilitating victims of child labour.  India has also ratified ILO Convention 182, which specifically addresses the worst forms of child labour, demonstrating a commitment to international standards in combating child labour.  All four pairs accurately reflect the features of these acts and schemes.


**5. With reference to  Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                  Specific Provision
1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 : Allows institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtbU status
2. National Credit Framework (NCrF)                     : Integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education
3. NEP 2020                                            : Aims for a 50% GER in Higher Education by 2035
4.  National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019       : Oversees medical education and practice in India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, significantly amended the eligibility criteria for institutions seeking Deemed-to-be-University (DtbU) status, allowing institutions less than 20 years old to apply. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is a groundbreaking initiative that seamlessly integrates credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational/skill education, enhancing flexibility and mobility for learners. The NEP 2020 sets a target of achieving a 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education by 2035. The National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, established the NMC as the regulatory body for medical education and practice in India.  All four pairs accurately reflect the features of these acts and policies.


**1. With reference to indices measuring women's empowerment and gender equality, consider the following pairs:**

Index Name                                     Releasing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index                     :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index                  :   World Economic Forum
3. Women’s Empowerment Index                  :   UN Women and UNDP
4. Global Gender Parity Index                  :   World Bank


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.  The UNDP releases the Gender Social Norms Index, which aims to understand systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by women worldwide.  The Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) are indeed jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP. The World Bank is not associated with these indices. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because the Global Gender Gap Index is not released by the UNDP. Option (b) is incorrect as it only includes the correctly matched pair 3, omitting the other correctly matched pair, 4. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 2.


**2. With reference to the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI), consider the following pairs:**

Indicator Category                                    Description
1. Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health :   Tracks SDG 3.8.1
2. Infectious diseases                               :   Measured on a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)
3. Non-communicable diseases                       :   Includes four indicator categories
4. Service capacity and access                       :   Released by WHO and World Bank


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UHC SCI does indeed include the four indicator categories listed (reproductive health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and service capacity and access).  It also tracks SDG 3.8.1.  However, the statement that infectious diseases are measured on a scale from 0 to 100 is incorrect; this applies to the overall SCI score, not individual categories.  The statement that non-communicable diseases includes four indicator categories is also incorrect; the four categories are part of the overall SCI, not a subset of non-communicable diseases. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 4. Option (c) is incorrect as it only includes the correctly matched pair 4, while omitting pair 1. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes incorrectly matched pairs 2 and 3.


**3. With reference to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following pairs:**

NIF Element                                    Characteristic
1. Number of indicators in NIF, 2023          :   231
2. Global Indicator Framework (GIF)            :   Framed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs)
3. State Indicator Framework (SIF)              :   Developed and circulated by MoSPI to States/UTs in 2019
4.  IAEG-SDGs                                  :   India represented Southern Asia during 2021-2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NIF 2023 includes 284 indicators, not 231.  The GIF is indeed framed by the IAEG-SDGs, and the MoSPI did develop and circulate guidelines for SIFs to States/UTs in 2019.  India also represented Southern Asia in the IAEG-SDGs during 2021-2023. Thus, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 3. Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched pair 3. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 1.


**4. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

PGI Aspect                                  Characteristic
1.  Data Source                               :    National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2022
2. Highest Grade Attained in PGI 2.0         :    Daksh
3. Number of Grades in PGI                     :    Ten
4.  PGI-D Report Period                         :    2020-21 only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PGI uses UDISE+ 2021-22 data and NAS 2021 data, not NAS 2022.  In PGI 2.0, no state/UT attained the highest grade (Daksh); the top grade achieved was Prachesta-2.  The PGI does indeed have ten grades. The PGI-D report combined data from 2020-21 and 2021-22.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs 1, 2, and 4, respectively.


**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

NCrF Element                                 Characteristic
1.  Levels 1-4                               :   Higher Education
2.  Levels 4.5-8                             :   School Education
3.  Total Notional Learning Hours/Year       :    1200
4.  National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF):   Integrated with NCrF


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Levels 1-4 in the NCrF refer to school education, and levels 4.5-8 refer to higher education, making pairs 1 and 2 incorrect. The total notional learning hours per year are indeed fixed at 1200, and the NSQF is integrated into the NCrF.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the number of correctly matched pairs.


**6. With reference to the accreditation of higher education institutions, consider the following pairs:**

Accreditation Aspect                           Characteristic
1.  K. Radhakrishnan Committee Recommendation:   Transition to a 5-point grading system
2.  National Accreditation Council (NAC)       :   Envisioned as a meta-accrediting body
3.  Composite Assessment System (CAS)         :   Amalgamates Programme and Institution Accreditation
4.  Binary Accreditation System                 :    Accredited and Not Accredited


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The K. Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited and Not Accredited), not a 5-point grading system. The NAC is indeed envisioned as a meta-accrediting body, the CAS amalgamates programme and institution accreditation, and the binary system is as described. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) is incorrect because it only includes the incorrectly matched pair 1. Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched pair 4. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 1.


**7. With reference to the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) Report, consider the following pairs:**

NFHS-5 Aspect                                      Data Point (Illustrative- not actual data)
1.  Total Fertility Rate (Illustrative Data)          :   1.8
2.  Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (Illustrative Data) :   60%
3.  Institutional Delivery Rate (Illustrative Data)    :   85%
4.  Prevalence of Anaemia among Women (Illustrative Data) :   45%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) All four
(b) Only three
(c) Only two
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

While precise figures are not provided in the source text for NFHS-5,  it is a known fact that NFHS-5 reports on all these aspects: Total Fertility Rate, Contraceptive Prevalence Rate, Institutional Delivery Rate, and Prevalence of Anaemia among Women.  The values provided in the pairs are illustrative and could vary depending on the specific state/region analyzed in the report. However, the pairs themselves are correctly matched in terms of the data points reported in the NFHS-5. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched in principle. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not reflect the accurate number of correctly matched pairs.  The key is recognizing the principle of the data points being reported, regardless of the specific values.


**8.  With reference to the  Anganwadi System, consider the following pairs:**

Anganwadi System Aspect                        Characteristic
1.  Primary Goal                               :   Adolescent girl empowerment
2.  Funding Source                              :   Primarily State Governments
3.  Key Personnel                              :   Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs)
4.  Digital Initiative                           :   Poshan Tracker


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While the Anganwadi system contributes to adolescent girl empowerment, its primary goal is broader, encompassing the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers. The Anganwadi system is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, but states also contribute funding.  AWWs and AWHs are indeed key personnel, and the Poshan Tracker is a significant digital initiative. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 2, respectively.


**9. With reference to the  Caste Census, consider the following pairs:**

Caste Census Aspect                           Characteristic
1.  Constitutional Provision                   :   Article 246
2.  Conducting Authority                      :   Ministry of Rural Development
3.  Last Full Caste Enumeration               :   1931
4.  Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011 :   Caste data published in 2016


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Census is a Union subject under Entry 69 of the Union List, not Article 246. The Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, under the Ministry of Home Affairs, is entrusted with conducting the decadal census, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  The last full caste enumeration was indeed in 1931.  The SECC, 2011, did not publish caste data in 2016; only other data were published. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs 1, 2, and 4, respectively.


**10. With reference to  organizations related to human rights, consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                      Characteristic
1.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)      :   Accredited by GANHRI in 2017
2.  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) :   Established in 1993
3.  UN Human Rights Council                      :   Reviews and accredits NHRIs
4. Paris Principles                               :  Adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1993


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

The NHRC's accreditation by GANHRI was deferred multiple times, and it was not accredited in 2017. GANHRI was indeed established in 1993.  The UN Human Rights Council does not review and accredit NHRIs; that is the role of GANHRI. The Paris Principles were adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1993.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 3, respectively.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                      Releasing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index                  :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index               :   World Economic Forum
3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index :   World Health Organization and World Bank
4. Women’s Empowerment Index             :   UN Women and UNDP
5. Global Gender Parity Index               :   UN Women and UNDP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index is indeed jointly released by the World Health Organization and the World Bank.  The Women’s Empowerment Index and the Global Gender Parity Index are both jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP.  However, the Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the United Nations Development Programme, not the World Economic Forum. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The other pairs demonstrate a common error in associating indices with incorrect organizations, highlighting the need for precise knowledge in UPSC preparation.  Understanding the nuances of these indices and their releasing bodies is crucial for comprehending global development goals and initiatives.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Parameter                                  Value in GHI 2023 (India)
1. Undernourishment                         :   18.7%
2. Child Stunting                              :   35.5%
3. Child Wasting                               :   16.6%
4. Child Mortality                             :   3.1%
5. GHI Score (India)                         :   27.0

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2023 report for India correctly indicates child stunting at 35.5% and child mortality at 3.1%.  However, the values for undernourishment and child wasting are incorrectly assigned in the question.  Undernourishment in India was 16.6%, and child wasting was 18.7%. The GHI score for India in 2023 was 28.7, not 27.0.  This question tests the ability to recall precise data from a specific report, a critical skill for UPSC aspirants.  Incorrectly recalling even one value signifies a lack of thorough preparation, emphasizing the importance of precise factual recall in answering such questions.  The inclusion of a plausible distractor (a close but incorrect GHI score) further increases the question's difficulty.


**3. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Worker Category                           Key Role
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)                  :   Focuses on promotion of Maternal and Child Health, including immunizations
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)            :   Providing early childhood care and development
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) :   Create awareness on factors that determine health status

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Anganwadi Worker's (AWW) primary role is indeed focused on early childhood care and development.  Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) play a key role in creating awareness about health determinants. However, the role of the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) is incorrectly paired. ANMs primarily focus on the promotion of maternal and child health, including immunizations. This question tests the understanding of the roles of different community health workers within the Indian healthcare system, requiring both factual recall and conceptual understanding.  The incorrect pairing of ANMs serves as a significant distractor, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of these roles and their respective responsibilities in the UPSC context.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Key Provision
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :   Allows commercial surrogacy
2. Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 :   Regulates ART clinics and banks
3. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :   Allows termination up to 24 weeks for all women
4. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013  :   Bans manual scavenging

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, accurately regulates ART clinics and banks. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, correctly bans manual scavenging. However, the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, only permits altruistic surrogacy, not commercial surrogacy.  The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women, and beyond 20 weeks under specific conditions, not up to 24 weeks for all. This question evaluates the understanding of key legislation related to reproductive rights and social justice in India. The incorrect pairings highlight the importance of precise knowledge of the provisions of these Acts for UPSC preparation. The plausible distractors underscore the difficulty level of the question.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   NEP Feature                                   Implementation Detail
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target       :   100% by 2035 in higher education
2.  Multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees :   Certification after the first year, diploma after the second year
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)          :   To catalyze research and innovation
4.  National Credit Framework (NCF)            :   To integrate credits from school, higher, and vocational education
5.  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)           :   To store academic credits earned from various institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 accurately reflect the features and implementation details of the NEP 2020.  The NEP does indeed propose multiple exit options with certifications and diplomas at different stages of undergraduate study.  The NRF is designed to boost research and innovation. The NCF aims to integrate credits across different educational levels. The ABC is intended as a repository for academic credits.  However, the GER target of 50% by 2035 in higher education is incorrectly stated as 100% in the question. This question assesses the understanding of the key tenets and implementation strategies of the NEP 2020.  The inclusion of the partially incorrect pair (GER target) acts as a strong distractor, testing the ability to differentiate between accurate and slightly inaccurate information—a critical skill for UPSC success.  The question demands precise knowledge of the NEP's details.


**6.  With reference to Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                          Description
1.  International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples :   Observed on August 9th
2.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)   :   First recognized in 2006
3.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                    :   Communities notified as 'born criminal' during British rule
4.  Vimukta Jatis Day                           :   Celebrated on August 31st by DNT communities
5.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) :  To prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is indeed observed on August 9th. Denotified Tribes were indeed labelled as "born criminals" during British rule. Vimukta Jatis Day is celebrated on August 31st by DNT communities. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is tasked with preparing state-wise lists of DNT castes. However, PVTGs were first recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), not in 2006.  The renaming to PVTGs happened later. This question assesses the knowledge of terminology and key initiatives related to tribal welfare in India.  The incorrect pairing of PVTGs' recognition year serves as a crucial distractor, emphasizing the need for precise chronological knowledge. This highlights the importance of detailed understanding of the historical context and current policies related to tribal welfare.  The question's difficulty is enhanced by the need to recall specific dates and terminology.



**7. With reference to organizations related to population and development, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Key Function/Report
1. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)   :   Releases the World Social Report
2. UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) :   Releases the State of World Population report
3. UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD) :   Monitors implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action
4. World Food Programme (WFP)               :   Focuses primarily on food security and hunger eradication

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD) accurately monitors the implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action. The World Food Programme (WFP) is correctly known for its focus on food security and hunger eradication. However, the UNFPA releases the State of World Population report, not the World Social Report (UNDESA releases that report).  The UNDESA does not release the State of World Population report; the UNFPA does. This question assesses the understanding of the mandates and activities of various UN organizations involved in population and development issues. The incorrect pairings serve as strong distractors, testing detailed knowledge of the roles of these organizations. The question's difficulty is increased by the subtle differences in the functions of similar organizations, demanding precise knowledge for correct matching.


**8. With reference to  Indian Healthcare Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                   Primary Goal
1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                    :   Improve equitable access to quality healthcare using technology
2. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)  :   Holistic address of health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels
3. National Health Policy 2017               :   Achieve Universal Health Coverage
4. Intensified Mission Indradhanush           :   Reduce stunting in districts with high malnutrition burden
5. POSHAN Abhiyan                            :   Reach zero-dose children aged 0-5 years and pregnant women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The National Health Policy 2017 does indeed aim to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC).  However, the other pairings are incorrect. Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims for holistic healthcare at all levels, while ABDM focuses on technological improvement for equitable access.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets vaccination coverage, not stunting reduction (that's POSHAN Abhiyan's goal). POSHAN Abhiyan aims to improve nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children, not specifically zero-dose children (although that is a component of a broader strategy).  This question tests the understanding of key Indian healthcare initiatives and their specific goals. The numerous incorrect pairings act as powerful distractors, requiring precise knowledge of each initiative for a correct match. The question underscores the need for detailed knowledge of government schemes and programs within the Indian healthcare context.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Headquarters Location
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Geneva, Switzerland
2. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Washington, D.C., USA
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA
4. UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)      : Rome, Italy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR's headquarters is located in Geneva, Switzerland.  The IFPRI is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA. GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland.  The UNPFII is based in New York, USA. Therefore, only the statement regarding the UNHCR's headquarters location is correct. The other pairs incorrectly match the organizations with their headquarters.  This question tests factual recall of the headquarters locations of international organizations, a common theme in UPSC examinations.  Understanding the locations of these organizations is crucial for comprehending their influence and operations within the global geopolitical landscape. The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, as many aspirants may confuse the locations of these organizations.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                     India's GHI Score
1. 2015                                    :   28.7
2. 2023                                    :   29.2
3. 2023                                    :   Ranked 101st

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

In 2023, India's GHI score was 28.7, and it was ranked 111th among 125 countries.  The provided options incorrectly state India's GHI score for 2015 and its rank in 2023.  The question tests the ability to recall specific numerical data related to the GHI, demonstrating knowledge of global hunger indicators and India's performance in this area. The incorrect options are carefully constructed to resemble the actual data, increasing the difficulty and testing the examinee's precise recall ability.  The subtle differences in numbers and ranks make simple guessing unlikely.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Feature
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005  : Defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse
2. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021             : Allows commercial surrogacy
3. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 : Permits abortion up to 24 weeks for all women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 defines domestic violence broadly, encompassing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 prohibits commercial surrogacy, only allowing altruistic surrogacy. The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women and up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances.  This question tests understanding of key provisions of significant social legislation in India.  The incorrect options present common misconceptions or outdated information regarding these acts, requiring a thorough understanding of the legal frameworks. The question assesses both factual recall and the ability to evaluate the accuracy of statements concerning legal provisions.


**4. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan), consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                                  Objective
1. Saksham Anganwadis                         :  Focus solely on children aged 0-6 years
2. Poshan Tracker App                            : Primarily for monitoring adult nutrition
3. Intensified Mission Indradhanush              :  Targets only pregnant women for vaccination

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Saksham Anganwadis aim to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of Anganwadi Centers, focusing on children (0-6 years), adolescent girls, and early childhood care and education. The Poshan Tracker app is used for monitoring and tracking nutrition service delivery for children and pregnant women. Intensified Mission Indradhanush aims to reach zero-dose children aged between 0 and 5 years and pregnant women who have missed any vaccine doses. This question assesses the understanding of India's public health initiatives, specifically those related to nutrition and immunization.  The incorrect options present oversimplified or inaccurate descriptions of the programs' objectives, testing the ability to evaluate the accuracy of statements concerning government programs and policies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                         Report Published
1.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)            :  Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2.  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) :  India Ageing Report 2023
3.  Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India :  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
4.  World Health Organization (WHO)                   :  Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA publishes the State of World Population report, not the Global Trends report on forced displacement. UNDESA publishes the World Social Report and other reports related to sustainable development, not the India Ageing Report.  The Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India conducts and publishes census data, not the SDG Progress Report.  The WHO did publish the report on the burden of disease attributable to unsafe WASH services. Therefore, only the pairing of the WHO with its report is correct. This question tests the knowledge of various international and national organizations and their respective publications. The incorrect options are designed to test the understanding of the organizations and their area of expertise.


**6. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State                                      Characteristic
1. Madhya Pradesh                              : Lowest population of STs in absolute numbers
2. Odisha                                     : Highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
3. Chhattisgarh                               :  Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are *not* listed as PVTGs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of STs in absolute numbers. Odisha does indeed have the highest number of PVTGs in India. The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. This question tests the knowledge of the geographical distribution of Scheduled Tribes and PVTGs in India. The incorrect options use contrasting statements to create confusion, demanding precise knowledge of the subject matter rather than general understanding.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislation                                   Provision
1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Does not criminalize employing manual scavengers
2.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016  : Mandates 4% reservation in all government jobs, including police forces
3.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 :  Requires all workplaces with more than 10 employees to have an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, criminalizes the employment of manual scavengers and the construction of insanitary latrines. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates reservation for PwDs in government jobs, but this exclusion applies to police forces. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013 correctly mandates ICCs in workplaces with 10 or more employees. This question assesses knowledge of key social legislation in India and tests the understanding of specific provisions within those laws.  The distractors involve subtle inaccuracies that require careful reading and understanding of the legal frameworks.


**8. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Area                                           Key Provision
1.  Higher Education                             :  Reduction of the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) target to 40% by 2035
2.  School Education                             :  Implementation of a 10+2 schooling structure
3.  Vocational Education                        :  Integration with academic streams at the secondary level


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims to increase the GER in higher education to at least 50% by 2035.  The NEP 2020 proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for school education, not 10+2.  The NEP 2020 advocates for the integration of vocational education with academic streams at the secondary level.  This question assesses understanding of the NEP 2020 and its key provisions in different areas of education.  The incorrect options provide plausible distractors based on possible misunderstandings of the policy's goals.  The question tests both factual recall and the ability to analyze the accuracy of information related to educational policy.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                  Ministry
1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                 :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0    :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
3. Intensified Mission Indradhanush       :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
4. National Nutrition Mission (NNM)       :   Ministry of Women and Child Development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a flagship health insurance scheme, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, focusing on nutrition and early childhood care, are implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush, a crucial immunization program, is also a Ministry of Health and Family Welfare initiative.  The National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyaan), aiming to improve nutritional status, is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Option (d) is incorrect because while the NNM is related to nutrition, it's not directly under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, missing correctly matched pairs. Option (c) accurately reflects the ministerial responsibilities for the listed schemes.  Understanding the organizational structure and the mandates of different ministries is crucial for UPSC preparation, as it demonstrates an understanding of policy implementation and governance in India.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Report/Initiative

2. UNICEF                                      :   Burden of disease attributable to unsafe WASH
3. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The "Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)" report was released by the World Health Organization (WHO), not UNICEF. UNICEF released the "Triple Threat Report" examining the combined impact of water, sanitation, and hygiene threats on children.  The "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" was published by the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), not UNICEF. Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched. This question tests the knowledge of different UN agencies and their respective publications.  Understanding the mandates and reports of various international organizations is critical for UPSC, showcasing awareness of global issues and their impact.


**3. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Role                                        Worker Category
1. Focuses on promotion of Maternal and Child Health :   Anganwadi Worker (AWW)
2. Providing early childhood care and development    :   Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)
3. Create awareness on factors that determine health status :   Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) primarily focus on early childhood care and development, encompassing nutritional and health aspects. Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) concentrate on the promotion of maternal and child health, including immunizations. Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) play a crucial role in creating awareness about health determinants and providing counseling.  Therefore, only the first pair is correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different community health workers within the Indian healthcare system, a crucial area for UPSC aspirants.  Understanding the interplay of various government schemes and the roles of different functionaries is vital for effective governance analysis.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                       Key Provision/Focus
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 :   Criminalizes marital rape
2.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (amended 2021) :  Allows termination up to 24 weeks under specific conditions.
3. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023                : Defines domestic violence comprehensively.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, primarily addresses domestic violence through civil remedies; it does not explicitly criminalize marital rape.  The MTP Act, as amended in 2021, allows for pregnancy termination up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances, including rape, incest, and risk to the woman's health. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, while addressing various aspects of criminal law, doesn't comprehensively redefine domestic violence in a manner significantly different from existing definitions. Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of legal frameworks related to women's rights and reproductive health in India.  Understanding the nuances of Indian laws and their impact on social issues is essential for UPSC preparation.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Objective
1. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)              :   Integrate credits from various educational paths.
2. National Research Foundation (NRF)          :   Promote multidisciplinary education
3. National Credit Framework (NCrF)             :   Digitize academic credit storage.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) aims to create a system for accumulating and transferring credits earned through various educational pathways, including higher education, vocational training, and skill development. The National Research Foundation (NRF) seeks to strengthen and expand research and innovation across various disciplines.

2. Global Gender Gap Index                       :   Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)               :   World Bank and WHO


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Economic Forum. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum. The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) is jointly released by the World Bank and WHO. Thus, only the third pair is correctly matched.  This question assesses knowledge of various global indices and their associated organizations.  Familiarity with these indices and their methodologies is important for UPSC, demonstrating an understanding of global development indicators.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Community                                 Category
1. Hakki Pikki Tribe                              :   Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG)
2. Bharia Tribe                                   :   Denotified Tribe (DNT)
3. Konda Reddis                                  :   Nomadic Tribe


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Hakki Pikki are a semi-nomadic tribe, but not specifically categorized as a PVTG. The Bharia are listed as a PVTG, not a DNT. The Konda Reddis are a tribal community often categorized as nomadic or semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers. Therefore, only the third pair is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge about different tribal communities in India and their categorization.  Understanding the diverse tribal populations and their socio-economic conditions is important for UPSC, demonstrating an understanding of India's social diversity and challenges.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                   Key Feature
1. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 :   Defines child labour comprehensively.
2. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015     :   Provides for adoption processes.
3. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Bans manual scavenging.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour Act of 2016 prohibits child labour but doesn't offer a comprehensive definition encompassing all forms of child exploitation. The Juvenile Justice Act of 2015 does deal with adoption procedures. The Manual Scavenging Act bans the practice of manual scavenging.  Therefore, only the second and third pairs are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of various acts related to child protection and social justice in India.  Understanding the legal framework for protecting vulnerable groups is crucial for UPSC.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization/Body                                  Mandate/Focus
1. National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) :   Monitors implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
2. UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) :   Protects the rights of children in India.
3. Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA)     :   Governs inter-country and intra-country adoptions.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

The NCPCR is an Indian body focused on child rights within India, not on the UNCRC. The UNCRC monitors the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child globally. CARA is the nodal body for adoption processes in India. Only the third pair accurately matches the organization with its mandate. This question assesses understanding of the roles and responsibilities of national and international organizations related to child rights.  Knowledge of such organizations and their functions is essential for UPSC.


**1. With reference to the legal framework concerning children in India, consider the following pairs:**

Act/Law                                     Provision/Feature
1. Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 :  Prohibits bonded labor
2. Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 : Protects children from sexual offences
3. Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 : Prohibits immoral trafficking and sex work
4. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023      : Raised the age of consent for a married woman to 18 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, primarily addresses immoral trafficking and sex work, not bonded labor.  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, focuses specifically on abolishing bonded labor, not on protecting children from sexual offenses. The POCSO Act, 2012, accurately protects children from sexual assault, sexual harassment, and pornography.  Finally, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, correctly raised the age of consent for sexual intercourse with a married woman from 15 to 18 years. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of precise understanding of the legislation's core provisions.


**2. With reference to the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following pairs:**

Offence Category                      Punishment Provision
1. Heinous Offences                     :  Maximum imprisonment up to three years
2. Serious Offences                     :  Imprisonment between three to seven years
3. Petty Offences                        :  Maximum imprisonment for seven years or more

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, categorizes offences differently.  Heinous offences under the Act carry the most severe punishments, including imprisonment for seven years or more.  Serious offences have a punishment range that includes imprisonment between three to seven years. Petty offences have a maximum punishment of imprisonment up to three years.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly link offence categories to their associated punishment provisions, highlighting a potential misunderstanding of the Act's sentencing structure.


**3. With reference to the Supreme Court judgment in Supriyo @ Supriya Chakraborty vs Union of India, consider the following pairs:**

Issue                                  Court Verdict
1. Right of transgender persons to marry :  Unanimously upheld the right to marry in heterosexual relations.
2. Right to enter a civil union for queer couples : Court prescribed a choice of civil unions for queer couples.
3. Interpretation of Special Marriage Act (SMA) : Court invalidated the SMA's gendered language.
4. Adoption rights for non-heterosexual couples : Upheld restrictions on adoption by non-heterosexual couples.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court in the Supriyo @ Supriya Chakraborty case correctly held that while there's no fundamental right to same-sex marriage, transgender persons in heterosexual relationships retain the right to marry under existing laws.  The Court did *not* prescribe civil unions as an alternative nor did it invalidate the Special Marriage Act's gendered language.  The Court also correctly upheld restrictions on adoption by non-heterosexual couples.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. The other options demonstrate a flawed understanding of the specifics of the Supreme Court's ruling.


**4.  With reference to the Prayatna Project, consider the following pairs:**

Project Feature                         Detail
1. Implementing Agency               : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2. Nodal Agency                         : National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC)
3. Target Beneficiaries                 :  Children with disabilities
4. Funding Source                       : Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prayatna project, a livelihood and enterprise training program, is correctly implemented by the NSDC under the approval of PMKVY.  The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment is not the implementing agency. The target beneficiaries are transgender people, not children with disabilities.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Other options contain incorrect pairings, illustrating a misunderstanding of the project's structure and focus.



**5. With reference to the  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan, consider the following pairs:**

Aspect                                  Detail
1.  Primary Goal                         :  Reduce stunting in districts with high malnutrition
2. Target Beneficiaries                 :  Only pregnant women
3. Key Implementation Mechanism       :  Strengthening Anganwadi Services
4.  Launched in                          :  2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The POSHAN Abhiyan's primary goal is to reduce stunting in high-malnutrition districts by improving utilization of key Anganwadi Services.  While pregnant women are beneficiaries, the scheme also targets mothers and children. The mission was launched in 2017, not 2023.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The other options include incorrect information regarding the scheme's objectives, beneficiaries, and launch year.


**6. With reference to the  'Triple Threat Report' by UNICEF, consider the following pairs:**

Indicator                                 Description
1.  Basic Water/Sanitation Access         :  Above 50% access
2. Child Mortality from Unsafe WASH     :  Lowest burden of deaths among children under 5
3. Climate and Environmental Hazards    :  Within bottom 25% of countries facing highest risk


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNICEF 'Triple Threat Report' defines a 'triple burden' based on less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation services, a high burden of deaths among children under 5 due to unsafe WASH, and being within the top 25% of countries facing highest climate and environmental risks.  Only pair 3 accurately reflects this. The other pairs misrepresent the report's criteria, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the report's key indicators.


**7. With reference to the  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, consider the following pairs:**

Indicator                                Value for India (2023)
1. GHI Score                             : 27.0
2. Undernourishment                     : 35.5%
3. Child Stunting                         : 16.6%
4. Child Mortality                       : 3.1%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2023 report for India shows a score of 28.7, not 27.0.  Undernourishment was 16.6%, not 35.5%, while child stunting was 35.5%, not 16.6%. Child mortality was accurately reported as 3.1%.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) reflect inaccuracies in the data, highlighting the importance of precise data recall in answering such questions.



**8. With reference to the  National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

Framework                                 Feature
1. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) :  Integrates school, higher, and vocational education credits.
2. National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)              :  Focuses solely on higher education credits.
3. National Curriculum Framework (NCF)/NSEQF                 :  Deals exclusively with vocational training credits.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF aims to integrate credits from school, higher education, and vocational/skill education.  The NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF are constituent frameworks within the larger NCrF, contributing to its comprehensive approach.  Only pair 1 correctly reflects this integrative function. The other options misrepresent the specific roles of the individual frameworks within the NCrF's overall structure.


**9. With reference to the  Anganwadi System in India, consider the following pairs:**

Worker Category                      Key Role/Responsibility
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)           :  Focuses primarily on maternal and child health.
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)    :  Provides early childhood care and development.
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) : Creates awareness on health determinants and counsels families.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While all three worker categories contribute to the Anganwadi system's goals, their primary roles differ. AWWs primarily focus on early childhood care and development, ANMs on maternal and child health, and ASHAs on community awareness and counseling. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The other options reflect a misunderstanding of the specific responsibilities of these frontline workers.


**10. With reference to the  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

Provision                                    Feature/Detail
1. Definition of Domestic Violence        : Excludes verbal and emotional abuse.
2. Coverage                               :  Includes only legally married women.
3. Reliefs Available                       : Can be sought only as a standalone legal action.
4.  Filing of Complaints                   : Can be filed only by the aggrieved woman herself.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, defines domestic violence comprehensively, including verbal, emotional, physical, sexual, and economic abuse. It covers a wide range of women in domestic relationships, including unmarried partners. It also allows for seeking reliefs alongside other legal proceedings.  Complaints can be filed by various entities including Protection Officers, etc.  Therefore, all pairs are incorrectly matched, highlighting a significant lack of familiarity with the Act's key provisions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                  Ministry
1. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0      :    Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP)    :    Ministry of Labour and Employment
3.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM)       :    Ministry of Women and Child Development
4.  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) is indeed a Central Sector scheme under the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan is correctly paired with the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme is also under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  Therefore, only the pairing of the National Nutrition Mission with the Ministry of Women and Child Development is correct.  The other options incorrectly attribute these schemes to different ministries.  Understanding the organizational structure of government ministries and their respective responsibilities is crucial for UPSC preparation.  This question tests the candidate's ability to accurately match schemes with their implementing ministries, highlighting the need for precise factual recall.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Key Provision
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :   Criminalizes marital rape
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (amended 2021) :  Allows abortion up to 24 weeks for all women
3.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021            :   Permits commercial surrogacy
4.  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 : Establishes Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations with fewer than 10 employees


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provides civil remedies but does not criminalize marital rape.  The MTP Act, as amended in 2021, allows abortion up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances, not for all women without exception. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act mandates ICCs in organizations with 10 or more employees; the Local Committee handles complaints from smaller organizations. Thus, only the pairing of the Sexual Harassment Act with the establishment of ICCs (though with a slight inaccuracy regarding the number of employees) is largely correct. This question tests the ability to recall specific provisions within various acts related to women's rights and welfare, demonstrating a detailed understanding of Indian legislation.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of NEP 2020                                     Specific Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education         :   Target of 100% by 2030
2. Undergraduate Degrees                                   :   Multiple exit options with certifications, diplomas, and degrees
3. Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs)   :   Establishment of a single national research foundation
4. National Educational Technology Forum (NETF)              :   Focus on promoting multilingualism and Indian languages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 targets a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, not 100% by 2030.  The NEP does indeed propose multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees.  The NEP advocates for the establishment of MERUs and the National Research Foundation (NRF) as separate entities, not as a single combined entity.  The promotion of multilingualism and Indian languages is a key feature of the NEP but is not solely the responsibility of the NETF. Therefore, only the description of undergraduate degree structures is accurately matched. The question assesses comprehension of the NEP's key features and requires precise recall of numerical targets and policy details.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Report/Index
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Global Gender Gap Index
2. World Economic Forum                         :   Global Food Policy Report
3. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  :   Gender Social Norms Index
4. World Health Organization (WHO)              :   Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IFPRI releases the Global Food Policy Report, not the World Economic Forum.  The World Economic Forum publishes the Global Gender Gap Report, not the Global Food Policy Report. The UNDP is indeed involved in the Gender Social Norms Index.  The WHO, along with the World Bank, publishes the Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index.  Hence, only the pairings of UNDP with the Gender Social Norms Index and WHO with the UHC Service Coverage Index are correct. This question tests knowledge of various international organizations and their respective publications, requiring accurate association of organizations with their reports and indices.


**5. With reference to the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), consider the following pairs:**

   ODF Status                                     Definition
1. ODF                                          :   Sustained ODF status with solid waste management
2. ODF Plus                                      :   No visible faeces in the environment; every household using safe disposal
3. ODF Plus Model Village                       :   Sustained ODF status with both solid and liquid waste management systems, visual cleanliness, and IEC messages
4.  ODF Plus Model Village                       :   Every household using safe technology option for disposal of faeces


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The definition of ODF is accurately described in option 3.  Option 1 incorrectly attributes the definition of ODF to ODF Plus. Option 2 attributes the definition of ODF Plus to ODF. Option 4 repeats a definition already given in option 2.  Therefore, only option 3 accurately defines ODF Plus Model Village. This question tests the understanding of the different levels of sanitation achievement under the Swachh Bharat Mission, demanding precise recall of terminology and definitions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                                   State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                                :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                                  :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                                  :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4.  Odisha                                       :  Houses the highest number of PVTGs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), but their distribution across states is not as given in options 1, 3 and 4. Bharia and Baiga are present in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and Kamar is present in both Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs, this statement is correct.  Therefore, only the pairings of Bharia PVTG with Chhattisgarh and Kamar PVTG with Madhya Pradesh are correct, given the overlapping presence of these groups across states.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of PVTGs, which requires precise recall of data.


**7.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Hydrogen                                    Characteristic
1. Blue Hydrogen                                     :   Uses renewable energy sources
2. Grey Hydrogen                                     :   Produces significant carbon dioxide emissions
3. Green Hydrogen                                    :   Produced through electrolysis of water
4. Brown Hydrogen                                    :   Derived from coal gasification


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Blue hydrogen uses natural gas with carbon capture and storage, not renewable energy sources. Grey hydrogen is produced from natural gas, leading to significant CO2 emissions. Green hydrogen is correctly matched with its production method. Brown hydrogen is indeed derived from coal gasification.  Therefore, only the pairings of grey, green, and brown hydrogen with their characteristics are correct. The question tests knowledge of different types of hydrogen production methods and their environmental impacts, requiring accurate understanding of technical details.




**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disability Category                                    Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 Provision
1. Intellectual Disability                             :   Free education for children between 6 and 18 years
2. Acid attack victims                               :   Reservation in government jobs (excluding police forces)
3.  Persons with Benchmark Disability                 :    Minimum 40% disability 
4.  Children with benchmark disability                :  Reservation in higher education institutions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, includes intellectual disability as a recognized category and mandates free education for children with benchmark disabilities between 6 and 18. Acid attack victims are included under the definition of disabilities and are entitled to reservation in government jobs (excluding police forces). The act defines "person with benchmark disability" as having at least 40% of a specified disability.  Children with benchmark disabilities are also entitled to reservation in higher education institutions.  Therefore, all the pairings are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, requiring detailed knowledge of its provisions.



**9. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

   Grade                                            Description
1. Daksh                                           :   Lowest grade attained in PGI 2.0
2. Utkarsh                                         :   Highest grade attained in PGI 2.0
3. Prachesta-2                                      :   Top grade attained in PGI 2.0 for States/UTs in 2021-22
4. Akanshi-3                                         :   Grade attained by Punjab and Chandigarh in PGI 2.0


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Daksh is the highest grade, not the lowest. Utkarsh is the second-highest grade, not the highest grade attained. Prachesta-2 is correctly identified as the top grade achieved by two States/UTs in PGI 2.0 for 2021-22. Akanshi-3 was the lowest grade attained by some states, not by Punjab and Chandigarh.  Therefore, only the pairing of Prachesta-2 with its description is correct.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the PGI grading system and requires accurate recall of specific details from the index.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Global Ranking                                 Institution
1. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 :   IIT Bombay ranked at 149
2. QS World University Ranking 2024               :   Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore topped the list of Indian Universities
3. CWUR Global 2000 Report 2023                  :   University of Oxford (UK) ranked as the best university in the world
4.  Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 :   Around 91 Indian Universities featured


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

IIT Bombay's ranking is from QS World University Rankings, not Times Higher Education. IISc Bangalore's ranking within the 201-250 bracket is from the Times Higher Education rankings, not QS.  The University of Oxford's top ranking is indeed from Times Higher Education. Approximately 91 Indian universities featured in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024.  Therefore, only the pairings of the CWUR report with Oxford's ranking and Times Higher Education with the number of Indian universities are correct. This question tests the knowledge of different global university ranking systems and requires accurate recall of specific institutional rankings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State with Highest PVTG Population
1. Bharia                                   :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar                                    :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga                                    :   Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  However, Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  The question attempts to mislead the candidate by presenting plausible distractors.  Option (a) is correct because Bharia is indeed a PVTG in Chhattisgarh. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly associate Kamar and Baiga with a specific state having the highest PVTG population, while the text indicates that Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs. The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern accurate information from distractors.  Understanding the distribution of PVTGs across different states is crucial for comprehending India's tribal demographics and the challenges associated with their welfare.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                 Ministry
1. Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2. Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3. National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) : Ministry of Rural Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission, announced in the Union Budget 2023-24, falls under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, not the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is correctly linked to the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is tasked with preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs, and it operates under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  This question tests factual knowledge regarding the governmental structure and responsibilities related to tribal and DNT welfare.  Understanding the roles of different ministries is important in analyzing policy implementation and effectiveness.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                  Specific Detail
1. Reservation in Government Jobs         :   Minimum 5% reservation in all Government jobs, including police forces
2. Free Education for Children with Benchmark Disabilities : Applicable to children aged 6 to 18 years, in any school of their choice
3. Recognition of Disabilities             :   Includes 21 types of disabilities, excluding acid attack victims

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs, excluding police forces. The provision for free education for children with benchmark disabilities (40% or more disability) between the ages of 6 and 18 years in a neighborhood or special school of their choice is accurate. However, the Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, and acid attack victims are explicitly included under the definition of benchmark disability. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct. This question tests detailed knowledge of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, highlighting the importance of understanding specific provisions and their nuances for effective policy analysis.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                   Specific Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Allows employment of individuals cleaning human waste with protective gear
2. National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system   : Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning and prevent deaths of sanitation workers
3. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                      : Provides concessional loans for purchasing sanitation-related equipment, but not for mechanized sanitation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, while banning manual scavenging, does include an exception for those using appropriate protective gear. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system correctly aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning and prevent deaths among sanitation workers.  Swachhta Udyami Yojana focuses on providing concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment, but it doesn't directly address mechanized sanitation systems.  The question tests the understanding of specific legal provisions and government schemes related to manual scavenging and sanitation.  It assesses the ability to differentiate between the scope and objectives of various initiatives.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Key Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                         :   Global Report on Food Crisis
2. UNDESA                                        :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3. WFP                                           :   India Ageing Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) releases the State of World Population report, not the Global Report on Food Crisis. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) correctly releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report.  The World Food Programme (WFP) does not release the India Ageing Report; that report is released by UNFPA in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS). The question tests knowledge of the reports and initiatives undertaken by various UN organizations.  It emphasizes the need to understand the specific mandates and activities of these agencies.  The accurate association of organizations with their respective reports is crucial for analyzing global development trends and policy responses.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                      Specific Detail
1.  Curriculum Framework                     :  Based on a 5+3+3+4 structure, replacing the existing 4-stage structure
2. Board Examinations                       :  Students are allowed to take board exams only once per year
3.  Multilingualism and Indian Languages   :  Students must be proficient in at least four Indian languages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE indeed proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.  However, the NCF-SE allows students to take board exams on at least two occasions during a school year, not just once.  The NCF-SE advocates for proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages, not four.  This question assesses knowledge of the key features of the NCF-SE, focusing on the details of the curriculum structure, examination system, and language policy.  Understanding these details is crucial for evaluating the impact of the NCF-SE on the Indian education system.  The question highlights the importance of careful reading and accurate recall of information.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative                       Specific Aim/Feature
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                   : Primarily focuses on tertiary level healthcare interventions
2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) : Aims to restrict access to telemedicine to urban areas
3.  National Health Policy 2017              : Does not aim to achieve Universal Health Coverage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to address health holistically at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, not just tertiary. The ABDM aims to improve equitable access to quality healthcare through technologies like telemedicine and national portability of health services, making it accessible across both urban and rural areas.  The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims to achieve Universal Health Coverage. All three statements are factually incorrect, making (a) the correct option. This question tests understanding of key health initiatives in India, focusing on their objectives and scope.  It emphasizes the importance of accurate knowledge of government policies and programs related to healthcare delivery. The question assesses the ability to identify inaccuracies and misconceptions.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                    Specific Mandate/Function
1.  GANHRI                                        :  Accredits National Human Rights Institutions based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
2.  UNPFII                                         :  Is solely responsible for dealing with Indigenous Peoples’ issues within the UN system
3.  UNCRC                                          : Monitors implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by its member states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

GANHRI accredits National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Paris Principles, not the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UNPFII is one of three UN bodies mandated to deal with Indigenous Peoples’ issues, not the sole body. The UNCRC accurately monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by its state parties.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge about the functions and mandates of international organizations working on human rights and Indigenous issues.  It highlights the importance of understanding the specific frameworks and principles guiding their work.  Accurate association of organizations with their roles is crucial for effective analysis of international cooperation and human rights advocacy.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Surrogacy                           Characteristic
1. Altruistic Surrogacy                       : Involves monetary compensation exceeding basic medical expenses
2. Commercial Surrogacy                     : Prohibited under the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
3. Gestational Surrogacy                     : The surrogate mother is the biological mother of the child


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Altruistic surrogacy, by definition, does not involve monetary compensation beyond basic medical expenses. Commercial surrogacy is indeed prohibited under the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021. In gestational surrogacy, the surrogate mother is not genetically related to the child; the embryo is implanted from the intended parents.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  This question tests the understanding of different types of surrogacy and their legal status in India.  It highlights the importance of distinguishing between altruistic and commercial surrogacy and understanding the implications of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021.  The question assesses the ability to analyze definitions and legal frameworks.



**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legislation                                  Key Provision
1.  POCSO Act, 2012                             : Sets the age of consent for sexual activity at 16 years
2.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023   : Retains the marital rape exception for women under 18 years
3.  Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956     : Primarily addresses child trafficking for labour and begging


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The POCSO Act, 2012, sets the age of consent at 18 years, not 16. The BNS, 2023, does retain the marital rape exception, raising the age of consent for a married woman from 15 to 18 years but still retaining the exception. The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, primarily addresses the prevention of immoral trafficking, including prostitution, not specifically child trafficking for labour and begging. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.  This question tests knowledge of key legislation related to child protection and sexual offences in India. It highlights the importance of understanding the specific provisions and limitations of these laws.  The question assesses the ability to analyze legal frameworks and identify factual inaccuracies.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/Union Territory
1. Bharia PVTG                            :   Odisha
2. Kamar PVTG                             :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                              :   Chhattisgarh
4. Hakki Pikki Tribe                       :   Karnataka
5. Konda Reddi Tribe                      :   Andhra Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Option 1 is incorrect as Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs, but Bharia is not exclusively found there. Option 2 is partially correct, as Kamar is a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh, but Hakki Pikki are indeed semi-nomadic from Karnataka. Option 3 is correct because the Baiga tribe is a PVTG in Chhattisgarh, and the Hakki Pikki are a semi-nomadic tribe in Karnataka. Option 4 is partially correct as Hakki Pikki is from Karnataka, but Konda Reddi are not exclusively found in Andhra Pradesh, though they are present there.  The question tests factual recall of tribal groups and their locations, highlighting the complexities of tribal distribution across states.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings (like Bharia with Odisha) ensures that superficial knowledge is insufficient to answer the question correctly.  Understanding the precise geographical distribution of these tribal groups is crucial for correct matching.


**2. With reference to De-notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Act                            Key Feature
1. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871              :   Repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
2. Renke Commission, 2008                :   Estimated 15 crore Indians belonging to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes
3. Idate Commission Report                 :   Recommended a permanent commission for DNTs
4. National Commission for DNTs           :   Prepared a state-wise list of DNT castes
5. SEED Scheme                             :   Provides health insurance to families

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. The Renke Commission of 2008 provided the estimation mentioned. The Idate Commission recommended the establishment of a permanent commission for DNTs.  The National Commission for DNTs was tasked with creating a state-wise list. Finally, the SEED (Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities) includes health insurance provisions for families. This question tests factual recall and understanding of various commissions, acts, and schemes related to the welfare of DNTs.  The comprehensive nature of the question, covering multiple aspects of DNT policies, makes it challenging.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes option (d) the only viable choice, demanding complete knowledge of the subject matter.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                 Detail

2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions :   Not less than 5% reservation
3. Recognition of Disabilities             :  Includes intellectual disability and acid attack victims
4. Free Education                          :   For children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18
5.  Chief Commissioner for PwD Office    :  Under Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Act mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs and not less than 5% in higher education institutions for persons with disabilities.  It explicitly recognizes intellectual disability and acid attack victims among the 21 types of disabilities.  Free education is guaranteed for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18. The office of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities operates under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  This question tests knowledge of the specific provisions and details of the RPwD Act, 2016.  The inclusion of all correct pairs acts as a distractor, requiring comprehensive knowledge to identify the correct answer.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the Act's key features.

(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. The PEMSR Act explicitly prohibits manual scavenging. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana offers concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices. The SRMS scheme focuses on rehabilitating manual scavengers into alternative professions. Finally, the NAMASTE scheme is indeed a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). This question assesses knowledge of various acts, schemes, and policies related to manual scavenging and its eradication.  The inclusion of all correct pairs acts as a distractor, requiring thorough knowledge of the subject to identify the correct answer.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of government initiatives.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                      Detail

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. NEP 2020 targets a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035.  Undergraduate degrees are designed with a 3 or 4-year duration, incorporating multiple exit options. The ABC system is intended to digitally store academic credits earned by students. The NRF is established to catalyze and expand research and innovation.  Finally, the NETF aims to serve as a platform for the exchange of ideas on using technology in education. This question tests knowledge of the NEP 2020's key features and their details.  The inclusion of all correct pairs acts as a distractor, requiring in-depth knowledge of the policy to select the correct answer. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the policy's various components.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Report/Index
1. UNFPA                                      : Global Food Policy Report 2023
2. UNDESA                                     : Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3. World Economic Forum                       : Global Gender Gap Index 2023
4. WHO and World Bank                          : UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)
5. IFPRI                                       : India Ageing Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  UNDESA releases the SDG Progress Report. The World Economic Forum publishes the Global Gender Gap Index. WHO and the World Bank jointly release the UHC Service Coverage Index. However, pair 1 is incorrect; UNFPA does not release the Global Food Policy Report (IFPRI does). Pair 5 is also incorrect; UNFPA, in collaboration with IIPS, releases the India Ageing Report, not IFPRI. This question tests knowledge of various international organizations and the reports/indices they publish.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings (like UNFPA with the food policy report) increases the question's difficulty.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to link organizations with their publications.


**7. With reference to  the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                    Value for India

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  The GHI 2023 reported Child Stunting in India as 35.5%, Child Mortality as 3.1%, and the overall GHI score as 28.7.  However, the values for Undernourishment and Child Wasting are switched in options 1 and 3.  Undernourishment was 16.6%, and Child Wasting was 18.7%. This question tests the ability to recall specific data from the GHI report.  The deliberate mismatching of values for Undernourishment and Child Wasting increases the difficulty level.  The question assesses factual recall and attention to detail.


**1. With reference to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), consider the following pairs:**

   Survey Year                                 Key Finding
1. NFHS-5 (2019-2021)                     :  Percentage of spousal abuse was highest in Karnataka
2. NFHS-4 (2015-2016)                     : Total Fertility Rate was 2.2
3. NFHS-6 (2022-2023)                     :  Data on spousal violence in Telangana was released

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NFHS-5 (2019-2021) data indeed showed Karnataka had a higher percentage of spousal abuse among the states mentioned in the provided text.  NFHS-4 (2015-2016) accurately reported a Total Fertility Rate of 2.2.  However, the statement regarding NFHS-6 and Telangana is incorrect. While NFHS-6 did release data, the provided text doesn't specify that the data included information specifically highlighting Telangana's spousal violence statistics as the highest or a particular statistic related to this.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of NFHS-6 as a distractor tests the candidate's understanding of the specific data points released in each survey.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to discern correct information from plausible but ultimately incorrect assertions.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                      Key Feature
1. GHI 2023                               : India ranked 111th among 125 countries
2. GHI 2015                               :  India's GHI score was 29.2
3. GHI Methodology                         : Uses data solely from the World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2023 report correctly placed India at 111th out of 125 countries. The GHI 2015 score for India was also accurately stated as 29.2. However, the third pair is incorrect. While the GHI does utilize data from various sources, it does not rely solely on the World Bank.  The GHI methodology incorporates data from multiple reputable organizations and sources to create a comprehensive index. The inclusion of a false statement about the data sources tests the candidate's knowledge of the index's creation and its reliance on a variety of data.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the GHI's methodology.


**3. Consider the following pairs related to the National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

   Position                                 Person/Body
1. President, NRF Governing Board       :  Prime Minister of India
2. Ex-officio Member, NRF Governing Board :  Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India
3. Administrative Department of NRF     :  Ministry of Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prime Minister of India is indeed the ex-officio President of the NRF Governing Board, as per the Act. The Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India is also correctly listed as an ex-officio member of the Governing Board.  However, the Ministry of Education is not the administrative department for the NRF; it is the Department of Science and Technology (DST).  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the organizational structure and administrative details of the NRF as specified by the Act. The incorrect pairing serves as a distractor, testing detailed understanding.


**4. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                   Definition
1. Manual Scavenger                     :  Any person employed to handle decomposed human waste with protective gear
2. Insanitary Latrine                     :  A latrine that is not hygienically designed and maintained
3. Rehabilitation Measures under PEMSR  :  Solely focuses on providing financial assistance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The definition of an insanitary latrine in pair 2 is accurate as per the act's intent.  Pair 1 is incorrect because it describes a person using protective gear, which is an exception, not the definition, of a manual scavenger under PEMSR. Pair 3 is also incorrect; rehabilitation under PEMSR includes various measures beyond financial aid, such as training and job placement.  The question assesses understanding of the PEMSR act's key definitions and its scope of rehabilitation measures.  Incorrect options test knowledge of specific details and nuances within the act.


**5. Consider the following pairs related to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

   Rule/Provision                                  Amendment
1. Use of Donor Gametes                       : Allowed only if at least one gamete is from the intending couple
2. Surrogacy for Single Women                 :  Prohibited entirely
3. Establishment of National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) :  Mandated by the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The amendment to the rules regarding donor gametes (pair 1) is correctly described. The NARTSB's establishment (pair 3) is correctly linked to the 2021 Act.  However, pair 2 is incorrect.  The rules do not entirely prohibit surrogacy for single women; they specify conditions under which it is allowed.  The question tests understanding of specific amendments within the surrogacy regulations.  The incorrect option serves as a crucial distractor, requiring careful reading of the regulations.


**6. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Worker Category                             Key Feature
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)                   :  Receives only a fixed monthly honorarium
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)           :  Works under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) :  Primarily focuses on curative care and supplies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the statement regarding ANMs working under the ICDS scheme is incorrect.  While ANMs often collaborate with Anganwadi workers, their primary employment is under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) or Urban Health Mission. AWWs receive both a fixed honorarium and performance-linked incentives, making statement 1 false. ASHAs focus on preventive healthcare and community awareness, not curative care, making statement 3 false. The question tests knowledge of the roles and functions of different community health workers and their respective schemes, requiring detailed knowledge beyond basic awareness.  The incorrect options are designed to confuse candidates who have only a surface-level understanding.


**7.  Consider the following pairs related to the  United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC):**

   Topic                                       Key Feature
1.  UNCRC Ratification                       : Ratified by 196 countries, including India
2.  UNCRC Monitoring Body                   :  A body of 18 independent experts
3.  UNCRC's focus on children's environment : UNCRC has never issued guidance on children's right to a healthy environment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNCRC has indeed been ratified by 196 countries, including India, and is monitored by a body of 18 independent experts.  However, the statement that the UNCRC has never issued guidance on children's right to a healthy environment is false.  The UNCRC has explicitly addressed this issue in its guidance documents.  This question tests specific knowledge about the UNCRC's ratification status, monitoring mechanisms, and its evolving focus on environmental issues. The inclusion of a false statement related to UNCRC’s stance on environmental rights acts as a significant distractor, requiring candidates to have in-depth knowledge of the convention's evolving interpretations.


**8. With reference to the  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Area                                 Target/Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education : Aim to reach 50% by 2035
2.  Undergraduate Degree Duration             :  Only 4-year duration
3. Establishment of National Research Foundation (NRF) :  To catalyze research and innovation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 correctly aims to increase the GER in higher education to 50% by 2035, and it does establish the NRF to promote research.  However, the statement about undergraduate degrees having only a 4-year duration is incorrect.  The NEP allows for both 3-year and 4-year undergraduate programs, with multiple exit options. This question tests detailed understanding of the NEP 2020 provisions. The incorrect option related to undergraduate degree duration acts as a critical distractor, requiring candidates to have precise knowledge of the policy's flexibility.


**9. Consider the following pairs related to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs):**

   Regulation/Provision                           Feature
1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 :  Supersedes the 2019 regulations
2. Eligibility for DTBU status under 2023 Regulations : Institutions must be at least 20 years old
3.  NCERT's DTBU Status                        : Allows it to offer its own graduate and postgraduate degrees


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 DTBU regulations correctly supersede the 2019 regulations, and NCERT's DTBU status grants it the authority to offer its own degrees. However, the statement about the age requirement for DTBU status is incorrect. The 2023 regulations removed the 20-year age restriction.  This question tests detailed knowledge of the regulations governing DTBUs.  The incorrect option, concerning the age limit, acts as a significant distractor, requiring precise understanding of the regulatory changes.



**10. With reference to the  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), consider the following pairs:**

   GANHRI Action                                   Reason
1. Deferred Accreditation of NHRC, India       :  Concerns about political interference in appointments
2. GANHRI's Headquarter Location               : Geneva, Switzerland
3. GANHRI's Accreditation Process              :  Accreditation is done every ten years



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GANHRI did defer the accreditation of the NHRC due to concerns including political interference.  GANHRI's headquarters are correctly located in Geneva, Switzerland. However, GANHRI's accreditation process involves a review every five years, not ten. This question assesses knowledge of GANHRI's functions and its interaction with national human rights commissions. The incorrect option regarding the frequency of accreditation acts as a key distractor, testing detailed knowledge of the organization's procedures.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Headquarters
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) : Geneva, Switzerland
2. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Washington, D.C., USA
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA.  The UNHCR's headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland. The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.  Option (d) is correct because only the statement regarding GANHRI's location is accurate. The other pairings incorrectly associate IFPRI and UNHCR with the wrong headquarters cities.  Understanding the locations of key international organizations is crucial for comprehending their global reach and influence, a common theme in UPSC examinations.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of these organizations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                             Publisher(s)
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                         :  World Economic Forum
2. Global Gender Gap Index                           : Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
3. Gender Social Norms Index                         : United Nations Development Programme
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is jointly published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hungerhilfe. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum. The Gender Social Norms Index is indeed published by the United Nations Development Programme. Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various indices related to social development and their respective publishers.  The inclusion of the World Economic Forum as a distractor in pair 1 effectively tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between various indices and their sources.  Knowledge of these organizations and their publications is important for understanding global development trends and policy discussions.


**3. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Worker Category                             Key Role
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)                 :  Focuses primarily on promotion of maternal and child health
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)           :  Provides early childhood care and development
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) :  Creates awareness on factors that determine health status
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) are primarily responsible for providing early childhood care and development services. Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) focus on the promotion of maternal and child health, including immunizations. Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) play a crucial role in creating awareness about factors influencing health status and counseling families. Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles of various community health workers within the Indian healthcare system.  The incorrect placement of ANM and AWW roles in options (a), (b), and (d) acts as effective distractors, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge of these roles.


**4. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

   Statement                                    Status
1.  It was launched in 2017.                    :   Incorrect
2.  Its objective is to reduce stunting.          :   Correct
3.  It aims to ensure holistic development.      :   Correct
Which of the statements given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) was indeed launched in 2018, not 2017.  A core objective of the mission is to reduce stunting among children, and it aims for holistic development encompassing nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the POSHAN Abhiyan's key features and objectives.  The inclusion of the incorrect launch year in statement 1 acts as a distractor, emphasizing the need for precise factual recall.  Knowledge of government schemes and their goals is crucial for answering UPSC questions on social welfare and development.


**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                          Prominent Feature
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Bans manual scavenging
2.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA) 2005 : Defines domestic violence to include economic abuse
3.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 : Mandates 5% reservation in all government jobs
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly bans the practice of manual scavenging. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, comprehensively defines domestic violence, including economic abuse.  However, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of key legislation related to social justice and protection of vulnerable groups.  The incorrect reservation percentage in pair 3 serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the act's provisions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                         Key Finding/Focus
1.  India Ageing Report 2023                     :  India's population surpassing China's by mid-2023
2.  Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report  :  75% of the world’s refugees are hosted by Low- and middle-income countries
3.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition : Progress on more than 50% of SDG targets is weak
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The India Ageing Report 2023, released by UNFPA, highlighted India's population surpassing China's by mid-2023.  The UNHCR's "Global Trends" report indicated that 76%, not 75%, of the world's refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries. The UNDESA's SDG Progress Report 2023 accurately stated that progress on over 50% of SDG targets is weak.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key reports from international organizations and their significant findings.  The slight alteration in the percentage in pair 2 and the use of other reports as distractors create a challenging and discerning question.


**7. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                                    Target/Goal
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education :  At least 50% by 2035
2.  Multiple exit options in Undergraduate degrees  :  To allow students to earn a certification after the first year
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)             :  To catalyze research and innovation across all disciplines
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 indeed aims for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035.  The policy introduces multiple exit options in undergraduate programs, allowing students to earn certifications, diplomas, or degrees after completing different stages of study. The NEP also establishes the National Research Foundation (NRF) to boost research and innovation.  All three pairs are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the NEP 2020's key features and their intended goals.  The combination of various policy features and their targets makes this question challenging, demanding a comprehensive understanding of the NEP.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Body                                     Mandate/Function
1.  National Medical Commission (NMC)                   :  Oversees medical education and practice in India
2.  National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) :  Regulates dental education and profession
3.  National Dental Commission (NDC)                    : Frames policies and regulates standards for nursing and midwifery education
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Medical Commission (NMC) is indeed responsible for overseeing medical education and practice in India.  However, the National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) regulates nursing and midwifery education, while the National Dental Commission (NDC) regulates dental education and the profession.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the mandates of various regulatory bodies in the healthcare sector. The incorrect assignment of functions in pairs 2 and 3 makes it a difficult question, requiring precise knowledge of each body's role.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                         Specific Focus/Objective
1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                  :  Improve equitable access to quality healthcare through technology
2.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush        :  Reduce stunting among children in high-burden districts
3.  Saksham Anganwadis                       :  Strengthen and upgrade Anganwadi Centres across India
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on providing health insurance and access to healthcare services, not specifically on technological improvements.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush aims to increase immunization coverage, not directly address stunting. Saksham Anganwadis is indeed focused on strengthening and upgrading Anganwadi Centers across the country. Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's understanding of various government schemes and their specific aims.  The incorrect pairings in options (a), (b), and (c) act as effective distractors, requiring detailed knowledge of each initiative's goals.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Convention                       Core Principle/Objective
1.  1951 Refugee Convention                 :  To save lives, protect rights, and build a better future for people forced to flee their homes
2.  POSHAN Abhiyan                          :  To ensure sexual and reproductive rights and choices for all
3.  ICPD Programme of Action (1994)         :  To reduce stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence among children
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 1951 Refugee Convention's core objective is indeed to protect refugees and build a better future for them. POSHAN Abhiyan focuses on improving nutrition, not sexual and reproductive rights, which is the UNFPA's mandate. The 1994 ICPD Programme of Action aims for universal access to reproductive health services, not specifically to reduce malnutrition indicators.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the core objectives of various international programs and conventions. The incorrect associations in pairs 2 and 3 serve as strong distractors, necessitating precise knowledge of these programs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Headquarters Location
1. IFPRI                                          :   Rome, Italy
2. UNHCR                                         :   Geneva, Switzerland
3. GANHRI                                        :   Washington, D.C., USA
4. UNPFII                                        :   New York, USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA, not Rome, Italy.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is correctly matched with Geneva, Switzerland as its headquarters. The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is also correctly located in Geneva, Switzerland, not Washington D.C. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is correctly located in New York, USA. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair involving IFPRI's headquarters.  This question tests factual recall of the headquarters locations of various international organizations, a common theme in UPSC examinations.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, like Washington D.C. for GANHRI, increases the difficulty level and assesses the candidate's ability to accurately recall specific details.


**2. With reference to the mandates of various UN bodies, consider the following pairs:**

   UN Body                                          Mandate Focus
1.  UNHCR                                          :   Combating hunger and providing food assistance
2.  UNDESA                                          :   Monitoring implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development
3.  UNCPD                                         :   Addressing issues related to economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights of indigenous peoples
4. UNCRC                                          :   Saving lives, protecting rights, and building a better future for forcibly displaced people
5.  WFP                                             :  Monitoring the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR's mandate focuses on forcibly displaced people, aligning with option 4. The WFP's primary goal is combating hunger and providing food aid, making option 5 correct.  Option 1 incorrectly attributes the WFP's mandate to the UNHCR. Option 2 misattributes the UNCPD's mandate to UNDESA; UNDESA has a broader mandate related to sustainable development goals. Option 3 incorrectly assigns the UNPFII's mandate to the UNCPD.  The question tests the understanding of the specific mandates of different UN bodies, a crucial aspect for UPSC aspirants. The inclusion of incorrect pairs with plausible distractors makes it a challenging question, demanding precise knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                           Releasing Organization
1. Global Food Policy Report 2023                :   UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
2. Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report :   International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
3. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023 :   United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
4. State of World Population Report 2023          :   United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only the fourth pair is correctly matched. The State of World Population Report 2023 is indeed released by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The Global Food Policy Report 2023 is released by IFPRI, not UNDESA.  The "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" is published by UNHCR, not IFPRI. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023 is released by UNDESA, not UNHCR. This question tests the knowledge of specific reports and their releasing organizations, a common theme in UPSC exams. The incorrect options provide plausible distractors, making the question challenging and requiring precise factual recall.


**4. With reference to the initiatives for transgender persons in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Implementing Ministry
1. Prayatna Project                               :   Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD)
2. SMILE Scheme                                  :   Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE)
3. National Portal for Transgender Persons       :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment (MoSJE)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The SMILE scheme and the National Portal for Transgender Persons are correctly linked to their respective ministries.  The Prayatna Project, however, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), not the MoWCD.  This question tests knowledge of government schemes and their implementing ministries.  The inclusion of a plausible distractor (Prayatna Project) increases the difficulty and tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the subject.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Feature
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :   Criminalizes marital rape
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021 :   Allows abortion up to 24 weeks in specific cases
3.  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013 :   Mandates Internal Complaints Committees in organizations with 10 or more employees


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The second and third pairs are correctly matched. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, does allow abortion up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances. The POSH Act, 2013, mandates the establishment of ICCs in workplaces with 10 or more employees. However, the PWDVA, 2005, provides civil remedies for domestic violence, not criminalizing marital rape.  This question tests the understanding of specific legislation concerning women's rights in India.  The incorrect option (1) serves as a significant distractor, requiring careful analysis of the acts' provisions.


**6. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   NEP 2020 Feature                              Implementation Detail
1.  5+3+3+4 curricular structure                 :   Applies only to higher education
2.  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)               :   Digitally stores academic credits earned from various institutions
3.  National Credit Framework (NCF)              :   Seamlessly integrates credits from school, higher education, and vocational education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The ABC system indeed digitally stores academic credits, and the NCF aims to integrate credits across different educational levels. However, the 5+3+3+4 curricular structure applies to school education, not solely higher education, making option 1 incorrect.  The question assesses understanding of the NEP 2020's key features and their implementation details.  The carefully chosen distractor (option 1) enhances the question's difficulty.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Primary Mandate
1.  GANHRI                                        :   Accreditation of National Human Rights Institutions
2.  UNPFII                                         :   Addressing issues related to forced displacement
3.  CARA                                           :   Governing inter-country and intra-country adoptions
4.  NHRC                                          :   Protecting and promoting human rights in India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

GANHRI's primary role is the accreditation of NHRIs, CARA governs adoptions, and the NHRC protects human rights within India.  The UNPFII focuses on indigenous issues, not forced displacement; that is primarily the UNHCR's mandate. This question tests the knowledge of various organizations and their functions, a common theme in UPSC exams.  The inclusion of an incorrect pair with a closely related organization (UNPFII and UNHCR) makes the question challenging and tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding organizations.


**8. With reference to the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), consider the following pairs:**

   ODF Status Level                            Definition Characteristic
1. ODF                                          :   All households using safe sanitation technologies
2. ODF Plus                                     :   Sustained ODF status with solid waste management systems in place
3. ODF Plus Model Village                        :   Sustained ODF status with both solid and liquid waste management systems and visual cleanliness


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately describe the different levels of ODF status under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen).  ODF signifies the complete absence of open defecation. ODF Plus builds upon this by including solid waste management, and the ODF Plus Model Village adds liquid waste management and visual cleanliness.  This question assesses the understanding of the Swachh Bharat Mission's goals and its various stages.  The straightforward nature of the correct options might seem easy, but the detailed descriptions make it a moderately difficult question, requiring the candidate to distinguish between subtle differences in the definitions.  The options are designed to ensure that a candidate has a clear understanding of the different levels of ODF status.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Community                     State/Region
1. Bharia PVTG                         :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                          :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga Tribe                           :   Odisha
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all recognized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  However, their distribution across states is not uniformly represented in all options. The Bharia and Baiga tribes are indeed found in Chhattisgarh, and the Baiga tribe is also present in Madhya Pradesh.  Option (a) correctly identifies the Bharia PVTG as being present in Chhattisgarh.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly pair these tribes with states where their presence is either less significant or nonexistent according to available data.  The question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of specific PVTGs in India, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge in understanding the complexities of tribal populations and their distribution.  Understanding the distribution of these groups is crucial for targeted welfare programs and policy implementation.  Incorrect options serve as effective distractors, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge rather than general understanding of PVTG distribution.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic                     Description
1. First recognized                   :   2006 as PVTGs
2. Number of PVTGs                   :   75 spread over 18 states and 1 UT
3. Highest number of PVTGs           :   Madhya Pradesh
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) and later renamed in 2006.  There are currently 75 PVTGs spread across 18 states and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  While Madhya Pradesh has a large ST population, Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs. Option (b) correctly matches the year of renaming and the total number of PVTGs. Option (a) is partially correct, but incomplete. Option (c) and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the state with the highest number of PVTGs.  The question assesses factual recall of key characteristics and data related to PVTGs, testing the candidate's knowledge of the specific criteria and the overall count of these groups.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as Madhya Pradesh having the highest number of PVTGs (which is true for the overall ST population but false for PVTGs), increases the difficulty level and necessitates precise knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                              Provision/Feature
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Punishment with imprisonment upto 5 years
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016                      :   Reservation for PwDs in Police forces
3.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021                               :   Allows commercial surrogacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment, not 5. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, specifically excludes police forces from the reservation mandate. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of specific legal provisions concerning social welfare and protection of vulnerable groups.  The incorrect options present plausible but ultimately inaccurate details, requiring precise knowledge of the acts' content rather than general familiarity with their aims. This highlights the importance of detailed study of relevant legislation for accurate responses.


**4. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of NEP                                      Target/Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education         :   100% by 2030
2. Multiple exit options in Undergraduate degrees          :   Certification after first year, diploma after second year
3. National Research Foundation (NRF)                       :   To replace the SERB

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, not 100% by 2030.  The NEP does indeed propose multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees, including certifications and diplomas at different stages. The National Research Foundation (NRF) was established to subsume and replace the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB). Option (c) accurately reflects the multiple exit options and the role of NRF. The other options contain incorrect targets or misinterpretations of NEP provisions. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the NEP's key features and targets, requiring detailed knowledge of the policy's provisions.  The incorrect options use plausible but ultimately inaccurate details, emphasizing the importance of specific knowledge over general understanding.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Report/Initiative
1.  UNFPA                                         :   Global Food Policy Report 2023
2.  UNDESA                                        :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3.  IFPRI                                          :    India Ageing Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA releases the State of World Population report, not the Global Food Policy Report. The UNDESA is indeed responsible for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report. The IFPRI publishes the Global Food Policy Report, not the India Ageing Report. Only the second pair is correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of international organizations and their key publications and initiatives.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings serves as a strong distractor, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of each organization's work.  The incorrect options highlight the need to carefully distinguish between similar-sounding reports and organizations.


**6. With reference to Government Initiatives for Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                                  Ministry/Department
1.  Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission     :   Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme    :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3.  SMILE Scheme                                     :   Ministry of Labour and Employment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission falls under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, not the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme is indeed run by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The SMILE scheme is also under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Only the third pair is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of government schemes related to tribal welfare and their respective administrative ministries.  The incorrect pairings use plausible but inaccurate ministry attributions, requiring precise knowledge of the administrative structure of these schemes.  The use of distractors underscores the necessity of detailed understanding of governmental organization.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                 Key Provision/Feature
1.  Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 :   Prohibits discrimination in employment only
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :   Defines a child as a person below 16 years of age
3.  POCSO Act, 2012                                         :   Sets the age of consent at 16 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, prohibits discrimination across various sectors, including employment, education, healthcare, etc., not just employment. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a child as a person below 18 years of age. The POCSO Act, 2012, sets the age of consent at 18 years.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific legal provisions related to the rights and protection of vulnerable groups.  The use of incorrect provisions in the options serves as a significant distractor, requiring precise understanding of the legal frameworks.  The incorrect options emphasize the importance of detailed legal knowledge for a correct answer.


**8. With reference to the ODF and ODF Plus initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Status/Designation                        Characteristic
1.  ODF Village                               :   Sustained ODF status plus solid waste management
2.  ODF Plus Model Village                  :   Arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management
3.  ODF Plus Village                           :   Visual cleanliness including no plastic waste in public places


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

An ODF village is defined by the absence of open defecation and the use of safe sanitation technologies. An ODF Plus village goes beyond this, including either solid or liquid waste management. An ODF Plus Model Village meets stricter criteria, including arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management and visual cleanliness.  The first pair is incorrect because ODF villages don't necessarily include solid waste management. The third pair is also incorrect because visual cleanliness is a requirement of the ODF Plus Model Village, not just ODF Plus villages. Only the second and third pairs are correctly matched. The question assesses understanding of the different levels and requirements of the ODF and ODF Plus sanitation programs.  The incorrect options include plausible but inaccurate characteristics, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the program's definitions and levels.  The distractors underscore the importance of careful reading and understanding of the program's nuances.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                    State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                             :  Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                              :  Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                               :  Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  However, the question plays on the fact that some PVTGs are spread across multiple states.  The Bharia and Baiga tribes are found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Kamar tribe is also present in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are partially correct. Option (a) is incorrect because only pair 1 is not correctly matched. Option (c) is incorrect because only pair 3 is not correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect as only two pairs are partially correct.  The inclusion of Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a location for Baiga PVTG is a deliberate distractor, as the majority of Baiga population resides in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. This question tests factual recall and the ability to discern partially correct information from entirely incorrect information.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs        :    Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology    :    Use of advanced farming techniques
2. Low level of literacy                   :    High adult literacy rates
3. Economic backwardness                 :    High per capita income
4. Declining or stagnant population       :    Rapid population growth

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs are the opposite of what is presented in the pairs.  PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural technology (not advanced techniques), low literacy rates (not high), economic backwardness (not high per capita income), and a declining or stagnant population (not rapid growth).  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the defining characteristics of PVTGs.  The options are designed to be plausible distractors, testing the candidate's ability to identify completely incorrect statements.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheduled Tribes (ST) related fact       :   State/UT
1. Highest ST population in absolute numbers:   Mizoram
2. Highest percentage of ST population      :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Highest number of PVTGs                 :    Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of STs in absolute terms, Mizoram boasts the highest percentage of its population belonging to Scheduled Tribes. Odisha, on the other hand, houses the highest number of PVTGs.  Option (a) is incorrect because the highest ST population in absolute numbers is in Madhya Pradesh, not Mizoram. Option (b) is incorrect because only pair 3 is correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because only one pair is correctly matched. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the distribution of STs and PVTGs across Indian states.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the nuances in the distribution of tribal populations.



**4. With reference to De-notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

    Statement                               :     Fact
1. All nomadic tribes are DNTs           :     True
2. All DNTs are nomadic tribes           :     True
3. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, is still in force:   False

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correctly matched.  While all DNTs are nomadic tribes, not all nomadic tribes are DNTs. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 has been repealed. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes, and the historical context of the Criminal Tribes Act. The distractors aim to confuse candidates who may have a partial understanding of the topic.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Initiative for DNTs        :     Ministry/Department
1.  National Commission for DNTs          :    Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2. Dr. Ambedkar Scholarship for DNTs    :    Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3. Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED): Ministry of Minority Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship and SEED schemes are under different ministries. This question tests factual recall of government initiatives and the ministries responsible for their implementation.  The incorrect options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the specific ministries involved in tribal and social welfare programs.


**6. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision                                 :    Detail
1.  Reservation in Government jobs         :    Minimum 4%
2.  Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions: Minimum 2%
3.  Free education for children with benchmark disabilities:  Age 6-18 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities and free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18. The reservation in higher educational institutions is 5%, not 2%. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific provisions within the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The inclusion of an incorrect percentage for higher education reservation acts as a significant distractor.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act related to Manual Scavenging      :   Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:  Allows continued employment of manual scavengers with protective gear.
2.  The same Act                         :   Mandates demolition of insanitary latrines.
3.  The same Act                         :   Provides no rehabilitation measures for manual scavengers.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Act prohibits the employment of manual scavengers and mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines to prevent the practice.  The Act also provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, making pair 3 incorrect.  The allowance of continued employment with protective gear is not a provision of the Act. This question tests detailed understanding of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, focusing on specific provisions. The distractors test the candidate's ability to differentiate between the actual provisions and potential misconceptions.


**8. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Aim/Feature of NEP 2020              :   Target/Detail
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education: 50% by 2035
2.  Multiple exit options in Undergraduate degrees:  Only 4-year duration degrees
3.  Establishment of National Research Foundation (NRF): To reduce research and innovation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. NEP 2020 aims for a 50% GER in higher education by 2035.  Undergraduate degrees offer multiple exit options, including 3-year and 4-year durations.  The NRF is intended to *expand* research and innovation, not reduce it. This question tests understanding of specific aims and features of NEP 2020.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's knowledge of the policy's details.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Institution            :  Function/Role
1.  National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT):  Develops school curricula and textbooks.
2.  University Grants Commission (UGC):   Accredits higher education institutions.
3.  National Medical Commission (NMC):    Regulates medical education and practice.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. NCERT is responsible for curriculum development, UGC for recognition and some aspects of accreditation of higher education institutions, and NMC for regulating medical education and practice. This question tests factual recall of the roles and functions of key educational and regulatory bodies in India.  The inclusion of all three correct pairs increases the difficulty level by eliminating the possibility of easy guessing.


**10. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                               :   Description
1.  Levels 1-4                             :   Higher Education
2.  Levels 4.5-8                           :   School Education
3.  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)       :   Digital storage of academic credits

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Levels 1-4 in NCrF refer to school education, and levels 4.5-8 refer to higher education.  The ABC is a digital repository for academic credits. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the structure and components of the NCrF. The incorrect pairing of levels with education stages serves as a strong distractor.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Community                     State/UT
1.  Bharia PVTG                         :   Chhattisgarh
2.  Kamar PVTG                          :   Madhya Pradesh
3.  Baiga PVTG                          :   Andaman & Nicobar Islands
4.  Hakki Pikki Tribe                    :   Karnataka
5.  Konda Reddis                         :   Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are incorrectly matched in their exclusive assignment to a single state. The Hakki Pikki Tribe is a semi-nomadic tribal group primarily found in Karnataka, making pair 4 correct. The Konda Reddis are a tribal group found in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Odisha, but not exclusively in Odisha. Thus, pair 5 is also incorrectly matched.  The question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups in India, highlighting the complexity of tribal demographics and the need for precise knowledge.  Distractors are carefully chosen to include states where some of these groups might have presence, but not their primary location, making simple guessing difficult.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                           Ministry/Organization
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem: Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs: Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
4.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED): Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
5.  Swachhta Udyami Yojana             : Ministry of Rural Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) correctly falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  Swachhta Udyami Yojana is related to the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment and not Ministry of Rural Development.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the governmental agencies responsible for different welfare schemes concerning marginalized communities, demanding precise knowledge of the ministries involved.  The distractors include ministries with related but not exact responsibilities, requiring careful analysis to arrive at the correct answer.



**3.  With reference to Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Category                                        Characteristic
1.  PVTGs                                         :   Pre-agricultural level of technology
2.  Scheduled Tribes                              :   8.6% of India's population (2011 Census)
3.  De-notified Tribes                            :   'Notified' as 'born criminal' during British rule
4.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :   First recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs)
5.  Nomadic Tribes                               : All are De-notified Tribes.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 correctly identifies a criterion for identifying PVTGs. Pair 2 accurately reflects the Scheduled Tribe population percentage according to the 2011 Census. Pair 3 correctly describes the historical context of De-notified Tribes. Pair 4 accurately states that PVTGs were initially recognized as PTGs in 1973. Pair 5 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are De-notified Tribes, only all DNTs are NTs.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the different categories of tribal groups in India, their defining characteristics, and their historical context. The inclusion of distractors like pair 5, which is a subtle inversion of the correct relationship, and pair 1 and 4, which are partially true but incomplete, makes this a challenging question.



**4. With reference to Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Provision                                  Feature
1.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016: Recognizes 21 types of disabilities
2.  Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995           :  Established the Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD
3.  RPwD Act, 2016                               : Reservation not applicable to police forces
4.  RPwD Act, 2016                               : Mandates 5% reservation in all government jobs
5.  Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD           : Under Ministry of Rural Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, correctly recognizes 21 types of disabilities. The Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995, correctly established the Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD. The RPwD Act, 2016, correctly specifies that reservation is not applicable to police forces. However, the RPwD Act, 2016, mandates at least 4%, not 5%, reservation in government jobs. The Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Rural Development. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of legislation related to PwDs in India and their key provisions. Distractors are carefully designed to include partially correct information or to confuse the candidate with similar-sounding ministries or percentage figures, making the question challenging.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution                      Report/Index
1.  UNFPA                                         :  Global Hunger Index
2.  World Economic Forum                       :  Global Gender Gap Index
3.  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe   :  India Ageing Report 2023
4.  United Nations Development Programme      :  Gender Social Norms Index
5.  WHO and World Bank                         :  UHC Service Coverage Index

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The World Economic Forum correctly releases the Global Gender Gap Index. The United Nations Development Programme correctly releases the Gender Social Norms Index. The WHO and World Bank correctly release the UHC Service Coverage Index.  However, UNFPA releases the India Ageing Report 2023, not the Global Hunger Index, which is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The question assesses the candidate's ability to link international organizations with their respective publications and indices.  Distractors are strategically placed to include organizations that deal with similar themes but are not the correct publishers of the listed reports/indices, increasing the question's difficulty.  The candidate needs to possess precise knowledge to answer correctly.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Reform                      Implementing Body/Policy
1.  National Accreditation Council (NAC)      :   University Grants Commission (UGC)
2.  National Curriculum Framework (NCF)      :   National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
3.  National Medical Commission (NMC)        :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
4.  National Credit Framework (NCrF)          :   Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship
5.  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)           :  National Assessment Centre, PARAKH


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Accreditation Council (NAC) is a component of the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI), envisioned under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and overseen by the University Grants Commission (UGC).  The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) is developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).  The National Medical Commission (NMC) is indeed under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) is a digital platform designed to store academic credits earned from various institutions, which aligns with the broader goals of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, making option (d) the most appropriate choice.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude crucial correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the higher education reform landscape in India. The NCrF, while related to higher education, is a joint initiative involving multiple ministries including the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, therefore option (d) is the most accurate.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Report/Initiative
1.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)     :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2.  World Health Organization (WHO)              :   India Ageing Report 2023
3.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI):   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
4.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Global Food Policy Report 2023
5. World Bank                                  : Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR published the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report". The World Bank, in collaboration with the WHO, released the "Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring report".  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misattribute reports to the wrong organizations. The UNFPA released the India Ageing Report 2023, and the IFPRI published the Global Food Policy Report 2023. This highlights the importance of carefully understanding the roles and functions of different international organizations in the context of global development and health initiatives. The question tests the candidate's ability to accurately associate reports with their publishing organizations, demonstrating a deeper understanding of international organizations’ activities and their relevance to global issues.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   NEP 2020 Feature                                    Specific Goal/Outcome
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)                       :   Achieve at least 50% by 2035 in Higher Education
2.  Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) :  Strengthen vocational training opportunities
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)                :   Promote research and innovation across the country.
4.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                     :   Enable seamless credit transfer across different educational institutions.
5.  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF)      :   Improve the quality of primary education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 does aim to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to at least 50% by 2035. The policy also establishes the National Research Foundation (NRF) to boost research and innovation.  The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is designed to facilitate credit transfer among various educational institutions. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because the NETF's focus is on enhancing learning, assessment, and administration in both schools and higher education, not specifically primary education. Option (a) and (b) are incomplete, missing key correctly matched pairs.  The question tests the understanding of the NEP 2020's key features and their intended outcomes, highlighting the policy's multi-faceted approach to educational reform in India.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as the misinterpretation of MERUs' role, adds to the question's difficulty.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Act                                 Primary Focus Area
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Child labour eradication
2.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                               :  Universal Health Coverage
3.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme            :  Rehabilitation of manual scavengers
4.  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)           :  Nutritional and health status improvement of children (0-6 years)
5.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)                       :  Open Defecation Free (ODF) status


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a flagship health insurance scheme focused on Universal Health Coverage. The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women and lactating mothers. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) focuses on achieving Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in rural areas. Options (a), (b) and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the primary focus areas of the schemes. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, and the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme address distinct issues—manual scavenging and child labour, respectively. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of key government schemes and their respective goals, testing their knowledge of social welfare programs in India. The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as mismatching the focus of the manual scavenging act, makes the question challenging.


**5. With reference to Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Category                                    Characteristic/Status
1.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)         :   Highest population of Scheduled Tribes in India
2.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                             :   Communities historically labeled as "criminal tribes"
3.  Scheduled Tribes (STs)                               :   Always categorized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
4.  Hakki Pikki Tribe                                    :   A semi-nomadic tribal group from Karnataka
5.  Bharia Tribe                                          :   Granted Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Denotified Tribes (DNTs) were indeed historically labeled as "criminal tribes" during the British Raj. The Hakki Pikki Tribe is a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka. The Bharia tribe is among those granted Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.  Option (d) is incorrect because while PVTGs are a subset of STs, not all STs are PVTGs. Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of STs, not PVTGs. Option (a) and (b) are incomplete, failing to include all correctly matched pairs. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of different tribal groups in India and their specific characteristics, requiring a nuanced understanding of the complexities of tribal welfare issues. The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as incorrect categorization of STs, makes the question more challenging.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                     State/UT
1. Bharia                                  :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar                                   :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga                                   :   Andaman & Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is indeed listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Chhattisgarh.  The Kamar and Baiga tribes are also PVTGs, but they are found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, not exclusively in Madhya Pradesh as option 2 suggests. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have their own unique PVTGs; the Baiga tribe is not exclusively located there.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrect pairings of tribes and states/UTs based on the provided information.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to correctly match tribal groups with their locations.  Understanding the geographical distribution of PVTGs is crucial for comprehending India's diverse tribal populations and the specific challenges they face.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs          :   Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology     :   Use of advanced irrigation techniques
2. Low level of literacy                     :   Literacy rate exceeding 80%
3. Economic backwardness                  :   High per capita income
4. Declining or stagnant population         :   Rapid population growth

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are the opposite of what is presented in the options.  PVTGs are characterized by a pre-agricultural level of technology (meaning they do not use advanced irrigation), low literacy rates (significantly below 80%), economic backwardness (low per capita income), and a declining or stagnant population (not rapid growth).  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the defining characteristics of PVTGs. It highlights the importance of understanding the socio-economic realities of these vulnerable groups for effective policymaking and intervention strategies. The options provide plausible distractors by offering the opposite of the actual criteria, making the question challenging.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      :   State where they were granted Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006
1. Bharia                                    :   Odisha
2. Kamar                                     :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga                                     :   Chhattisgarh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe was granted habitat rights in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha. The Kamar and Baiga tribes were granted habitat rights in Chhattisgarh. The question tests factual recall about the implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006, and its impact on specific tribal communities.  Understanding the geographical distribution of habitat rights granted under the Act is important for assessing the effectiveness of the policy in protecting tribal land rights. The inclusion of Odisha as a plausible distractor for the Bharia tribe increases the difficulty level.


**4. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                                         :   Status
1. All nomadic tribes are DNTs                      :   True
2. All DNTs are nomadic tribes                     :   True
3. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, is still in force  :   True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; DNTs are a subset of nomadic tribes.  The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was repealed.  This question tests the understanding of the historical context and current status of DNTs. It requires an understanding of the legal framework surrounding DNTs and its evolution.  The inclusion of incorrect statements as plausible distractors makes the question challenging and assesses the candidate's ability to critically evaluate information.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme for DNTs               :   Implementing Ministry
1. Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric Scholarship     :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2. Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme                   :   Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3. Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) :   Ministry of Rural Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme is correctly paired with its implementing ministry, the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric Scholarship is implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The SEED scheme is also implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Rural Development. This question tests factual recall about government schemes for DNTs and their respective implementing ministries. It assesses the candidate's knowledge of social welfare programs targeted at marginalized communities and their administrative structures.  The incorrect pairings act as effective distractors, requiring precise knowledge to answer correctly.


**6. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision                                     :    Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs              :   Minimum 5% reservation
2. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities :  Applies to children aged 6-18 years
3. Reservation in police forces                 :   Minimum 4% reservation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the provision regarding free education for children with benchmark disabilities is correctly matched. The Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%, and reservation is explicitly *not* applicable to police forces. This question tests detailed knowledge of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.  It assesses the ability to recall specific provisions and differentiate between correct and incorrect interpretations of the law. The incorrect options include plausible distractors that are close to the correct information, requiring a precise understanding of the Act's stipulations.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act Related to Manual Scavenging       :   Key Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Allows continued employment in insanitary latrines with protective gear.
2. PEMSR                                   :   Mandates demolition of insanitary latrines.
3.  The Constitution of India              :   Explicitly prohibits manual scavenging.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prohibits employment in insanitary latrines, not allows it even with protective gear. The Constitution of India does not explicitly prohibit manual scavenging; the prohibition is through legislation.  This question tests knowledge of the legal framework addressing manual scavenging.  It assesses the candidate's ability to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate interpretations of the law and its provisions. The inclusion of plausible distractors makes the question more challenging.


**8. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Area of Focus                               :   Description
1. Capacities for Scientific Inquiry          :   Focuses solely on theoretical knowledge.
2. Interdisciplinary Areas of Study           :   Offered only at the primary level.
3. Environmental Education                   :   Integrated across all stages of schooling.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the statement regarding environmental education is correctly matched.  The NCF-SE emphasizes developing capacities for scientific inquiry beyond theoretical knowledge, and interdisciplinary areas of study are not limited to the primary level.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the key features of the NCF-SE, specifically its approach to science education and environmental awareness.  The inclusion of incorrect statements as plausible distractors tests the candidate's ability to critically evaluate information related to educational reforms.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                               :   Headquarters
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Rome, Italy
2.  UNHCR                                     :   Geneva, Switzerland
3.  UNFPA                                     :   Washington, D.C., USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the UNHCR's headquarters location is correctly matched. IFPRI is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA, and UNFPA is headquartered in New York, USA. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations and their locations.  It assesses the ability to recall specific information about these organizations, which is important for understanding global governance and development initiatives.  The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, requiring precise knowledge for a correct response.


**10. With reference to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following pairs:**

    Framework                                    :   Developing Body
1. Global Indicator Framework (GIF)           :   Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), India
2.  State Indicator Framework (SIF)           :   Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs)
3.  National Indicator Framework (NIF)         :   IAEG-SDGs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The GIF is developed by the IAEG-SDGs, not MoSPI. The SIFs are developed by individual states/UTs, not the IAEG-SDGs. The NIF is developed by MoSPI, India, not the IAEG-SDGs. This question tests understanding of the different frameworks used for monitoring SDGs and their respective developing bodies.  It assesses the candidate's ability to distinguish between national and international frameworks and their respective roles.  The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, demanding precise knowledge of the institutional structures involved.



**1. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   NEP 2020 Provision                                  Specific Detail
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target                :   100% in preschool to secondary by 2030
2.  Undergraduate degree duration                      :   5 years with multiple exit options
3.  National Assessment Centre                        :   PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review, and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development)
4.  Establishment of a new body                     :   National Research Foundation (NRF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims for 100% GER in preschool to secondary level by 2030.  PARAKH is indeed the proposed name for the National Assessment Centre designed to holistically assess student development. The NEP 2020 also mandates the creation of the National Research Foundation (NRF) to boost research and innovation. However, the undergraduate degree duration, as envisioned by the NEP 2020,  is not a fixed 5 years with multiple exit options, but rather offers  multiple exit options with 3 or 4-year durations depending on the chosen exit point.  The flexibility allows students to exit with a certificate, diploma, or bachelor's degree at different stages. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs related to the Performance Grading Index (PGI):**

   PGI Aspect                                             Specific Data Point
1. Highest grade attained in PGI 2.0 (2021-22)         :  Daksh
2. States/UTs in the lowest grade (Akanshi-3) in PGI 2.0 (2021-22)  : Punjab and Chandigarh
3. Data source for PGI                                   :  UDISE+ 2021-22 data and NAS 2021
4.  Years covered by PGI-D combined report          :  2017-18 and 2018-19

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The PGI uses UDISE+ 2021-22 data and NAS 2021 data, making pair 3 correct.  The highest grade in PGI 2.0 (2021-22) was not Daksh; no state/UT achieved that grade.  Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram were in the lowest grade (Akanshi-3), not Punjab and Chandigarh. The PGI-D combined report covered 2020-21 and 2021-22, not 2017-18 and 2018-19. Hence, only pair 3 is accurately matched.


**3. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs), consider the following pairs:**

   DtbU Regulation/Feature                                    Specific Detail
1.  Minimum age of institution for DtbU status (2023)  :  Less than 20 years
2.  Body granting DtbU status                               :  National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
3.  New regulation superseding the 2019 regulations   :  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023
4.  Action mandated for DtbUs                           :   Compulsory creation of Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for students


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The 2023 regulations for DtbUs reduced the minimum age requirement to less than 20 years, making pair 1 correct. The UGC, not NCERT, grants DtbU status, making pair 2 incorrect. The 2023 regulations did supersede the 2019 regulations, making pair 3 correct.  DtbUs are mandated to create ABC identities for students, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    FHEI Regulation/Feature                                   Specific Detail
1.  Eligibility criterion for FHEIs                         :   Ranked within top 1000 globally
2.  Body granting approval for FHEI campuses in India    :   University Grants Commission (UGC)
3.  Mode of instruction permitted for FHEIs                :   Online and distance learning
4.  Requirement for donations from foreign sources       : Prior permission from the Central Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The UGC grants approval for FHEI campuses in India, making pair 2 correct. FHEIs require prior Central Government permission for foreign donations, making pair 4 correct.  However, the eligibility criterion is ranked within the top 500 globally, not top 1000, making pair 1 incorrect. Online and distance learning modes are not permitted for FHEIs, making pair 3 incorrect.  Thus, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs relating to the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

   NCrF Aspect                                          Specific Detail
1.  Total notional learning hours per year                :   1000 hours
2.  Framework integrating school, higher, and vocational education :  National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) only
3.  Credit storage mechanism                             :  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)
4.  Number of levels in the NCrF credit system        :   8 levels


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The NCrF uses the ABC for credit storage, making pair 3 correct. The NCrF has 8 levels, making pair 4 correct. However, the total notional learning hours per year is 1200, not 1000, making pair 1 incorrect.  The NCrF integrates NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF, not just NHEQF, making pair 2 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

    Anganwadi Aspect                                     Specific Detail
1.  Primary implementing Ministry                       :  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2.  Mobile application for service delivery monitoring  :  Poshan Tracker
3.  Enhanced monthly honorarium for Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) : ₹5000
4.  Coverage under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) :  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Poshan Tracker app is used for monitoring Anganwadi service delivery, making pair 2 correct.  AWWs and AWHs are covered under PMJJBY, making pair 4 correct. However, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, primarily implements the Anganwadi scheme, making pair 1 incorrect. The enhanced monthly honorarium for AWWs is ₹4500, not ₹5000, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**7.  With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following pairs:**

    PEMSR Aspect                                     Specific Detail
1.  Penalty for employing manual scavengers          :  Imprisonment up to 5 years
2.  Designated body for identifying manual scavengers :  Local authorities (municipalities or panchayats)
3.  Scheme for rehabilitation of manual scavengers     :  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)
4.  A key initiative for mechanized sanitation         : NAMASTE scheme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Local authorities are responsible for identifying manual scavengers, making pair 2 correct. The SRMS scheme focuses on rehabilitating manual scavengers, making pair 3 correct.  The NAMASTE scheme promotes mechanized sanitation, making pair 4 correct. However, the penalty for employing manual scavengers under PEMSR is imprisonment up to 2 years, not 5 years, making pair 1 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs related to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013:**

    Act Aspect                                     Specific Detail
1.  Body to receive complaints from organizations with less than 10 workers: Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)
2.  Time limit for filing a complaint                   :  Six months from the date of the incident
3.  Mechanism for settling disputes before inquiry       : Conciliation
4.  Action against false complaints                     :  Recommendation by the ICC to the employer


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Act allows for conciliation to settle disputes before an inquiry, making pair 3 correct.  The ICC can recommend action against those making false complaints, making pair 4 correct.  However, the ICC is not the body to receive complaints from organizations with fewer than 10 workers; a Local Committee handles such cases, making pair 1 incorrect. The time limit for filing a complaint is three months, not six months, making pair 2 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.



**1. With reference to Child Labour in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                     Key Feature
1. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016 : Prohibits employment of children below 10 years in all employment
2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme     : Managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development
3. PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal :  Focuses primarily on rescuing children from hazardous occupations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all occupations and also prohibits adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  Option 1 incorrectly states the age limit as 10 years. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development, making option 2 incorrect. The PENCiL portal is indeed a crucial tool for rescuing and rehabilitating child labourers, focusing on effective enforcement and rescue operations, making option 3 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1 (corrected) and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                     Description
1. Definition of "Child"                          :  A person who has not completed 16 years of age.
2.  Adoption process                             : Finalized only after a District Magistrate's order.
3.  Categories of Offences                       :  Includes 'heinous offences' with a minimum punishment of 5 years imprisonment.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The JJ Act defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age, making statement 1 incorrect.  The JJ Amendment Act, 2021, allows District Magistrates to issue adoption orders, making statement 2 correct.  The JJ Act categorizes offences into heinous, serious, and petty offences.  Heinous offences carry a minimum punishment of 7 years or more imprisonment, making statement 3 also correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following pairs:**

   Component                                     Characteristic
1. Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)          :  Mandatory in organizations with 5 or more employees.
2.  Time Limit for Filing Complaints             :  Extendable by the ICC beyond the initial three-month limit.
3.  Action Against False Complaints               :  The ICC can recommend action against the complainant, but it is not mandatory.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act mandates ICCs in organizations with 10 or more employees, not 5, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Act allows the ICC to extend the three-month complaint filing deadline, making statement 2 correct.  The Act empowers the ICC to recommend action against those who file false complaints, but this is not a mandatory action, making statement 3 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                          Definition
1. Manual Scavenger                              :  Includes individuals cleaning human waste with appropriate protective gear.
2.  Insanitary Latrine                             :  A latrine that is not designed to prevent manual handling of human waste.
3.  Rehabilitation Measures                        :  Primarily focuses on providing financial assistance without skill development programs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as those handling human waste without appropriate protective gear; those using such gear are excluded, making statement 1 incorrect. The definition of an insanitary latrine in the act aligns with statement 2, making it correct.  The Act includes provisions for skill development and alternate employment along with financial assistance, making statement 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                     Detail
1. Allowed Type of Surrogacy                    :  Commercial surrogacy is permitted under specific circumstances.
2.  Use of Donor Gametes                        :  Prohibited in all cases of surrogacy. (Prior to Amendment)
3.  National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) :  Monitors the implementation of the Act.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy Act, 2021, only allows altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy, making statement 1 incorrect.  Before the 2024 amendments, the use of donor gametes was prohibited, making statement 2 correct. The NARTSB is indeed responsible for monitoring the Act's implementation, making statement 3 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Note that the 2024 amendments changed the rules regarding donor gametes.




**6. With reference to the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5), consider the following pairs:**

   State                                          Key Finding Related to Spousal Abuse
1. Karnataka                                    : Lowest percentage of ever-married women experiencing spousal violence.
2. Bihar                                         : Highest percentage of ever-married women experiencing spousal violence.
3. Telangana                                     : Higher percentage of spousal abuse than Karnataka but lower than Bihar.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NFHS-5 data indicates that Bihar had a higher percentage of ever-married women experiencing spousal violence compared to other states mentioned, and Telangana reported a higher percentage than Karnataka, but lower than Bihar.  Karnataka did not have the lowest percentage. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                          Description
1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) : Officially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
2.  PM JANMAN                                     :  Focuses exclusively on providing housing to PVTG households.
3.  International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples : Celebrated annually on August 9th.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs were indeed first recognized in 1973 as PTGs, making statement 1 correct.  PM JANMAN has a broader scope than just housing; it aims to saturate PVTG households with various basic facilities, making statement 2 incorrect. The International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is celebrated on August 9th, making statement 3 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Aspect                                   Target
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education :  At least 40% by 2035.
2.  Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) :  Establishment across the country to promote multidisciplinary education.
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)            :  To primarily focus on funding research in humanities.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, not 40%, making statement 1 incorrect. The policy does advocate for the establishment of MERUs, making statement 2 correct.  The NRF's mandate includes funding research across various disciplines, not just humanities, making statement 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**9. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Ranking                                     Characteristic
1.  Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore       :  Ranked below 250 in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024.
2.  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 :  Requires institutions to have existed for at least 20 years to apply for Deemed-to-be University status.
3.  National Credit Framework (NCrF)                 :  Exclusively focuses on higher education credit transfer.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

IISc Bangalore was indeed placed in the 201-250 bracket in the Times Higher Education rankings, making statement 1 correct.  The 2023 UGC regulations removed the 20-year existence requirement for applying for Deemed-to-be University status, making statement 2 incorrect.  The NCrF integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education, not exclusively higher education, making statement 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**10. With reference to Women's Issues in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                         Key Provision
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 : Defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse.
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (as amended) : Allows abortion up to 24 weeks for all women.
3.  Boeing Sukanya Program                            : Focuses solely on providing scholarships to women aspiring to be pilots.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PWDVA 2005 encompasses various forms of abuse, not just physical, making statement 1 incorrect.  The MTP Act allows abortion up to 24 weeks only under specific circumstances, not for all women, making statement 2 incorrect. The Boeing Sukanya program has a broader scope, including STEM education and training beyond piloting, making statement 3 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Tribe                     State/Union Territory
1. Bharia PVTG           :  Odisha
2. Kamar PVTG            :  Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG            :  Chhattisgarh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) found in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  The Kamar and Baiga tribes are PVTGs found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Therefore, only pair 3, correctly matching the Baiga PVTG with Chhattisgarh, is accurate. The other pairs contain incorrect state/UT associations for the specified PVTGs.  Understanding the geographical distribution of PVTGs is crucial for comprehending the complexities of tribal welfare policies and their effective implementation.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern accurate information from plausible distractors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Scheme             Ministry
1.  PM JANMAN           : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  SEED Scheme          : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3.  Saksham Anganwadi : Ministry of Women and Child Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan) is a multi-ministry initiative, but its primary focus and implementation are overseen by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative is indeed under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. This question tests factual recall of government schemes and their associated ministries.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the administrative structures responsible for implementing welfare programs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Legislation          Key Provision
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Criminalizes beggary
2.  The Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959  :  Bans manual scavenging
3.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :  Mandates 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, focuses specifically on eliminating manual scavenging, not beggary. The Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, criminalizes beggary, not manual scavenging. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, correctly mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities.  This question tests knowledge of specific legislation and their key features.  The distractors highlight the importance of understanding the precise scope and provisions of each Act.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization/Body        Mandate/Function
1.  National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) :  Oversees medical education and practice
2.  National Medical Commission (NMC) :  Central repository of crime data
3.  Competition Commission of India (CCI) :  Eliminates practices having adverse effects on competition

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCRB's function is indeed the central collection and analysis of crime data, not overseeing medical education.  The NMC's primary role is the regulation of medical education and practice in India. The CCI accurately works to promote and sustain competition in the Indian market.  The question tests the understanding of the roles of various governmental and regulatory bodies in India.  The incorrect pairings act as strong distractors, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of each organization's mandate.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

Statement                                      Status
1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of STs in absolute numbers. : Correct
2.  Arunachal Pradesh entirely falls under the Protected Area Permit regime.   : Correct
3.  The Henderson Doctrine prevents relitigation of issues addressed in the original proceedings. : Correct

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are factually correct. Madhya Pradesh does have the largest Scheduled Tribe population numerically.  Arunachal Pradesh does require a Protected Area Permit (PAP) for all foreign nationals to enter. The Henderson Doctrine, originating from English common law, does indeed prevent the relitigation of issues already decided in a prior proceeding.  This question tests factual knowledge across various domains, including demographics, legal procedures, and administrative regulations.  The options are designed to test the candidate's ability to identify the completely accurate statements.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Report/Index                  Releasing Organization/Body
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI) :  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
2.  Global Gender Gap Index :  World Bank
3.  Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) : World Health Organization and World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is correctly attributed to Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is correctly linked to the WHO and the World Bank. However, the Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not the World Bank. This question assesses the knowledge of various reports, indices, and the organizations responsible for their publication. The inclusion of the World Bank as a distractor in option 2 makes the question more challenging.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy                    Key Feature/Objective
1.  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 :  Establishment of a National Accreditation Council (NAC)
2.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 : Allows only altruistic surrogacy
3.  The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 :  Provides for a National Council for Transgender Persons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 does envision the establishment of a National Accreditation Council (NAC) for higher education institutions. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, indeed permits only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy.  The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, correctly establishes a National Council for Transgender Persons to advise the government on policies and programs. This question tests knowledge of key features of significant Acts and policies.  All three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.


**8. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

Worker Category           Key Function/Responsibility
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW) :  Focuses primarily on promotion of maternal and child health
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) : Provides early childhood care and development
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) : Creates awareness on factors determining health status

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While AWWs are involved in early childhood care and development, their primary focus is broader than just that, encompassing nutrition and health education.  ANMs' main role is indeed maternal and child health. ASHAs are crucial for community health awareness.  This question tests the nuanced understanding of the roles of different community health workers.  The incorrect pairings highlight the need for precise knowledge of their individual responsibilities within the ICDS scheme.  Only statement 3 is completely correct, making (c) the correct answer.


**9. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2023, consider the following pairs:**

Area of Focus                Key Aspect
1. Science Education          :  Emphasis on developing capacities for scientific inquiry
2. Environmental Education :  Offered as a separate subject at the primary stage
3. Higher Education           :  Multidisciplinary education and research universities (MERUs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF 2023 correctly emphasizes scientific inquiry in science education.  It also promotes the establishment of MERUs in higher education. However, environmental education is not a separate subject at the primary stage; its integration happens across stages, culminating in a separate area of study at the secondary stage.  This question tests detailed knowledge of the NCF 2023 and its recommendations. The distractor in option 2 tests the candidate's precise understanding of the curriculum framework.  Options (a) and (c) are incorrect due to the inaccurate statement regarding environmental education.  Option (d) is wrong because statement 2 is incorrect.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

Legislation/Act              Main Objective/Focus
1.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :  Defines a child as a person below 18 years of age
2.  The POCSO Act, 2012    :  Protection of children from sexual offences
3.  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 :  Abolition of bonded labour

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, correctly defines a child as someone below 18.  The POCSO Act, 2012, accurately aims to protect children from sexual abuse.  However, the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, addresses immoral trafficking, not bonded labour; that falls under a different act. This question assesses knowledge of legislation related to child protection.  The distractor in option 3 tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between acts dealing with different forms of child exploitation.  Option (b) is incorrect as statement 3 is incorrect.  Option (c) is incorrect because statement 2 is also correct.  Option (d) is incorrect as statement 3 is incorrect.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Initiative             Feature
1. National Research Foundation (NRF) :   Modelled on the US National Science Foundation (NSF)
2. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)       :   Digitally stores academic credits from various institutions
3. National Credit Framework (NCrF)    :   Integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, explicitly states that the NRF is modeled on the US National Science Foundation (NSF).  This makes pair 1 correctly matched. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a digital platform designed to store academic credits earned from various educational institutions, accurately reflecting pair 2. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to seamlessly integrate credits earned through different educational pathways – school, higher education, and vocational training – thus making pair 3 correct. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                       Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                             :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
2. UNDESA                                            :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3. IFPRI                                               :   Global Food Policy Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023, making pair 2 correct. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) published the Global Food Policy Report 2023, correctly matching pair 3.  However, the report "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" was released by the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), not the UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund). Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   NEP 2020 Feature                          Target Year
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education to reach at least 50%  :  2035
2.  Universal Access to schooling from pre-primary to Grade 12             :  2030
3.  Implementation of the 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure   :  2025

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, making pair 1 correct.  The policy also targets universal access to schooling from pre-primary to Grade 12 by 2030, making pair 2 correct. However, the implementation of the 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure is not tied to a specific year like 2025 in the NEP 2020 document; it's a phased rollout.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Act                     Focus Area
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Mechanized sanitation
2.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                     :   Universal Health Coverage
3.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan :   Reducing stunting

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a major initiative aimed at achieving Universal Health Coverage in India, making pair 2 correct. The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan focuses on reducing malnutrition, including stunting, thus making pair 3 correct.  However, while the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to eliminate manual scavenging, its primary focus is not on the mechanization of sanitation; that is addressed through other initiatives like NAMASTE. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.


**5. With reference to the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for School Education, consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                                      PGI Grade in 2021-22
1.  Punjab                                         :   Daksh
2.  Chandigarh                                    :   Prachesta – 2
3.  Arunachal Pradesh                             :   Akanshi – 3

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandigarh achieved the Prachesta – 2 grade in the PGI 2.0 for 2021-22, making pair 2 correct.  Arunachal Pradesh was placed in the lowest grade, Akanshi – 3, correctly matching pair 3. However, no state/UT attained the highest grade (Daksh) in the 2021-22 PGI 2.0 assessment, making pair 1 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                                   Status/Location
1.  Bharia                                          :   Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Odisha
2.  Kamar                                          :   PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
3.  Baiga                                           :   PVTG in only Madhya Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kamar and Baiga tribes are indeed listed as PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making pair 2 correct. However, the Bharia tribe is a PVTG, but it's found in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  The Baiga tribe is also found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making pair 3 incorrect.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Provision
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021            :   Allows commercial surrogacy
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :   Allows termination up to 24 weeks for all women
3.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Mandates 5% reservation in all government jobs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, making pair 1 incorrect.  The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women and beyond 20 weeks under specific conditions, not up to 24 weeks for all women, making pair 2 incorrect. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following pairs:**

   Category of Offences                     Description
1. Heinous Offences                       :   Minimum punishment is imprisonment for three years or more
2. Serious Offences                       :   Punishment is imprisonment between three to seven years
3. Petty Offences                           :   Maximum punishment is imprisonment up to three years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description of Serious Offences (imprisonment between three to seven years) and Petty Offences (maximum punishment is imprisonment up to three years) in relation to the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, are accurate. However, the definition of Heinous Offences under the Act involves a minimum punishment of seven years or more, not three years or more, making pair 1 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Educational Framework                      Prominent Feature
1. National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) :  Culminates in a separate area of study on Environmental Education at the Secondary Stage
2. National Credit Framework (NCrF)           :   Integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education
3. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) :  Part of the National Credit Framework (NCrF)
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) explicitly aims to integrate environmental education at all stages of schooling, culminating in a dedicated area of study at the secondary level. This aligns perfectly with pair 1.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is designed to seamlessly integrate credits from various educational pathways, including school, higher education, and vocational training. This directly corresponds to pair 2. Finally, the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) is a key component within the broader NCrF structure, making pair 3 also accurate. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the accurately matched pairs.


**2. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Policy                        Characteristic
1. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020     :   Aims for a 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) by 2035
2. National Research Foundation (NRF)      :   Modeled on the US National Science Foundation (NSF)
3. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)           :   Digitally stores academic credits earned from various institutions
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 sets a target of at least 50% GER by 2035, making pair 1 correct.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023 explicitly states that the NRF is modeled after the US National Science Foundation (NSF), validating pair 2.  The NEP 2020 also introduced the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) to digitally store credits earned from different institutions, confirming the accuracy of pair 3.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, replaces and updates several sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including those relating to dowry death. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, significantly expands access to abortion services under specific circumstances.  The POSH Act, 2013, mandates the establishment of ICCs in workplaces to address sexual harassment. The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with disabilities.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of the legal framework related to various social issues and their implications, demonstrating knowledge of legal provisions and their impact on society.  This is crucial for understanding the evolution of legal protections and the enforcement mechanisms related to various social issues.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                          Headquarters

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct matching is only for pair 4. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is indeed headquartered in New York, USA.  Let's examine the incorrect pairs:

* **Pair 1:** IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., USA, not Geneva, Switzerland. Geneva is the headquarters of several other UN agencies, which might be a distractor for candidates familiar with UN organizations.

* **Pair 2:** UNHCR's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not Washington, D.C., USA.  This is a deliberate attempt to confuse candidates by swapping the headquarters of IFPRI and UNHCR.

* **Pair 3:** GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York, USA.  Again, this involves swapping the headquarters of a UN organization with another to create a plausible but incorrect option.


The question tests factual recall regarding the headquarters of international organizations.  The incorrect options utilize plausible distractors, requiring candidates to have precise knowledge to answer correctly.  The inclusion of multiple UN organizations adds a layer of difficulty, potentially leading candidates to rely on general knowledge rather than specific facts.  This question assesses recall and the ability to differentiate between similar organizations.


**2. With reference to the reports released by international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Report Title                                      Releasing Organization

3. Global Food Policy Report 2023 : UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) indeed released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023.  Let's examine the incorrect pairs:

* **Pair 1:** The "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" was released by the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), not the WFP (World Food Programme).  This is a distractor playing on the fact that both organizations deal with global issues.

* **Pair 3:** The "Global Food Policy Report 2023" was released by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), not the UNCPD (UN Commission on Population and Development).  This distractor is designed to confuse candidates familiar with food security issues and UN organizations.

This question tests factual recall regarding the reports released by specific international organizations. The incorrect options present plausible distractors, requiring candidates to possess precise knowledge of the reports and their sources to arrive at the correct answer. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar organizations dealing with related global issues.

3. 1941                                      : Caste-based data collected but not published
4. 2011                                      : Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) conducted

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The question tests factual recall about the history of caste census in India.  Each pair represents a significant milestone in the timeline of caste data collection.  There are no plausible distractors here, making it a straightforward question of factual recall.  However, the inclusion of multiple years and events related to caste census makes it a challenging question demanding precise knowledge. This question assesses factual recall and chronological understanding of events related to caste census.

   Policy Aspect                             Specific Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)           : Target of 50% by 2035 in higher education
2. Undergraduate Degrees                 :  Only 4-year duration
3. Multidisciplinary Education             : Establishment of National Research Foundation (NRF)
4. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)         : Digital storage of academic credits

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  NEP 2020 does aim for a 50% GER in higher education by 2035, and the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is designed for digital storage of academic credits. Let's look at the incorrect pairs:

* **Pair 2:** NEP 2020 proposes both 3-year and 4-year undergraduate degree options, not exclusively 4-year programs.  This is a deliberate attempt to create a plausible but incorrect option.

* **Pair 3:** While NEP 2020 promotes multidisciplinary education, the establishment of the National Research Foundation (NRF) is a separate initiative aimed at boosting research, though related to the broader goals of multidisciplinary learning. This creates a connection but not a direct cause-and-effect relationship.

This question tests the understanding of specific features of NEP 2020.  The incorrect options utilize plausible distractors, requiring a precise understanding of the policy's provisions to answer correctly. The question assesses conceptual understanding and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct aspects of the policy.

    Act/Scheme                                     Key Provision/Feature
1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 : Defines domestic violence to include only physical and sexual abuse
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971   :  Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks in all cases
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Does not include safalkarmis as manual scavengers
4.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016     : Mandates 4% reservation in all government jobs, including police forces


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests detailed knowledge of specific acts and their provisions, designed to be challenging.

* **Pair 1:** The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 defines domestic violence more broadly, including physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.

* **Pair 2:** The MTP Act allows termination up to 24 weeks under specific conditions, not in all cases.

* **Pair 3:** The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act includes safalkarmis (those working as sweepers in municipalities etc.) as manual scavengers.

* **Pair 4:** The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act mandates 4% reservation in most government jobs, but excludes police forces.

This question requires precise knowledge of legal provisions.  The incorrect options are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the nuances of the laws.  The question assesses factual recall and attention to detail in understanding legal frameworks.  The difficulty arises from the need for precise recall and the potential for confusion between similar legal provisions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a comprehensive healthcare scheme aiming to improve health at all levels—primary, secondary, and tertiary care.  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) leverages technology to enhance access and portability of healthcare services, including through telemedicine.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush specifically targets children and pregnant women who haven't received all their scheduled vaccinations. All three pairs accurately reflect the key features of the respective schemes.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. The question tests factual recall of government healthcare initiatives and their core objectives.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed honorarium and additional performance-linked incentives. The Poshan Tracker app is a crucial tool for monitoring malnutrition and tracking nutrition service delivery.  Saksham Anganwadis, while strengthening existing AWCs, also expand their focus to include adolescent girls and early childhood care and education, exceeding the scope of only children aged 0-6 years. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched ones.  This question assesses factual recall concerning the Anganwadi system's operational aspects.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Report Published

The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) indeed released the India Ageing Report 2023. The UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) published the SDG Progress Report 2023. IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) released the Global Food Policy Report 2023.  However, the Triple Threat Report was published by UNICEF, not WHO and the World Bank. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair involving the Triple Threat Report. The question tests the knowledge of international organizations and their respective publications, demanding factual recall and analysis.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                    Source Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index                     :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index                   :   World Economic Forum
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)            :   WHO and World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) is indeed jointly released by the WHO and the World Bank.  However, the Global Gender Gap Index is published by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.  Similarly, the Gender Social Norms Index is published by the UNDP, not the World Economic Forum. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. The question assesses factual recall concerning development indicators and their source organizations, requiring careful attention to detail.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Main Objective

3.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :   Allow only altruistic surrogacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act aims to eliminate manual scavenging and promote the use of sanitary latrines. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem focuses on eliminating hazardous cleaning practices. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, legalized only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy. All three pairs accurately reflect the main objectives of the respective acts/policies. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.  This question tests the understanding of social legislation and policies aimed at improving sanitation and regulating surrogacy, demanding factual recall and conceptual understanding.

3.  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) : Includes provisions for inclusive education for children with disabilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice Act correctly defines a child as someone below 18 years. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) includes provisions for inclusive education for children with disabilities. However, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, recognizes 21, not 10, types of disabilities. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair or exclude correctly matched pairs. The question tests knowledge of legislation related to disability rights and child protection, demanding factual recall and analysis.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**3. With reference to the government schemes related to child welfare, consider the following pairs:**

Scheme Name                             Ministry/Organization
1. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0   : Ministry of Labour and Employment
2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) : Ministry of Women and Child Development
3. PENCiL Portal                         : Ministry of Labour and Employment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**4. With reference to the legal frameworks related to women's rights, consider the following pairs:**

Act/Regulation                                  Key Provision
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 : Allows surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete is from the intending couple.
2. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA) 2005 : Defines domestic violence to include only physical and sexual abuse.
3. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 : Mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations with 5 or more employees.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NRF Act is focused on research, not medical education. The NCF-SE correctly describes the 5+3+3+4 stage structure for schooling.  The NCrF accurately aims to integrate credits across different educational pathways.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy                                       Primary Objective
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  To eliminate manual scavenging
2.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan  : To reduce stunting and improve nutrition among children

**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   State                                    Number of PVTGs
1.  Madhya Pradesh                         :    2
2.  Odisha                                  :   13
3.  Chhattisgarh                           :    2
4.  Andaman and Nicobar Islands           :    1

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because Odisha indeed houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  The other options contain incorrect data. Madhya Pradesh has more than 2 PVTGs. Chhattisgarh also has more than 2 PVTGs, and while the Andaman and Nicobar Islands do have PVTGs, the number is not limited to just one.  The question tests factual recall of the number of PVTGs in different states, highlighting the uneven distribution of these vulnerable groups across India. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect figures for Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and a partially correct statement regarding Andaman and Nicobar Islands, makes this a difficult question, requiring precise knowledge to avoid selection of distractors.  Understanding the concept of PVTGs and their geographical distribution is crucial for answering this question correctly.


**2. With reference to De-notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                 Key Feature

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. The SEED scheme aims to empower DNTs through competitive exam coaching. The National Commission for DNTs is tasked with preparing a state-wise list of DNT castes.  Finally, August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities. This question tests factual recall about legislation, government schemes, and observances related to DNTs.  The comprehensive nature of the question, covering multiple aspects of DNT welfare, makes it challenging.  The examinee needs to have a strong understanding of the historical context, government initiatives, and social events related to DNTs.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                  Specific Detail

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs accurately reflect provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and 5% in higher educational institutions for persons with disabilities. It also explicitly recognizes intellectual disability and acid attack victims as persons with disabilities.  Further, it guarantees free education to children with benchmark disabilities aged between 6 and 18. This question tests detailed knowledge of the act's provisions.  The inclusion of multiple pairs, each focusing on a different aspect of the act, makes it a difficult question.  Accurate recall and understanding of the act's specific clauses are essential to select the correct answer.


**4. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, consider the following pairs:**

   Offence                                   Description
1.  Employing manual scavengers            :   Cleaning insanitary latrines
2.  Constructing insanitary latrines         :   Violation of the Act
3.  Cleaning sewers without protective gear :   Violation of the Act
4.  Failing to demolish insanitary latrines  :   Violation of the Act

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately represent offences under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. The act explicitly prohibits employing individuals as manual scavengers for cleaning insanitary latrines.  Constructing insanitary latrines, cleaning sewers without protective gear, and failing to demolish insanitary latrines are all violations of the act. This question demands detailed knowledge of the specific offenses outlined in the legislation. The comprehensive nature of the question and the potential for confusion between different types of violations make it a challenging question.  The examinee needs a thorough grasp of the act's provisions to avoid selecting incorrect options.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Key Focus/Mandate
1.  UNFPA                                      :   Achieving three zeros (ending unmet need for family planning, preventable maternal deaths, gender-based violence) by 2030

4.  PGI 2.0                                   :   Grades States/UTs and districts on school education performance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect key features of the respective educational initiatives. The NCF-SE 2023 indeed introduced the 5+3+3+4 curricular structure. The National Credit Framework aims to integrate credits across different educational levels. The UGC Regulations 2023 allow top-ranked foreign higher education institutions to establish campuses in India. Finally, PGI 2.0 grades States/UTs and districts based on their school education performance.  This question tests the examinee's knowledge of recent reforms and frameworks in the Indian education system.  The multiple initiatives and their diverse features make this a difficult question.  The examinee needs a strong understanding of the recent educational policy changes in India.

   Tribe                                      State/Union Territory
1. Bharia                                   :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar                                    :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga                                     :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4. Hakki Pikki                              :   Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Option 1 is therefore incorrect. The Kamar tribe is also a PVTG found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making option 2 incorrect. The Baiga tribe is a PVTG present in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, but not in Andaman and Nicobar Islands; hence, option 3 is wrong. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic tribal group primarily residing in Karnataka.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of tribal groups and their geographical distribution, highlighting the complexities and nuances often overlooked in generalized discussions of tribal populations in India.  Understanding the precise distribution of PVTGs is crucial for effective policy implementation and resource allocation.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related but ultimately distinct geographical locations and tribal groups.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs           Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology     :   Use of advanced farming techniques
2. Low level of literacy                     :    High literacy rates exceeding national average
3. Economic backwardness                  :   High per capita income
4. Declining or stagnant population         :   Rapid population growth

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are the exact opposite of what is described in the options.  PVTGs are characterized by a pre-agricultural level of technology (meaning they haven't adopted advanced farming methods), low literacy rates, economic backwardness (low per capita income), and a declining or stagnant population (not rapid growth). This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the defining characteristics of PVTGs. The incorrect options act as effective distractors, testing the candidate's ability to critically analyze the provided descriptions against the actual criteria.  A thorough understanding of PVTG identification is essential for formulating appropriate welfare policies and programs.  The question's difficulty arises from the need for precise knowledge of these criteria and the ability to identify the incorrect pairings amidst plausible alternatives.

2. Kamar                                    :   Not classified as a PVTG
3. Baiga                                     :   High levels of economic development
4. Odisha                                   :   Houses the lowest number of PVTGs in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are incorrectly matched. The Bharia tribe is found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Kamar and Baiga tribes are classified as PVTGs.  The Baiga tribe, like other PVTGs, is characterized by economic backwardness, not high levels of economic development. Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India, contradicting statement 4. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific tribal groups and their attributes. The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, challenging the candidate to recall accurate information and differentiate between similar-sounding but factually different statements. Accurate knowledge of tribal demographics is crucial for targeted policy interventions and resource allocation.  The difficulty is amplified by the need for precise recall and the presence of plausible, yet incorrect, options.


**4. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Act                      Recommendation/Feature
1. Idate Commission                      :   Recommended against setting up a permanent commission for DNTs
2. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871            :   Currently in force
3. Renke Commission, 2008             :   Estimated nearly 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Idate Commission recommended establishing a permanent commission for DNTs, making option 1 incorrect.  The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was repealed, not currently in force, making option 2 incorrect. The Renke Commission, 2008, accurately estimated the number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes. This question tests the candidate's understanding of historical legislation and commissions related to DNTs.  The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, requiring the candidate to recall specific details about these commissions and their recommendations.  Understanding the historical context of DNT categorization is vital for appreciating the current challenges faced by these communities. The difficulty stems from the need for precise recall of factual information related to specific commissions and their reports.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                      Ministry
1. Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2. Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)    : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
3. Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme                    : Ministry of Minority Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, making option 1 incorrect. The SEED scheme is correctly attributed to the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme is also administered by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Minority Affairs, making option 3 incorrect. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of government schemes aimed at the welfare of DNTs and the ministries responsible for their implementation.  The incorrect options are carefully constructed to test the candidate's ability to accurately associate schemes with the correct ministries.  A strong understanding of government initiatives and their administrative structures is crucial for comprehending the policy landscape related to social justice and welfare.  The question's difficulty lies in the need for specific knowledge of the ministries responsible for various welfare schemes.


**6. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                     Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs           :  Not less than 2% reservation
2. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities:  Only for children attending special schools
3. Recognition of disabilities                :  15 types of disabilities recognized

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs, not 2%.  Free education is guaranteed for children with benchmark disabilities in both neighborhood and special schools, making option 2 incorrect. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 15. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the key provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.  The incorrect options are designed to challenge the candidate's knowledge of specific details within the Act, requiring precise recall and accurate interpretation.  Understanding the provisions of this Act is crucial for evaluating government policies concerning disability rights and inclusion. The difficulty lies in the need for precise knowledge of the numerical details and the scope of disability categories covered by the Act.

The incorrect options provide plausible but inaccurate descriptions of the framework's emphasis areas, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between superficially similar but factually distinct statements.  Understanding the NCF-SE is crucial for evaluating the direction and focus of school education reforms in India.  The difficulty stems from the need to accurately recall the framework's core principles and reject misleading statements.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 : Allows surrogacy using donor gametes if the intending couple has a medical condition.
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (amended 2021) : Permits abortion up to 20 weeks for all women.
3. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 : Defines domestic violence to include emotional and economic abuse.
4. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) : Criminalizes employing individuals for manual scavenging without protective gear.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, relaxed the previous prohibition on using donor gametes in surrogacy under specific medical circumstances.  The MTP Act, as amended in 2021, allows abortion up to 20 weeks for all women, expanding access. The PWDVA, 2005, broadened the definition of domestic violence beyond physical harm to encompass emotional and economic abuse, offering a more comprehensive legal framework.  Finally, the PEMSR Act of 2013 directly addresses the issue of manual scavenging, making it illegal to employ individuals for this hazardous work without proper safety equipment.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to organizations working on social issues in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Mandate/Activity
1.  UNFPA                                      : Conducts caste surveys.
2.  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)  : Issues guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offences.
3.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) :  Stresses implementation of Idate Commission report on DNTs.
4.  World Food Programme (WFP) in India       :  Pilots innovative solutions like 'Annapurti' for public distribution systems.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because pairs 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the mandates and activities of the respective organizations.  The NCPCR indeed issues guidelines related to child suspects in heinous offences, aligning with its role in child protection. The NHRC actively advocates for the implementation of the Idate Commission's recommendations concerning De-Notified Tribes (DNTs). The WFP in India is actively involved in piloting innovative solutions such as 'Annapurti' to improve the public distribution system.  Pair 1 is incorrect; UNFPA's mandate focuses on sexual and reproductive health and rights, not caste surveys.  Caste surveys are conducted by governmental bodies.


**3. With reference to government initiatives related to education, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Key Objective
1. National Credit Framework (NCrF)             :  To create a single meta-framework for integrating credits from various educational paths.
2. Performance Grading Index (PGI)             : To assess the performance of school education systems at the district level only.
3. National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) : To emphasize the development of capacities for scientific inquiry.
4.  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 : To allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for Deemed-to-be-University status.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The NCrF aims to integrate credits earned through various educational pathways, creating a more flexible system.  The NCF-SE emphasizes scientific inquiry as a key component of science education. The 2023 UGC regulations for Deemed-to-be Universities allow institutions younger than 20 years to apply, a significant change from previous rules. Pair 2 is incorrect; while PGI does assess district-level performance, it also assesses performance at the state level.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Target Group/Issue Addressed
1.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015: Children in conflict with the law.
2.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system: Manual scavengers.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Global Gender Gap Index 2023 does indeed show India's progress in women's representation in local governance. The NFHS-5 data reveals higher spousal abuse rates in Karnataka compared to some other states.  The Path to Equal Report introduced the WEI and GGPI.  Pair 2 is incorrect; the Gender Social Norms Index assesses women's status across several dimensions, not solely focusing on political participation. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Index                                      Releasing Organization

3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index : World Bank and WHO
4. Women’s Empowerment Index             :   UN Women and UNDP
5. Global Gender Parity Index              :   UN Women and UNDP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, assessing economic participation, education, health, and political empowerment.  The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), focusing on systematic disadvantages faced by women globally across political, educational, economic, and physical integrity dimensions. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is jointly released by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, tracking progress on SDG 3.8.1 across health domains. The Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) are both jointly released by UN Women and UNDP, with WEI focusing solely on women's power and freedoms, while GGPI compares women's status to men's in human development. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly attribute the indices to the wrong organizations, showcasing the importance of precise knowledge of releasing bodies for correct matching.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Index                                         Focus/Measurement
1. Performance Grading Index (PGI) for States/UTs :  District-level school education performance
2. Performance Grading Index (PGI) for Districts (PGI-D) : State and District level school education performance assessment
3. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education : Percentage of students enrolled in higher education in the 18-23 age group
4. Global 2000 Report                           :  Ranking of over 2000 universities worldwide based on quality of education, employability, faculty quality, and research performance

(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for States/UTs assesses school education performance at the state and Union Territory levels.  The PGI for Districts (PGI-D) focuses specifically on district-level school education performance. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education accurately measures the percentage of students enrolled in higher education within the 18-23 age group. The Global 2000 report, by the Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR), ranks universities worldwide based on the mentioned four factors. The QS World University Ranking uses academic reputation, employer reputation, and faculty research as key indicators for its rankings. Option (a) incorrectly states that PGI for States/UTs focuses on district level. Option (b) incorrectly links the PGI indices to incorrect focus. Option (d) incorrectly links the Global 2000 Report to a different focus.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

NEP 2020 Feature                              Specific Detail/Target

(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 indeed aims for a GER of at least 50% by 2035.  Undergraduate degrees are designed to be 3 or 4 years long, offering multiple exit options at different stages.  The policy envisions the establishment of MERUs across India to promote multidisciplinary education.  The NRF is intended to boost research and innovation nationwide.  Finally, the NETF is meant to facilitate the use of technology in education. All the pairs accurately reflect the stated features and targets of the NEP 2020.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                  Report/Index
1.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) : Global Hunger Index (GHI)
2.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
3.  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) :  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
4.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) : India Ageing Report 2023
5.  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) : Global Food Policy Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR publishes reports on forced displacement, aligning with pair 2. The UNFPA released the India Ageing Report 2023 (pair 4). UNDESA produces reports on sustainable development, including the SDG Progress Report.  The IFPRI, however, does *not* release the GHI; that is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. GANHRI does not release the SDG Progress Report; that is released by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA). Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), consider the following pairs:**

ODF Status Category                         Definition/Characteristic
1. ODF                                      :  Every household and public institution uses safe sanitation technology; no visible faeces in the environment
2. ODF Plus                                 :  Sustained ODF status plus implementation of solid or liquid waste management systems
3. ODF Plus Model Village                   :  Sustained ODF status with arrangements for solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and IEC messaging
4.  ODF Plus status under Phase-II          :  75% of Indian villages achieved this status by September 2023.
5.  Open Defecation                           :  Faecal-oral transmission termination


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The definitions of ODF, ODF Plus, and ODF Plus Model Village are accurately described in pairs 1, 2, and 3. The statement about 75% of Indian villages achieving ODF Plus status by September 2023 under Phase-II of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) is also correct (pair 4).  However, open defecation is not the *termination* of faecal-oral transmission; it is the *cause* of it. Thus, pair 5 is incorrectly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) either omit correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched ones.  The question tests factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between accurate and slightly inaccurate descriptions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Nodal Ministry
1.  Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme : Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  Saksham Anganwadis                     : Ministry of Labour and Employment
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission falls under the purview of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, aiming to improve the living conditions of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) is indeed a scheme under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, focused on the rehabilitation of child labourers. However, Saksham Anganwadis, an initiative to strengthen Anganwadi Centres, comes under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Option (a) is correct because only the first pair accurately reflects the nodal ministry responsible for the respective scheme. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs. The other options incorrectly link schemes to ministries not responsible for their administration and implementation.  Understanding the governmental structure and the allocation of responsibilities among different ministries is crucial for comprehending policy implementation in India.


**2. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                         Target Year/Goal
1.  Attainment of 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education  : 2025
2.  Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) : Ongoing process with no specific target year
3.  Establishment of National Research Foundation (NRF)                   : 2030
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 aims for a 50% GER in higher education by 2035, making statement 1 incorrect regarding the year.  The policy advocates for the establishment of MERUs, but without a specific deadline; therefore, statement 2 is correctly matched with its description. The establishment of the NRF is a key component of NEP 2020, but there isn't a stated target year of 2030; this makes statement 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched. Option (b) is the correct answer, highlighting the need to accurately understand the timelines and goals set by NEP 2020.  Options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding the target years or the status of policy implementation.  This question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between policy goals and their actual implementation timelines.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Provision/Feature
1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 : Defines domestic violence to include emotional abuse
2.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021       : Permits commercial surrogacy
3.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 : Recognizes 21 types of disabilities
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, comprehensively defines domestic violence, explicitly including emotional abuse alongside physical, sexual, and economic abuse.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, strictly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, significantly broadened the definition of disabilities, recognizing 21 types. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (c) is correct because it accurately identifies the key provisions of these acts. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain inaccuracies, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the specific details of these legislations.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of significant social legislation and their key features.


**4. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                                   PGI Grade in 2021-22
1.  Punjab                                     Prachesta-1
2.  Chandigarh                                Prachesta-2
3.  Arunachal Pradesh                        Akanshi-3
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

In the PGI 2021-22 assessment, Punjab achieved a Prachesta-2 grade, not Prachesta-1.  Chandigarh also received a Prachesta-2 grade, making the second pair correct.  Arunachal Pradesh was indeed placed in the lowest grade, Akanshi-3. Thus, only the second and third pairs are correctly matched. Option (c) is correct because it accurately identifies the PGI grades for these states/UTs in 2021-22. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain inaccuracies, showing a lack of understanding of the PGI's grading system and its application to different states/UTs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the PGI's assessment methodology and its results.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Headquarter Location
1.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) : Washington, DC (USA)
2.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Geneva, Switzerland
3.  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IFPRI is indeed headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA. UNHCR's headquarters are correctly located in Geneva, Switzerland. However, GANHRI is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York, USA.  Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched. Option (b) is correct as it accurately identifies the headquarter locations of these organizations. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies, revealing a lack of awareness about the locations of these international organizations. This question assesses the candidate’s knowledge of the locations of key international organizations.


**6. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                      GHI Score/Rank
1.  India                                         100
2.  South Asia                                   27.0
3.  Africa South of the Sahara                   111
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's GHI rank in 2023 was 111, not 100.  South Asia's GHI score was indeed 27.0. Africa South of the Sahara also had a GHI score of 27.0.  Therefore, only the second and third pairs are correctly matched. Option (c) is correct as it accurately reflects the data from the GHI 2023 report. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain inaccuracies, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the GHI's rankings and scores. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the GHI report and its regional and country-specific data.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                    Key Feature/Provision
1.  MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021                       : Allows abortion up to 24 weeks for all women
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015  : Defines a child as a person below 16 years of age.
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Specifies a punishment of up to 5 years imprisonment.
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, while expanding access to abortion, does not allow it up to 24 weeks for *all* women; there are specific exceptions and conditions.  The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, defines a child as a person below 18 years of age.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment, not 5.  Only the first statement is partially correct, although the conditions for abortion are not fully stated. The other two statements are incorrect. Option (a) is chosen because it is the closest to being correct, although it does not fully capture the nuance of the MTP Act.  The question highlights the need for precise understanding of legal provisions.


**8. With reference to the  National Curriculum Framework (NCF) for School Education, consider the following pairs:**

   NCF Feature                                    Grade Levels
1.  Capacities for Scientific Inquiry                : Grades 1-5
2.  Environmental Education                       : Grades 6-8
3.  Separate subject of study for Interdisciplinary Areas : Grades 9-12
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCF emphasizes developing capacities for scientific inquiry across all stages of schooling.  Environmental education is also integrated throughout the schooling system, culminating in a separate area of study at the secondary level.  Interdisciplinary areas of study are also mentioned as a separate subject at the secondary stage.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is the correct answer since it accurately reflects the grade levels at which these features are emphasized.  The other options are incorrect, showing a lack of understanding of the NCF's approach to integrating these aspects into the school curriculum.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the NCF's structure and its approach towards different subjects.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Global Ranking Report                         Key Parameter
1.  Global 2000 Report, 2023                   : Academic Reputation
2.  QS World University Ranking, 2024           : Research Performance
3. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 : Employer Reputation
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global 2000 Report does not primarily focus on academic reputation; its parameters include quality of education, employability, faculty quality, and research performance.  The QS World University Ranking does consider research performance, but it is not the sole or primary parameter. Times Higher Education World University Rankings do consider employer reputation among its several parameters.  Only the second and third pairs are partially correct,  as the parameters mentioned are included in the respective rankings but not solely based on them. Option (c) is the best answer because it highlights the partial correctness of the pairs.  The other options are incorrect because they include pairs that are not completely accurate regarding the key parameters. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of different global university ranking methodologies.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Organization                           Mandate/Function
1.  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) :  Assessment of child suspects in heinous offences
2.  Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) :  Overseeing inter-country and intra-country adoptions
3.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) : Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCPCR indeed issued guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offences. CARA plays a crucial role in regulating both inter-country and intra-country adoptions.  The NCDNT is tasked with preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is correct because all three pairs accurately reflect the mandates and functions of the respective bodies. The other options are incorrect, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the roles and responsibilities of these organizations.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various commissions and their functions related to vulnerable groups.


**1. With reference to the Indian social landscape, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                     Headquarters
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) : Geneva, Switzerland
2. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Washington, D.C., USA
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA, not Geneva, Switzerland.  The UNHCR's headquarters are indeed in Geneva, Switzerland. The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is based in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York, USA. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The incorrect locations for IFPRI and GANHRI serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of these significant international organizations.  Understanding the locations of these organizations is crucial for comprehending their global reach and influence on international policy and development initiatives.  The question assesses factual recall and requires precise knowledge of the headquarters of these organizations, making it a moderately difficult question.


**2. With reference to Government Initiatives for Social Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                                      Key Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Focuses primarily on the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through financial assistance and alternate employment
2. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016   :  Mandates 10% reservation for PwDs in government jobs
3.  Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) : Aims to provide basic facilities to Scheduled Caste households

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, accurately focuses on the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, offering financial aid and alternative employment opportunities.  However, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates at least 4%, not 10%, reservation in government jobs for PwDs.  Furthermore, Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) targets Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), not Scheduled Castes.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect details regarding reservation percentages and target beneficiaries for PM JANMAN creates effective distractors, challenging the candidate's detailed understanding of these acts and schemes. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar social welfare programs, making it a moderately difficult question.


**3. With reference to the Indian Education System, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Framework                                   Key Provision
1. National Credit Framework (NCrF)              :  Divides education into 6 levels, integrating school, higher, and vocational education credits
2. National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) :  Retains the existing four-stage schooling structure
3.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023 :  Repeals the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Act

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Credit Framework (NCrF) actually divides education into 8 levels, not 6, seamlessly integrating credits from school, higher, and vocational education. The NCF-SE proposes a new 5+3+3+4 structure, replacing the older four-stage system. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, repealed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008, not the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Act. All three pairs contain inaccuracies, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of these educational frameworks and acts. The question tests factual recall and understanding of education policy reforms, making it a difficult question.


**4. With reference to Vulnerable Groups in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Group                                              Key Characteristic
1. De-notified Tribes (DNTs)                         :  Designated as "criminal tribes" under British rule
2. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)    :  Highest concentration in Odisha
3.  Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)                 :  Reservation of 5% in all government jobs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

De-notified Tribes (DNTs) were indeed categorized as "criminal tribes" during British rule.  Odisha does, in fact, have the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). However, the reservation for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in government jobs is at least 4%, not 5%.  The inclusion of a nearly correct but ultimately false statement regarding PwD reservation serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's ability to recall precise details. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the characteristics of vulnerable groups, making it a moderately difficult question.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Index                                        Key Publisher/Organization
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                         : Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
2. Global Gender Gap Index                           :  United Nations Development Programme
3.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report : World Health Organization and World Bank


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is correctly attributed to Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.  However, the Global Gender Gap Index is published by the World Economic Forum, not the United Nations Development Programme. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report is published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), not the World Health Organization and World Bank.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect publishers for the Gender Gap Index and SDG report makes this a challenging question. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the sources of key reports and indices related to social development, making it a moderately difficult question.


**6. With reference to International Organizations, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                   Mandate/Focus
1. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)      : Primarily focused on combating hunger and food insecurity
2. World Food Programme (WFP)                 :  Works to ensure sexual and reproductive health rights
3.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) :  Protects refugees and assists those fleeing persecution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA's focus is on sexual and reproductive health, not combating hunger. The WFP's mandate is indeed to address hunger and food insecurity. The UNHCR accurately works to protect refugees and assist those fleeing persecution.  The misattribution of mandates for UNFPA creates a strong distractor, requiring precise knowledge of the organizations' functions.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the roles of international organizations in global development, making it a moderately difficult question.


**7. With reference to Indian Social Issues, consider the following pairs:**

    Issue                                             Legislation/Act
1. Surrogacy                                      :  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
2. Abortion                                         :  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971
3. Child Trafficking                               :  Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, directly addresses surrogacy.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, governs abortion. However, the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, while relevant to child exploitation, is not the primary legislation addressing child trafficking.  Other acts, such as the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, are more directly involved in combating child trafficking.  The inclusion of a related but incorrect act regarding child trafficking serves as a strong distractor.  The question tests factual recall and the candidate's knowledge of legislation related to social issues, making it a moderately difficult question.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme                                     Target Beneficiary
1. Saksham Anganwadis                               :  Children aged 0-6 years
2. Intensified Mission Indradhanush                   :  Pregnant women and children aged 0-5 years
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED):  De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Saksham Anganwadis, as part of the broader Anganwadi system, directly target children aged 0-6 years.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on immunizing pregnant women and children aged 0-5 years. The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is specifically designed for De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes.  All three pairs are correctly matched, making this a relatively easier question compared to the others, but still requiring accurate recall of government schemes and their beneficiaries.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to link government schemes to their target populations.


**9. With reference to the Indian Constitution and its provisions, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Provision                                  Subject Matter
1. Entry 33, List II (State List)                          :  Sports
2. Entry 69 of the Union List                             : Census
3. Article 342                                          : Scheduled Castes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Entry 33, List II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution correctly deals with sports. Entry 69 of the Union List correctly places the Census under the Union's purview.  However, Article 342 defines Scheduled Tribes, not Scheduled Castes.  The inclusion of an almost correct but inaccurate statement related to Article 342 adds a layer of difficulty.  The question tests factual recall and knowledge of the Indian Constitution's structure and its allocation of powers, making it a moderately difficult question.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                             :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                              :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                               :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4.  Highest number of PVTGs                 :   Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  However, the provided information indicates that Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga are found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making options 1 and 2 partially incorrect. Option 3 is incorrect because Andaman and Nicobar Islands is not mentioned in association with these tribes. Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs in India, making option 4 correct. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.

(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Forest Rights Act, 2006, grants forest dwellers, including PVTGs, rights over forest land and resources, including habitat rights, thus making pair 1 correct. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, making pair 2 correct. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly bans manual scavenging, making pair 3 correct.  However, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, does *not* include reservation for PwDs in police forces, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for tribal welfare, making pair 2 correct. International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed annually on August 9th, making pair 3 correct. However, the criteria for identifying PVTGs (Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups) includes a pre-agricultural level of technology, not pre-industrial, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to De-notified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Concept                               :   Description
1.  DNTs                                        :   All are nomadic tribes

(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Not all DNTs are nomadic tribes; some may be settled communities, making statement 1 incorrect. Vimukta Jatis Day is celebrated on August 31st by DNT communities, making statement 2 correct. The NCDNT is tasked with preparing a state-wise list of DNT castes, making statement 3 correct. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group, not a hunter-gatherer community, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5.  With reference to Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Provision                               :   Characteristic
1.  RPwD Act, 2016                           :   Recognizes 21 types of disabilities

(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCLP scheme falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development, making pair 1 incorrect. Swachhta Udyami Yojana is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, making pair 2 correct. Ayushman Bharat Yojana is correctly linked to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, making pair 3 correct. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 is implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The MTP Act primarily regulates abortion, making pair 1 correct. The 2013 Act addresses workplace sexual harassment, making pair 2 correct. The Juvenile Justice Act deals with the care and protection of children, including aspects of adoption, making pair 3 correct. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act does not focus on surrogacy; that is covered by the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                                      State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                              :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                               :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                                :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  However, the provided pairings are intentionally misleading. While the Baiga tribe is indeed a PVTG, it is found in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, not the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  The Kamar tribe is a PVTG found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Bharia tribe is also a PVTG found in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes one correct pairing. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes an incorrectly matched pair (Baiga PVTG with Andaman and Nicobar Islands). Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair involving the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Understanding the geographical distribution of PVTGs is crucial for comprehending India's tribal demographics and the challenges faced by these communities.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

    Criterion for Identifying PVTGs           Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology     :  High literacy rates
2. Low level of literacy                    :   High level of economic development
3. Declining or stagnant population         :    Self-sufficient economy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural levels of technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  The pairs are designed to be confusing. Pair 1 is incorrect because PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural technology, implying low technological advancement, not high literacy. Pair 2 is also incorrect; low literacy is a defining characteristic of PVTGs, contrasting with high economic development.  Pair 3 is correctly matched because a declining or stagnant population is indeed a criterion for PVTG identification.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs that misrepresent the characteristics of PVTGs.  Understanding these criteria is vital for comprehending the unique vulnerabilities and challenges faced by these groups.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Nomadic Community                     Characteristic
1. Hakki Pikki Tribe                      :   Hunter/Trapper community
2. Konda Reddis                           :   Semi-nomadic group from Karnataka
3. Gujjar                                  :   Peripatetic group of peddlers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge about nomadic and semi-nomadic communities in India.  The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group primarily from Karnataka, making pair 1 incorrect. The Konda Reddis are a hunter-gatherer community, not a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka, making pair 2 incorrect. The Gujjars are a pastoral community, often associated with animal husbandry, not primarily peddlers, making pair 3 incorrect. However, the Gujjars are a pastoral community, while Konda Reddis are a hunter-gatherer community. Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because it includes an incorrectly matched pair. Option (b) is incorrect because it includes incorrectly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes all incorrectly matched pairs.  Understanding the diverse livelihoods and characteristics of nomadic communities is crucial for formulating effective welfare policies.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Disability                        Provision
1. Intellectual Disability                 :   Exemption from reservation in police forces
2. Acid Attack Victims                     :   Free education for children aged 6-18
3. Benchmark Disability (>=40% disability) :   No reservation in government jobs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.  The Act mandates reservations in government jobs and higher educational institutions for persons with benchmark disabilities (at least 40% disability), and it explicitly excludes police forces from this reservation.  Free education for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18 is also a provision.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Act does not exempt individuals with intellectual disabilities from reservation policies. Pair 2 is correct; the Act provides for free education. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Act does mandate reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities. Thus, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs that misrepresent the provisions of the Act.  Understanding the provisions of the Act is crucial for ensuring the rights and inclusion of persons with disabilities.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act Related to Manual Scavenging      Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Punishment of up to 5 years imprisonment
2.  NAMASTE Scheme                         :    Focuses solely on solid waste management
3. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                 :   Provides concessional loans for sanitation equipment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prohibits manual scavenging and provides for rehabilitation.  The punishment is up to 2 years imprisonment and a fine of up to ₹1 lakh, not 5 years. The NAMASTE scheme aims for 100% mechanization of sanitation, encompassing both solid and liquid waste management. Swachhta Udyami Yojana does provide concessional loans for sanitation equipment. Pair 1 is therefore incorrect due to the inaccurate punishment detail. Pair 2 is incorrect because NAMASTE's scope is broader than just solid waste management. Pair 3 is correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs misrepresenting the schemes and the Act's provisions. Understanding these initiatives is essential for addressing the issue of manual scavenging effectively.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

    Educational Aspect                     Feature
1. Curriculum Framework                  :   Based on a 4+3+3+4 age-based structure
2. Board Examinations                     :    Students allowed only one attempt per year
3. Multilingualism and Indian Languages  :   Proficiency in at least two languages, one of which must be a foreign language

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE is based on a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure, not 4+3+3+4, making pair 1 incorrect.  The NCF-SE allows students to take board examinations on at least two occasions during a school year, not just one, making pair 2 incorrect.  The NCF-SE promotes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages, not just two with one foreign language, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect as it includes an incorrectly matched pair. Option (b) is incorrect as it includes incorrectly matched pairs. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes incorrectly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes all incorrectly matched pairs. A thorough understanding of the NCF-SE is crucial for analyzing its impact on the Indian education system.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization Related to Higher Education     Function/Initiative
1. UGC                                        :   Oversees the National Accreditation Council (NAC)
2.  National Medical Commission (NMC)       :   Accredits nursing colleges exclusively
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)      :   Focuses solely on humanities research

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The University Grants Commission (UGC) plays a key role in regulating higher education in India, and it does oversee the National Accreditation Council (NAC). The NMC's purview extends beyond nursing colleges to encompass medical education and practice overall. The NRF's mandate is broader than just humanities research; it encompasses various scientific and technological fields. Pair 1 is correctly matched because the UGC does oversee the NAC. Pair 2 is incorrect because the NMC's accreditation extends beyond nursing colleges. Pair 3 is incorrect because the NRF's scope is not limited to humanities research. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.  An understanding of these organizations and their roles is crucial for analyzing the higher education landscape in India.


**8. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Index, consider the following pairs:**

    Index                                     Parameter
1. Global Gender Gap Index               :   Measures only economic participation and opportunity
2. Gender Social Norms Index              :   Includes a dimension on political empowerment
3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) :  Tracks SDG 3.8.1 related to health

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) encompasses various parameters beyond economic participation, including educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. The Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI) indeed includes a dimension on political empowerment. The UHC SCI does track SDG 3.8.1, which is related to health. Pair 1 is incorrect because the GGGI includes more parameters than just economic participation. Pair 2 is correctly matched because the GSNI does include political empowerment. Pair 3 is correctly matched because the UHC SCI tracks SDG 3.8.1.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.  Understanding these indices is vital for analyzing gender equality and health outcomes globally and in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                      State/UT
1. Bharia                             :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar                             :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga                              :   Andaman & Nicobar Islands
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is indeed listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Chhattisgarh.  However, the other pairings are incorrect. While the Kamar and Baiga tribes are also categorized as PVTGs, they are primarily associated with Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, not exclusively with Madhya Pradesh or Andaman & Nicobar Islands.  The Andaman & Nicobar Islands have their own distinct PVTG populations. The question tests the examinee's knowledge of the geographical distribution of specific PVTGs across India, highlighting the complexity of tribal demographics and challenging assumptions based on partial knowledge.  The inclusion of Andaman & Nicobar Islands as a distractor adds a layer of difficulty, forcing candidates to have precise knowledge rather than relying on general awareness.  This emphasizes the need for detailed study of Indian tribal groups beyond broad generalizations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                         Ministry/Organization
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) :  Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) : Ministry of Rural Development
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. This ministry is responsible for the welfare and rehabilitation of manual scavengers.  However, the other options are incorrect. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is not under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs; its function is related to welfare of DNTs, which is handled by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Similarly, the Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is also a program of the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Rural Development. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the governmental structure responsible for addressing social justice issues in India and the specific ministries involved.  The incorrect options provide plausible distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the relevant ministries and their responsibilities.  It highlights the need for a detailed understanding of government schemes and their administrative frameworks.


**3. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs              Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology      :   Use of advanced farming techniques
2. Low level of literacy                     :   High rates of school enrollment
3. Economic backwardness                 :   High per capita income
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are the opposite of what is given in the options.  PVTGs are characterized by a pre-agricultural level of technology (meaning they haven't adopted advanced farming), low literacy rates, and significant economic backwardness (low per capita income). The options deliberately offer contrasting descriptions to test a candidate's precise understanding of the defining characteristics of PVTGs.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to identify and understand the criteria used to classify tribal groups as particularly vulnerable. The use of contradictory descriptions acts as a strong distractor, emphasizing the need for accurate factual recall and the ability to differentiate between characteristics of a PVTG and those of a more developed community.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                   Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs          :   Minimum 2% reservation
2. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities :  Age group 6-15 years
3. Recognition of disabilities                :   18 types of disabilities recognized
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the given pairs are incorrectly matched. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs, not 2%.  Free education is provided for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18 years, not just 6-15 years. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 18. This question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act.  The incorrect options serve as strong distractors, testing the candidate's accuracy in recalling specific details of the Act.  The question highlights the importance of precise knowledge about legislation related to the rights of persons with disabilities and the need to avoid generalizations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Report/Index
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) : Global Gender Gap Index
2. World Economic Forum                       : Global Food Policy Report
3. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) : Gender Social Norms Index
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) indeed releases the Gender Social Norms Index.  The other pairings are incorrect.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) publishes the Global Food Policy Report, not the Global Gender Gap Index. The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index, not the Global Food Policy Report. The question tests the candidate's ability to link organizations with their specific publications and reports, requiring precise knowledge of the roles and outputs of various international organizations.  The incorrect options act as effective distractors, highlighting the need for accurate and specific knowledge rather than general awareness.  The question showcases the importance of understanding the sources of key development indicators and reports.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                           Mandate/Focus Area
1. UNFPA                               :   Combating hunger
2. WFP                                  :  Sexual and reproductive health
3. UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA): Sustainable Development Goals
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) is indeed focused on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The first two pairs are incorrect. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) focuses on sexual and reproductive health, not combating hunger, which is the mandate of the World Food Programme (WFP).  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the mandates and activities of various UN organizations.  The incorrect options provide plausible distractors, ensuring that candidates possess a specific understanding of the roles of these organizations.  The question underlines the importance of distinguishing between the functions of different UN agencies.


**7.  With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                    Detail
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target       :  Reach 100% by 2035 for higher education
2.  Multiple exit options in Undergraduate degrees   :  Diploma after the first year
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)      :  Focus on school education
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched.  The NEP 2020 does indeed offer multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees, including a diploma after the first year.  The other options are incorrect. The NEP 2020 targets a GER of at least 50% for higher education by 2035, not 100%. The National Research Foundation (NRF) is focused on higher education and research, not school education. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the key features of the NEP 2020, requiring a detailed knowledge of its provisions. The incorrect options are plausible distractors, ensuring that the candidate possesses a precise understanding of the policy's goals and initiatives.  This question highlights the importance of detailed knowledge of educational policies and their implications.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                             Key Feature
1.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023 :  Repeals the SERB Act, 2008
2.  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 : Allows less than 20-year-old institutions to apply for DtbU status
3.  UGC [Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India] Regulations, 2023 :  Allows online programs for FHEIs
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The first and second pairs are correctly matched. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, does repeal the SERB Act, 2008, and the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, do allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for Deemed-to-be-University status.  The third pair is incorrect. The UGC regulations for foreign higher educational institutions do *not* allow online programs.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of recent changes in higher education regulations in India.  The incorrect option serves as a plausible distractor, requiring the candidate to have precise knowledge of the regulations' details.  This question emphasizes the importance of understanding the nuances of recent legislation affecting higher education.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Ministry/Organization
1. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                    :   Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
2. National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) :   Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0        :    Ministry of Women and Child Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Swachhta Udyami Yojana, a scheme providing concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  NAMASTE, focused on mechanized sanitation, is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  Finally, Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, a revamped Anganwadi Services Scheme, is implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                        Releasing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index                      :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index                    :   World Economic Forum
3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) :   World Health Organization and World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is published annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. The Gender Social Norms Index is indeed released by the UNDP. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) is a joint publication of the World Health Organization and the World Bank. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either misattribute the releasing organization or include incorrectly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Key Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021             :   Allows commercial surrogacy
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :   Allows abortion up to 24 weeks for all women
3. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Imposes a fine of up to ₹50,000 for violations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women, with certain exceptions extending the limit to 24 weeks under specific circumstances.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, prescribes a much higher penalty—a fine of up to ₹1 lakh, not ₹50,000.  Therefore, only the third pair is partially correct (the fine amount is incorrect). Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                         :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
2. UNHCR                                         :   India Ageing Report 2023
3. IFPRI                                          :   Global Food Policy Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) produces reports like the State of World Population report, not the UNHCR's "Global Trends" report.  The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) publishes reports on refugee situations, not reports on aging in India.  The IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) does indeed release the Global Food Policy Report.  Therefore, only the third pair is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Implementing Ministry
1. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020          :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2. Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023 :   Ministry of Education
3. National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) :   Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 is implemented by the Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, is also under the Ministry of Education. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) is also under the Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports.  Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                             Function/Report
1.  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) :   Issues guidelines for assessment of child suspects in heinous offences.
2.  Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) :   Conducts caste surveys.
3.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)   :   Reviews and monitors implementation of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCPCR does indeed issue guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offenses under the Juvenile Justice Act. CARA is responsible for regulating adoptions, not caste surveys.  The National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB), not the NHRC, reviews and monitors the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021. Therefore, only the first pair is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative/Program               Focus Area
1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                       :   Mechanized sanitation
2. Intensified Mission Indradhanush              :   Universal Health Coverage
3.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system:   Childhood immunization

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a health insurance scheme, not related to mechanized sanitation. Intensified Mission Indradhanush is a program to improve childhood immunization coverage, contributing to Universal Health Coverage goals. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system directly addresses mechanized sanitation. Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**8. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Designation                                 Key Responsibility/Benefit
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)                    :   Receives task-based incentives only.
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)                :   Works under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA)    :   Focuses on promotion of maternal and child health.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

AWWs receive both a fixed honorarium and performance-linked incentives. ANMs are employed under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. ASHAs play a crucial role in promoting maternal and child health. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**9. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   GHI Aspect                                 Value/Characteristic
1. India's GHI rank in 2023                     :   Among the lowest globally.
2.  India's GHI score in 2023                    :  Categorized as "Serious" on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale.
3.  GHI Releasing Organizations                  :   World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India's GHI rank in 2023 was significantly higher than the lowest globally, indicating a concerning level of hunger. India's GHI score in 2023 did fall into the "Serious" category. The GHI is not released by the World Bank or IMF, but by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.  Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**10. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   NCrF Aspect                                    Description
1.  Levels 1-4                                   :   Higher education
2.  Levels 4.5-8                                  :   Vocational education and training
3.  Integration of earned credits                 :   Exclusively through higher education institutions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) None
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Levels 1-4 in the NCrF correspond to school education, not higher education. Levels 4.5-8 encompass higher education, but also include vocational education and training.  Credit integration happens through various educational pathways, not solely higher education institutions.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                     Headquarters

The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is headquartered in New York, USA. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.  This question tests factual recall of the headquarters of international organizations, a common theme in UPSC examinations. Understanding the locations of these organizations helps in analyzing their global reach and influence.


**2. With reference to the reports released by international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

Report                                             Organization
1. Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report : World Food Programme (WFP)
2. Global Food Policy Report 2023                    : International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
3. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023 : UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
4. India Ageing Report 2023                           : United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only

The UNHCR released the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report". The IFPRI released the "Global Food Policy Report 2023". UNDESA released the "Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023". The UNFPA released the "India Ageing Report 2023" in collaboration with IIPS.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of the India Ageing Report. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly paired WFP report. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly paired WFP report. This question tests the ability to link reports with their respective releasing organizations, a skill crucial for understanding global development issues and policy analysis, frequently tested in the UPSC exam.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy                                          Key Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021                : Allows commercial surrogacy
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 : Allows termination up to 24 weeks in specific cases
3. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 : Defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse
4. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:  Bans manual scavenging with exceptions for those using protective gear.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, allows only altruistic surrogacy, not commercial surrogacy. The MTP Act, 1971, allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks in specific cases, as amended in 2021. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, defines domestic violence broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, bans manual scavenging but includes exceptions for those using appropriate protective gear and equipment.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests knowledge of various acts related to social issues and their key provisions, a common area of focus in UPSC exams.  Understanding these laws is essential for analyzing social policies and their impact.


**4. With reference to the organizations working for vulnerable sections, consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                   Area of Focus
1. National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) :  Welfare of De-notified Tribes
2. National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT): Child Rights
3. Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD              : Rights of Persons with Disabilities

**Explanation:**

The NCPCR focuses on child rights. The NCDNT focuses on the welfare of De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes. The Office of the Chief Commissioner of PwD focuses on the rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs focuses on the welfare of Scheduled Tribes. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question assesses the understanding of the mandates of various organizations working for vulnerable sections of society.  Knowledge of these organizations is crucial for analyzing government policies and their effectiveness in addressing social issues.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Scheme/Initiative                                     Implementing Ministry
1.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme      : Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3.  Saksham Anganwadis                             : Ministry of Labour and Employment
4.  SMILE (Support for Marginalised Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise) : Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA, not Rome, Italy.  Rome, Italy is the headquarters of the World Food Programme (WFP).  The UNHCR is correctly paired with Geneva, Switzerland. The GANHRI is also headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, not Washington D.C. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is correctly matched with New York, USA. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall of the headquarters of international organizations, which is a common element in UPSC examinations.  Understanding the locations of these organizations helps in understanding their global reach and influence.

2.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) : Global Food Policy Report 2023
3.  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) : State of World Population Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Food Programme (WFP) is known for its reports on food crises, not for the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report," which is associated with the UNHCR.  The IFPRI correctly publishes the Global Food Policy Report.  The UNDESA publishes various reports, including the World Social Report and others on sustainable development, but the "State of World Population Report 2023" is primarily associated with the UNFPA. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include pairs linked to reports published by different organizations. This question tests the knowledge of key publications from various international organizations dealing with issues related to food security, population, and development, which are frequently discussed in the UPSC context.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Mandate/Focus Area

3.  UNFPA                                        :  Saving lives, protecting rights, and building a better future for forcibly displaced people
4.  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC): Ensuring sexual and reproductive rights and choices for all

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR's mandate focuses on protecting the rights of refugees and other forcibly displaced individuals, not on poverty reduction, which is a key focus of IFPRI and other organizations. The IFPRI's primary focus is on research-based policy solutions for reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, not on protecting the rights of refugees. The UNFPA's mandate accurately reflects its work on sexual and reproductive health and rights. The UNCRC's mandate accurately describes its role in monitoring the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options include inaccurate pairings, testing the candidate's understanding of the core functions of each organization.  This is crucial for UPSC aspirants as it shows the ability to connect organizations with their specific areas of work.


**4. With reference to the 2023 reports released by various UN agencies, consider the following pairs:**

   Report Title                                         Releasing Agency
1.  Global Food Policy Report 2023                  : UNDESA
2.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: IFPRI

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Food Policy Report 2023 is published by IFPRI, not UNDESA.  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023 is released by UNDESA, not IFPRI.  The UNHCR accurately releases the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report". Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  This question tests the knowledge of recent UN reports and the agencies responsible for their release.  Understanding the source of these reports is essential for analyzing their findings and implications accurately, a crucial skill for UPSC aspirants.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                  Population Trend/Statistic (as per UNFPA report 2023)
1.  China                                    : Most populous country by mid-2023
2.  India                                     :  Around 68% of population in the age group 10-24 years
3.  Egypt                                     : One of eight countries projected to provide more than 50% of global population by 2050

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While India surpassed China's population by mid-2023, making statement 1 correct, the UNFPA report states around 68% of India's population falls within the 15-64 age group, not 10-24 years.  Egypt is correctly identified as one of the eight countries projected to contribute significantly to global population growth by 2050. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The other options incorrectly include the mismatched pair about India's age demographics.  This question tests the ability to understand and interpret data from demographic reports, a critical skill for comprehending current global trends.  UPSC often tests knowledge of population dynamics and their implications.


**6. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and its implementation, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                                  Implementing Agency/Body

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF is a joint initiative involving multiple agencies, including UGC, AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, and Ministries of Education and Skill Development, not solely NCERT. The NRF is established under the Ministry of Education, making statement 2 correct. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is indeed implemented under the umbrella of the UGC. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests the knowledge of the NEP 2020's key features and the agencies responsible for their implementation.  A strong understanding of the NEP 2020 and its mechanisms is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Key Provision/Feature

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, correctly bans this practice. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, accurately recognizes 21 types of disabilities. The National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) correctly aims to reduce stunting in high-malnutrition areas.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. This question evaluates understanding of key social welfare legislations and policies in India.  Knowledge of these policies and their provisions is critical for UPSC preparation.


**8. With reference to the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

  State                                     Feature related to SCs/STs
1.  Madhya Pradesh                          : Highest absolute number of STs
2.  Odisha                                   : Highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
3.  Bihar                                    :  Highest percentage of SC population

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Madhya Pradesh correctly has the highest absolute number of STs. Odisha correctly houses the highest number of PVTGs. However, the state with the highest percentage of SC population is not Bihar.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of the demographic distribution of SCs and STs across different Indian states.  Understanding this distribution is important for analyzing social inequalities and the effectiveness of government policies aimed at uplifting these communities.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                           State/Region
1. Bharia                           Madhya Pradesh
2. Kamar                            Chhattisgarh
3. Baiga                            Odisha
4. Hakki Pikki                       Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe is indeed recognized as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Madhya Pradesh.  The Kamar and Baiga tribes are also correctly listed as PVTGs, but their presence extends to both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making options (a) and (b) incomplete. Odisha is also home to a significant number of PVTGs, but the Baiga tribe is not exclusively located there.  The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group primarily residing in Karnataka, making option (c) the most accurate.  Option (d) is incorrect because while three of the pairs are partially correct, the inclusion of Baiga solely with Odisha is inaccurate. The question tests factual recall and the ability to analyze the distribution of tribal groups across different states, highlighting the complexities and nuances of tribal demographics in India.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group Category       Criterion
1. PVTGs                        Pre-industrial level of technology
2. Scheduled Tribes (STs)        Declining population
3. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)   Economic backwardness

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The criteria for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) include a pre-agricultural (or pre-industrial) level of technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  Therefore, the pairing of PVTGs with pre-industrial technology is accurate.  While declining populations can be a characteristic of some Scheduled Tribes and Denotified Tribes, it's not a defining criterion for their categorization. Economic backwardness is a common characteristic of many marginalized groups, including DNTs, but again, it is not the sole or defining criterion.  The other options are incorrect because they incorrectly associate criteria with tribal categories. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the criteria used to classify different tribal groups within India's social structure, highlighting the complexities of categorizing vulnerable populations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Key Provision
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Demolition of insanitary latrines
2.  Forest Rights Act, 2006                       :  Habitat rights for PVTGs
3.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :  4% reservation in government jobs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines and the provision of alternative employment for manual scavengers. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, grants habitat rights to forest-dwelling tribal communities, including PVTGs. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, reserves at least 4% of government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities. All three pairs are correctly matched, highlighting the legal frameworks aimed at protecting vulnerable sections of society.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to connect specific legislation with their key provisions, demonstrating knowledge of social welfare policies in India.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Initiative             Ministry
1.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP)      Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)         Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) : Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) is indeed under the Ministry of Jal Shakti (formerly Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation). The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is correctly linked to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the administrative structure of government schemes, demonstrating knowledge of the allocation of responsibilities among different ministries.

2.  Saksham Anganwadis                  Digital strengthening of AWCs
3.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush       Reaching zero-dose children

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) aims to improve the utilization of Anganwadi services to reduce malnutrition. Saksham Anganwadis focus on strengthening AWCs, including digital enhancements.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets children who have missed vaccine doses. All three pairs accurately reflect the goals and activities of these programs within the context of the Anganwadi system.  This question assesses factual recall and the ability to link specific programs with their objectives within a larger social welfare initiative, demonstrating an understanding of India's approach to child health and nutrition.


**6. With reference to  Government initiatives to boost R&D in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Ministry/Department

   Aspect                                        Feature
1.  Curriculum Framework                      5+3+3+4 age-based design
2. Board Examinations                         Multiple attempts allowed
3.  Multilingualism                             Proficiency in at least two Indian languages

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE indeed adopts a 5+3+3+4 age-based design for schooling.  The framework also allows for multiple attempts at board examinations. However, the NCF-SE promotes proficiency in at least *three* languages, not just two, with at least two being Indian languages. Thus, only the first two pairs are completely accurate. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between the stated features and the actual implemented features of the NCF-SE, highlighting the attention to detail required for understanding educational policy.


**8. With reference to the  Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

3. Child Wasting                              18.7%
4.  Adult Mortality Rate                     3.1%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2023 report for India cites approximately 16.6% undernourishment, 35.5% child stunting, and 18.7% child wasting. However, the GHI uses Child Mortality Rate (under 5), not adult mortality rate.  Therefore, only the first three pairs are correctly matched. The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between similar indicators within a specific report, highlighting the importance of precise understanding of data presented in international development reports.


**9. With reference to the  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                     Value (Approximate)
1. India's Population (mid-2023)                 1428.6 million
2. Percentage of India's population aged 15-64   68%
3. Total Fertility Rate in India                    2.0
4. Life Expectancy of Indian Male                  74 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA report accurately states India's population around mid-2023 as approximately 1428.6 million,  the percentage of the population aged 15-64 years as around 68%, and the total fertility rate as approximately 2.0. However, the life expectancy of an Indian male is approximately 71 years, not 74 years, as stated in the UNFPA report.  Therefore, only the first three pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests factual recall from a specific international report, highlighting the need for accuracy in interpreting demographic data.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Mandate/Focus
1.  UN Committee on Rights of the Child (UNCRC)   Children's right to live in a clean environment
2.  World Food Programme (WFP)                   Combating hunger
3.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI): Reducing poverty and malnutrition
4.  UNHCR                                         Protecting refugees

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Committee on Rights of the Child (UNCRC) issued guidance on children's right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. The World Food Programme (WFP) is focused on combating hunger. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) works on reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. The UNHCR's mandate is to protect refugees. All three pairs accurately represent the mandates of these organizations.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the roles and functions of international organizations working in the areas of human rights, food security, and refugee protection.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                    State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                           :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                            :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                             :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
4.  Hakki Pikki Tribe                     :   Karnataka


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic tribal group primarily residing in Karnataka.  The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have their own unique indigenous populations, but the Baiga tribe is not primarily associated with that Union Territory. Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrect pairings of tribes and their primary locations.  Understanding the geographical distribution of tribal groups in India is crucial for comprehending the complexities of tribal welfare and development initiatives.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify correct pairings from a list of plausible but ultimately incorrect options.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs           Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology     :   Use of advanced farming techniques
2. Low level of literacy                    :   High rates of school enrollment
3. Economic backwardness                 :   High per capita income
4. Declining or stagnant population       :   Rapid population growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the given pairs are incorrectly matched.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural levels of technology (meaning a reliance on traditional methods rather than advanced techniques), low literacy rates (not high enrollment), economic backwardness (low per capita income), and a declining or stagnant population (not rapid growth).  These criteria reflect the vulnerability and marginalization of PVTGs. The question assesses factual recall of the defining characteristics of PVTGs and the ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect descriptions. The inclusion of seemingly plausible but inaccurate descriptions makes the question challenging.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Focus
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Promoting commercial surrogacy
2. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021           :   Regulating altruistic surrogacy
3. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Eliminating manual scavenging
4.  National Food Security Act, 2013           :  Providing food security


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, focuses on regulating altruistic surrogacy, while the National Food Security Act, 2013, aims to provide food security to a significant portion of the Indian population. The other options incorrectly pair the Acts/Policies with their respective focuses. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to eliminate manual scavenging, not promote commercial surrogacy.  Similarly, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, is concerned with the rights and welfare of persons with disabilities, not manual scavenging elimination directly. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various legislations and their specific objectives, requiring both factual recall and an understanding of the policy landscape. The inclusion of distractors that are close in theme but not in focus makes this a challenging question.


**4. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                              Implementation Detail
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)              :   Target of 50% by 2025
2. Multiple exit options                      :   Only Bachelor's degrees offered
3. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)             :   Digital storage of academic credits
4. National Research Foundation (NRF)      :   To restrict research funding


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The NEP 2020 aims for a 50% GER in higher education by 2035, not 2025.  Multiple exit options allow for diplomas and degrees at different stages of undergraduate education.  The ABC is indeed designed for digital storage of academic credits. The NRF is intended to promote and support research, not restrict it.  This question tests knowledge of specific details within the NEP 2020, requiring precise recall of policy features and their implementation details.  The inclusion of incorrect years and mischaracterizations of policy goals makes this a difficult question.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                              Primary Focus
1. UNFPA                                    :   Combating hunger globally
2. World Food Programme (WFP)            :   Promoting sexual and reproductive health
3. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Food policy research
4.  UNICEF                                  : Providing humanitarian aid to children


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The IFPRI conducts research on food policy, and UNICEF provides humanitarian aid to children.  The UNFPA focuses on sexual and reproductive health, not combating hunger, and the WFP's main focus is on combating hunger, not sexual and reproductive health. The question tests knowledge of different international organizations and their mandates, requiring both factual recall and an understanding of their roles in global development.  The strategically placed incorrect pairings of organizations and their focuses make this a difficult question, requiring careful consideration of each option.


**6. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                   Measurement in India (Approximate)
1. Undernourishment                          :   Below 5%
2. Child Stunting                             :   Above 40%
3. Child Wasting                              :   Below 10%
4. Child Mortality                             :   Below 2%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair related to Child Stunting is somewhat correctly matched.  India's child stunting rate is significantly higher than 40% according to recent GHI reports. The other indicators have different values. Undernourishment is higher than 5%, child wasting is higher than 10%, and child mortality is higher than 2%.  The question tests knowledge of GHI indicators and their approximate values for India, requiring both factual recall and an understanding of the challenges of malnutrition.  The use of approximate figures and the inclusion of plausible yet incorrect values for the other indicators make this a challenging question that demands precise knowledge.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislation                                    Key Provision
1. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines age of consent as 16
2. POCSO Act, 2012                             :   Protects children from sexual offenses
3. Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956      :   Addresses bonded labor
4.  Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 :   Prohibits immoral trafficking


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The POCSO Act, 2012, protects children from sexual offenses, and the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, addresses bonded labor. The Juvenile Justice Act defines the age of a child, not the age of consent (which is 18 according to other legislation), and the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, prohibits immoral trafficking, not bonded labor. This question tests knowledge of different Acts related to child protection and vulnerable sections, requiring precise recall of the provisions of each Act.  The inclusion of distractors that are related to child protection but not directly relevant to the specific Act makes this question difficult.


**8. With reference to the Anganwadi System, consider the following pairs:**

   Worker Category                          Key Responsibility
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)                 :   Providing curative healthcare
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)          :   Early childhood care and development
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) :   Promoting maternal and child health


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair concerning ASHAs is correctly matched. ASHAs play a key role in promoting maternal and child health. AWWs primarily focus on early childhood care and development, while ANMs provide curative healthcare and other services. This question tests knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of different community health workers within the Anganwadi system, requiring accurate recall of their functions.  The deliberate mismatching of responsibilities among the different worker categories makes this a challenging question that requires precise knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                      State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                      :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                       :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                        :   Odisha
4.  Highest number of PVTGs        :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are indeed recognized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). However, their distribution across states is crucial.  Bharia and Baiga are listed as PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making statement 1 partially correct and statement 3 incorrect. The Kamar tribe is also found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs in India (13), making statement 3 incorrect. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have PVTGs, but not the highest number, thus statement 4 is incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are partially correctly matched.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs        Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology  :   High level of literacy
2. Low level of literacy                :   Economic advancement
3. Declining or stagnant population     :   High population density

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs include a pre-agricultural level of technology, a low level of literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  The descriptions provided in the pairs are the opposites of the actual criteria. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  Nomadic/Semi-Nomadic Tribe    Characteristic
1. Hakki Pikki Tribe               :   Hunter/trapper community
2. Konda Reddis                    :   Semi-nomadic tribal group from Karnataka
3. Pardis                          :   Peripatetic group of peddlers
4. Chenchus                       : Pastoral communities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Hakki Pikki Tribe is a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka, not a hunter-trapper community (making pair 1 incorrect).  The Konda Reddis are indeed a hunter-gatherer community, not a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka (making pair 2 incorrect). Pardis are indeed peripatetic groups of peddlers, making pair 3 correct.  Chenchus are primarily pastoral communities, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                   Feature
1. Reservation in Government jobs          :   Not less than 5% reservation in higher educational institutions
2. Reservation in higher educational institutions :   Not less than 4% reservation in Government jobs
3. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities:    Applies to children aged 6-18 years.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Act mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities (making pair 1 incorrect).  It also specifies not less than 5% reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions (making pair 2 incorrect).  The Act does provide for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18 (making pair 3 correct). Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Note that the reservation does not apply to police forces.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Act Related to Manual Scavenging              Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Allows for the construction of insanitary latrines.
2.  PEMSR                                       :   Mandates building and maintaining community sanitary latrines.
3.  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system   :   Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) explicitly prohibits the construction of insanitary latrines and mandates the demolition or conversion of existing ones (making pair 1 incorrect). It also mandates the building and maintaining of community sanitary latrines (making pair 2 correct). The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks (making pair 3 correct). Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, and partially pair 2.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                     Feature
1. Curriculum framework                   :   Based on a 10+2 structure
2. Board examinations                      :   Students allowed two attempts per year.
3. Multilingualism and Indian Languages    :   Proficiency in at least one Indian language is required.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE is based on a 5+3+3+4 structure, not 10+2 (making pair 1 incorrect).  The NCF-SE does allow students to take board exams on at least two occasions during a school year (making pair 2 correct).  The framework promotes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages (making pair 3 incorrect). Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization                         Mandate/Focus
1. UNFPA                               :   Combating hunger globally.
2. UNDESA                              :   Monitoring implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.
3.  World Food Programme (WFP)        :   Ensuring sexual and reproductive health rights.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA focuses on sexual and reproductive health rights, not combating hunger (making pair 1 incorrect).  UNDESA is indeed involved in monitoring the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (making pair 2 correct). The World Food Programme (WFP) is focused on combating hunger, not ensuring sexual and reproductive health rights (making pair 3 incorrect). Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme, consider the following statements:**

   Statement                                  Status
1.  It is solely managed by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.    :   True
2.  It promotes 100% mechanization of sanitation services.                     :   True
3. It is a joint initiative of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. :   False

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NAMASTE is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (making statement 1 incorrect and 3 correct).  It does promote 100% mechanization of sanitation services (making statement 2 correct). Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

   Report                                  Releasing Organization
1. Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report :  World Economic Forum
2. Global Gender Gap Index                  :  UNHCR
3. Global Food Policy Report 2023          :  IFPRI

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" is released by UNHCR, not the World Economic Forum (making pair 1 incorrect). The Global Gender Gap Index is released by the World Economic Forum, not UNHCR (making pair 2 incorrect). The Global Food Policy Report 2023 is indeed released by IFPRI (making pair 3 correct). Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**10. With reference to the  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Governing Board Position                 Person
1. President                               :   Union Minister of Science & Technology
2. Vice-President                           :   Prime Minister
3. Member                                  :   Member from NITI Aayog dealing with Science & Technology

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The President of the Governing Board is the Prime Minister (making pair 1 incorrect).  The Vice-Presidents include the Union Minister of Science & Technology and the Union Minister of Education (making pair 2 incorrect).  A Member from NITI Aayog dealing with Science & Technology is indeed a member of the Governing Board (making pair 3 correct). Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

    State                     PVTG
1. Madhya Pradesh           :  Kadar
2. Odisha                    :  Didayi
3. Chhattisgarh             :  Bharia
4. Andaman and Nicobar Islands :  Shompen

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India, and Didayi is one of them.  The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  The Shompen are an indigenous people of the Nicobar Islands, and are recognized as a PVTG.  The Kadar tribe is found in Kerala, not Madhya Pradesh.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The question includes plausible distractors by including a related but incorrect state for the Kadar tribe (option 1) and correctly matched PVTGs with potentially confusing state associations (options 2 and 3).


**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                       State/Region
1. Hakki Pikki                :   Tamil Nadu
2. Konda Reddis              :   Andhra Pradesh
3. Pardis                     :   Rajasthan
4. Banjaras                   :   Gujarat

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group primarily from Karnataka, not Tamil Nadu. Konda Reddis are a hunter-gatherer community found in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.  Pardis are a pastoral community found in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.  Banjaras are pastoral communities found across several states including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The question uses distractors by placing Hakki Pikki in a geographically distant state and including Banjaras, which are indeed pastoral but not exclusively located in Gujarat.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

    Disability Category           Provision
1. Intellectual Disability      :   Free education only up to age 12.
2. Acid Attack Victims         :   Recognized under 21 types of disabilities
3. Benchmark Disability       :  Requires less than 40% disability for classification.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, provides free education for children with benchmark disabilities from age 6 to 18, making statement 1 incorrect. Acid attack victims are explicitly included in the 21 types of disabilities recognized under the Act.  "Person with benchmark disability" means a person with *not less than* 40% of a specified disability, making statement 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. The question cleverly uses distractors by altering the age range for free education and misrepresenting the threshold percentage for benchmark disability.


**4.  With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, consider the following pairs:**

    Offence                      Description
1. Employing manual scavengers :   Cleaning sewers with protective gear.
2. Constructing insanitary latrines:   A violation under the Act.
3.  Safal Karamcharis           :   Not considered manual scavengers.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Employing manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines is explicitly prohibited, and doing so even with protective gear is still a violation. Constructing insanitary latrines is a clear violation.  Safal Karamcharis, who are sweepers or cleaning workers, are considered manual scavengers if they handle human waste without appropriate protective gear. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question's distractors play on the nuances of the definition of manual scavenging and the exceptions to the law.


**5. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan), consider the following pairs:**

    Program Component           Implementing Agency
1.  Poshan Tracker App        :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2.  Anganwadi Services Scheme:   Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  ICDS-CAS                  :   State Governments only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Poshan Tracker app is a key component of the POSHAN Abhiyan, implemented under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The Anganwadi Services Scheme is indeed under the MoWCD. While State Governments play a significant role in implementing ICDS-CAS, it is a *centrally sponsored* scheme under MoWCD and therefore not solely implemented by State Governments.  Thus, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The distractors in the question focus on the collaborative nature of the program's implementation, potentially confusing the primary implementing agency.


**6. With reference to Global Indices related to Gender and Development, consider the following pairs:**

    Index Name                       Releasing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index        :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index    :   World Economic Forum
3. Path to Equal Report            :   UN Women and UNDP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. The Gender Social Norms Index is indeed released by the UNDP. The Path to Equal Report is jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The distractors cleverly swap the releasing organizations of the first two indices, testing the candidate's knowledge of these specific reports.


**7. With reference to  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Feature                     Specific Detail
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target :   100% by 2030 in Higher Education
2. Multiple Exit Options            :   Available for Undergraduate degrees only
3. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)     :   Stores credits earned from various institutions digitally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 targets a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, not 100% by 2030, making pair 1 incorrect. While multiple exit options are primarily associated with undergraduate degrees, the policy also encourages flexibility in other levels of education, making pair 2 partially incorrect. The ABC system is accurately described in pair 3.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The question uses distractors by altering the target GER percentage and the scope of multiple exit options.


**8. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

    Curriculum Feature                Specific Detail
1. Schooling Structure Design        :   4+3+3+4
2. Board Examinations                :   Allowed twice yearly, best score retained
3. Multilingualism                    :   Proficiency in at least four languages required

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 design for schooling, not 4+3+3+4, making pair 1 incorrect. The provision for students to take board examinations twice yearly, keeping the best score, is accurate. The NCF-SE promotes proficiency in at least three languages, not four, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question's distractors subtly alter the number of years in the schooling structure and the number of languages required for proficiency.


**9. With reference to  Organizations working on Indigenous Issues, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                           Mandate/Function
1. UNFPA                               :   Monitors implementation of UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
2. UNPFII                               :   Deals with indigenous issues related to economic and social development
3. GANHRI                               :   Accredits National Human Rights Institutions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA's mandate focuses on sexual and reproductive health, not the rights of the child, making pair 1 incorrect.  The UNPFII accurately deals with indigenous issues related to economic and social development. GANHRI's function of accrediting National Human Rights Institutions is also correct.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question uses distractors by mismatching the UNFPA's mandate and creating a potentially confusing link between indigenous issues and human rights accreditation.


**10. With reference to Government Initiatives related to Child Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Name                         Key Feature
1. National Child Labour Project (NCLP):   Managed by Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
2. PENCiL Portal                       :   Focuses on rescuing and rehabilitating child labour victims
3. Bachpan Bachao Andolan             :   A government initiative


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCLP is a Central Sector scheme under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, making pair 1 incorrect. The PENCiL portal is accurately described as a tool for rescuing and rehabilitating child labour victims. The Bachpan Bachao Andolan is a non-governmental organization (NGO), not a government initiative, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The distractors in this question play on the different ministries involved in child welfare and the distinction between government and NGO initiatives.



**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Stage of Schooling                     Characteristic
1. Foundational Stage (ages 3-8)       :   Culmination of Environmental Education as a separate area of study
2. Preparatory Stage (ages 8-11)       :   Introduction of Interdisciplinary Areas of Study
3. Middle Stage (ages 11-14)           :   Emphasis on capacities for scientific inquiry
4. Secondary Stage (ages 14-18)       :   Flexibility and choice in subject selection, no hard separations between academic and vocational subjects

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE outlines a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.  Option (c) correctly identifies that the Middle Stage (ages 11-14) emphasizes developing capacities for scientific inquiry, aligning with the framework's focus on fostering scientific thinking from an early age.  The Secondary Stage (ages 14-18) is characterized by flexibility and choice, breaking down traditional barriers between academic and vocational streams.  Options (1) and (2) are incorrect. Environmental education is integrated throughout all stages, not culminating only at the Secondary Stage.  While Interdisciplinary studies are introduced later, they are not exclusively introduced at the Preparatory Stage.  Option (d) is incorrect because of the inaccuracies in pairings 1 and 2.  The NCF-SE aims for a holistic approach to education, integrating various aspects across different stages.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                    Characteristic
1. 2017-18                               :   Highest grade attained was Prachesta-2
2. 2021-22                               :   Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram were in the lowest grade (Akanshi-3)
3. 2021-22                               :   Reduction in deviation between maximum and minimum scores was 23.8% of maximum points
4. 2017-18                               :   Disparity between maximum and minimum scores was 51%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PGI assesses the performance of school education systems at State and District levels.  Option (d) accurately reflects the data for the years mentioned.  In 2021-22, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram indeed occupied the lowest grade (Akanshi-3). The reduction in score deviation in 2021-22 compared to 2017-18 is also correctly stated (23.8% vs. 51%). Option (a) is incorrect as the highest grade attained in 2017-18 was not Prachesta-2. Options (b) and (c) are partially correct but do not include all the correctly matched pairs.  The PGI highlights disparities in educational performance across states and the progress made in reducing these disparities over time.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Institution Ranking           Ranking Category
1. Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore :   501-600 bracket
2. Anna University                             :   201-250 bracket
3. University of Oxford (UK)                  :   Top-ranked globally
4. IIT Bombay                                 :   149


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question refers to World University Rankings. Option (c) correctly matches the University of Oxford as the top-ranked university globally, and IIT Bombay's ranking at 149. Options 1 and 2 are incorrect. IISc Bangalore was in the 201-250 bracket, and Anna University was in the 501-600 bracket according to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024. Option (d) is incorrect due to the mismatches in options 1 and 2. These rankings provide insights into the global standing of higher education institutions.



**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs), consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation/Provision                           Characteristic
1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 :   Institutions less than 20 years old are eligible to apply
2. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2019 :   Clusters of institutions under multiple sponsoring bodies can apply
3. UGC Act 1956                               :   Provides for the Central Government to declare institutions as DTBUs
4. NCERT's DTBU status                         : Allows offering graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question pertains to the regulations and legal framework governing Deemed-to-be Universities in India. Option (d) accurately reflects the features of the regulations and act. The 2023 regulations allow institutions younger than 20 years to apply, unlike the 2019 regulations.  The UGC Act 1956 provides the legal basis for granting DTBU status, and NCERT's DTBU status grants it the authority to offer various degrees.  Option (a) is incorrect as it omits important correct pairings. Options (b) and (c) are partially correct but incomplete.  The evolution of DTBU regulations highlights the changing landscape of higher education in India.



**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   Framework/Level                                 Characteristic
1. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) :   Levels 4.5-8
2. National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)     :   Levels 1-4
3. National Curriculum Framework (NCF)/National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF) :   Integrated with vocational education and training from levels 1 to 8
4. NCrF                                          :   Includes notional learning hours of 1200 hours/year


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF aims to integrate credits earned through various educational pathways. Option (b) correctly identifies that the NHEQF covers levels 4.5-8, and the NCrF incorporates a notional learning hour system of 1200 hours/year. Options 2 and 3 are incorrect. The NSQF and NCF/NSEQF are not limited to the levels mentioned. The NCrF integrates these frameworks to allow for credit transfer and flexibility. Option (d) is incorrect because of the inaccuracies in pairings 2 and 3.  The NCrF's comprehensive approach promotes lifelong learning and skill development.


**6. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   State                                          Number of PVTGs
1. Odisha                                        :   13
2. Madhya Pradesh                              :   75
3. Chhattisgarh                                 :   18
4. Andaman and Nicobar Islands                  :   2


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The question focuses on the distribution of PVTGs across Indian states.  Option (a) is correct as Odisha indeed houses 13 PVTGs.  Options 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect.  The total number of PVTGs is 75, spread across 18 states and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands;  Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are not the only states with PVTGs. The number of PVTGs in Chhattisgarh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands are not accurately reflected in options (b), (c) and (d).  The identification of PVTGs highlights the need for targeted interventions to address their unique vulnerabilities.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                                   State(s) where recognized as PVTG
1. Bharia                                        :   Chhattisgarh only
2. Kamar                                         :   Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
3. Baiga                                         :   Madhya Pradesh only
4. Konda Reddis                                 :   Andhra Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question deals with the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups recognized as PVTGs. Option (a) correctly identifies that the Kamar tribe is recognized as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and the Konda Reddis are a PVTG in Andhra Pradesh. Options 1 and 3 are incorrect; the Bharia and Baiga tribes are recognized as PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatches. The information highlights the complexities of tribal demographics in India.


**8. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                      Characteristic
1. Reservation in Government jobs              :   Not less than 4%
2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions:   Not less than 5%
3. Definition of "Person with benchmark disability":   Less than 40% of specified disability
4. Applicability of reservation                : Includes Police forces


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge of the provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016. Option (a) accurately states the reservation percentages for government jobs (4%) and higher educational institutions (5%). Option 3 is incorrect; a "Person with benchmark disability" is defined as having at least 40%, not less than 40%, of a specified disability. Option 4 is also incorrect; the reservation is not applicable to police forces. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of false pairings. The Act aims to promote the inclusion and empowerment of persons with disabilities.


**9. With reference to Manual Scavenging, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                     Characteristic
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:   Bans manual scavenging
2. National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem:    Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning
3. Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS):   Provides concessional loans for sanitation equipment
4. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                     :   Rehabilitates manual scavengers in alternative professions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses understanding of legislation and schemes related to manual scavenging. Option (a) correctly matches the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, with its objective of banning the practice, and the National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem with its aim to eliminate hazardous cleaning. Options 3 and 4 are incorrect; the SRMS scheme rehabilitates manual scavengers through alternate employment, and the Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the mismatches. The efforts to eradicate manual scavenging highlight the ongoing struggle for social justice and dignity.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Key Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                         :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
2. UNDESA                                        :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3. UNHCR                                        :   India Ageing Report 2023
4. IFPRI                                         :   Global Food Policy Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge of international organizations and their key publications. Option (a) correctly matches UNDESA with the Sustainable Development Goals Progress Report and IFPRI with the Global Food Policy Report. Options 1 and 3 are incorrect; UNFPA releases the State of World Population report, and UNHCR publishes reports on refugee trends. Option (d) is incorrect due to the mismatches in options 1 and 3. These reports provide valuable data and analysis on global development challenges.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                 Key Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021        :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy
2. Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 :  Regulates ART clinics and banks
3. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971  :  Allows abortion up to 20 weeks for all on advice of one doctor
4.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Bans manual scavenging

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly legalizes only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, comprehensively regulates ART clinics and banks to ensure ethical practices and prevent misuse. The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, permits abortion up to 20 weeks for all women based on the advice of one registered medical practitioner.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to completely eradicate the practice of manual scavenging and rehabilitate those previously engaged in it.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to Child Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                     Provision/Focus
1. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a child as a person below 18 years of age.
2. National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme  :   Provides rehabilitation centers for child laborers
3.  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956 : Governs inter-country adoption of children
4.  CARINGS portal                        :  Facilitates registration of Orphaned-Abandoned-Surrendered children

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, indeed defines a child as someone under 18. The NCLP scheme focuses on the rehabilitation of child laborers through special schools and centers.  The CARINGS portal is used for registering orphaned, abandoned, and surrendered children. However, HAMA, 1956, primarily deals with adoption within the Hindu community and doesn't govern inter-country adoptions; that aspect falls under the Juvenile Justice Act and associated regulations. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair (3) or omit correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to organizations working on social issues, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Mandate/Focus
1. UNFPA                                      :  Focuses on sexual and reproductive rights
2. UNDESA                                     : Releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report
3. UNCRC                                      : Monitors implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child
4. World Food Programme (WFP)               : Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 for its work

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is indeed focused on promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights.

The 2023 report also noted a slight improvement in India's GHI score compared to 2015.  All four pairs accurately reflect findings from the GHI reports. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                        State/UT with PVTG Status
1. Bharia                                      :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Kamar                                       :   Chhattisgarh
3. Baiga                                       :   Odisha
4. Hakki Pikki                               :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia and Kamar tribes are correctly paired with Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh respectively, as both states have these tribes listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  The Baiga tribe is also a PVTG, but it is found in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, not Odisha. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic tribal group from Karnataka, not from Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Konda Reddi tribe is indeed a hunter-gatherer community, a characteristic often associated with PVTGs,  but they primarily reside in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, not Karnataka. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 have accurate pairings, although the reason for the inclusion of Konda Reddi might be their hunter-gatherer status, often a characteristic of PVTGs.  The question tests the knowledge of specific tribal groups and their geographical distribution, highlighting the nuances within the categorization of PVTGs.  Understanding the distribution of these groups is crucial for effective policy implementation and tribal welfare programs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Key Provision/Focus

2. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Mandates the construction of insanitary latrines
3. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Excludes police forces from reservation provisions
4.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971:  Allows termination up to 24 weeks for all women


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to eliminate manual scavenging and mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines, not their construction. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, does indeed exclude police forces from reservation provisions.  The MTP Act, 1971, as amended in 2021, allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women and beyond 20 weeks under specific circumstances, not up to 24 weeks for all women. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests the understanding of key legislation related to social justice and welfare, highlighting the potential for misinterpretations of legal provisions.  A thorough understanding of these acts is crucial for analyzing government policies and their impact on vulnerable populations.


**3.  With reference to Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry/Organization                      Specific Initiative/Program

2. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) :   Implementation of the Idate Commission report
3. Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment :   National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare, but the SEED (Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities) scheme falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The NHRC has indeed stressed the need for implementing the Idate Commission report, which recommended a permanent commission for De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is also under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. Thus, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question assesses the understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different government ministries and organizations involved in tribal welfare and the implementation of specific programs.  Knowing which ministry is responsible for which initiative is vital for analyzing the effectiveness of government policies.


**4. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

**Explanation:**

The Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) is a digital platform for storing academic credits, and its implementation is overseen by the Ministry of Education, not NCERT.  The National Research Foundation (NRF) is established under the Ministry of Education, not by the UGC. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) is indeed developed by the Ministry of Education. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The question tests the understanding of the organizational structure and responsibilities related to the implementation of the NEP 2020.  This requires knowledge of various governmental and educational bodies and their roles in educational reforms.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                 Releasing Organization/Body

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition is correctly paired with the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA). Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  This question assesses knowledge of various international organizations and their publications, requiring awareness of different reports and indices related to global development goals.  The ability to correctly identify the releasing body is crucial for understanding the credibility and context of these reports.

4. Bachpan Bachao Andolan                           : Primarily focuses on rescuing children from bonded labour

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and also prohibits the employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  Option 1 is incorrect because it states an age of 18, whereas the act specifies 14 as the age below which employment is prohibited in all occupations. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme aims at rehabilitating child labourers through education and skill development. Option 2 is partially correct as it focuses on rehabilitation, but not exclusively on skill development. It includes providing education and vocational training. PENCiL portal is managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development, making option 3 incorrect.  Bachpan Bachao Andolan is an NGO that primarily focuses on rescuing children from exploitation, including bonded labour, hence making option 4 correct but only partially as it does not cover all forms of child exploitation. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are partially correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                               Description
1. Definition of "Child"                                  :  A person who has not completed 16 years of age
2. Adoption process                                      : Finalized only after an order from a Juvenile Justice Board
3. Categories of Offenses                               : Divided into Heinous, Serious, and Petty offences based on maximum punishment
4. Appeals against Child Welfare Committee orders     :  Always allowed directly to High Courts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The JJ Act defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age, not 16, making option 1 incorrect.  The adoption process under the JJ Act, 2015, as amended, involves orders from District Magistrates, not solely Juvenile Justice Boards, thereby making option 2 incorrect. The JJ Act categorizes offenses into heinous, serious, and petty offenses based on the maximum punishment prescribed, making option 3 correct. Appeals against Child Welfare Committee orders are subject to specific provisions and timelines and may not always go directly to High Courts, rendering option 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.



**3.  With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA), consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                      Definition/Feature
1. Domestic Violence                          :  Exclusively encompasses physical and sexual abuse
2. Aggrieved Woman                           :  Includes only legally married women
3.  Complaint can be filed against             : Only the husband of the aggrieved woman
4. Reliefs provided under the Act              : Are not available alongside other legal proceedings


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PWDVA defines domestic violence broadly, encompassing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse, making option 1 incorrect. The Act covers all women in domestic relationships, regardless of marital status, thus making option 2 incorrect.  Complaints can be filed against the husband, relatives of the husband, or male partner, making option 3 incorrect.  The Act allows for reliefs to be sought concurrently with other legal proceedings, making option 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                     Specific Detail
1. Reservation in Government jobs                :  Minimum 4% reservation across all government departments
2. Definition of "Person with benchmark disability" :  A person with at least 50% of a specified disability
3. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities:  Applies to children aged 6-18 years, only in special schools
4. Office of Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities :  Functions under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs, but with exceptions for certain forces, making option 1 partially incorrect.  The act defines a "person with benchmark disability" as someone with at least 40%, not 50%, of a specified disability, making option 2 incorrect.  Free education is provided to children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18, in either neighbourhood or special schools, at their choice, making option 3 incorrect. The Office of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities functions under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, making option 4 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of NCF-SE                                 Characteristic
1.  Science Education                                :  Focuses solely on theoretical knowledge
2. Interdisciplinary Areas of Study                   :  Introduced only at the higher secondary level
3. Environmental Education                          :  Integrated at all levels, but not a separate subject at the secondary level
4. Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:  A tool to assess performance at the state level only.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE emphasizes both theoretical and practical aspects of science education, including inquiry-based learning, making option 1 incorrect.  Interdisciplinary areas of study are introduced at various levels, including secondary, making option 2 incorrect. Environmental education is integrated at all levels and may culminate in a separate area of study at the secondary stage, making option 3 incorrect. The PGI assesses performance at both state and district levels, making option 4 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Concept                                  Detail
1.  Scheduled Tribes (STs)                        : Defined exclusively by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :  Criteria for identification includes pre-industrial level of technology
3. PM JANMAN                                      :  Focuses solely on providing housing to PVTG households
4.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                       :  All nomadic tribes are DNTs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Scheduled Tribes are defined by the President of India through public notification, not solely by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, making option 1 incorrect. PVTGs are identified based on criteria that include a pre-agricultural level of technology, not pre-industrial, making option 2 incorrect. PM JANMAN has a broader focus than just housing, encompassing various basic facilities and health initiatives for PVTGs, making option 3 incorrect.  Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; DNTs are a subset of nomadic tribes, making option 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the  National Family Health Survey (NFHS), consider the following pairs:**

   Survey finding                                     Specific Detail
1. Spousal abuse in India                            : Highest percentage reported in Karnataka
2. Prevalence of spousal violence among ever-married women:  NFHS-5 data shows a rate below 25%
3.  Data collection methodology                     : Primarily relies on self-reported data from respondents
4.  NFHS data on child marriage rates                : Data has shown a steady increase in child marriages in recent years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NFHS-5 data indicates a higher percentage of spousal abuse in Karnataka compared to other states, making option 1 correct. The NFHS-5 report indicates that 29.3% of ever-married women aged 18-49 have experienced spousal violence, making option 2 incorrect. NFHS relies heavily on self-reported data, making option 3 correct. NFHS data generally shows a decline in child marriage rates, not an increase, making option 4 incorrect. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to  International Organizations working on Social Issues, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                       Key Focus Area
1. UNFPA                                              : Primarily focuses on issues related to climate change
2. UNDESA                                             :  Produces reports on the progress of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
3. UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD): Monitors the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action
4. World Food Programme (WFP)                      :  Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 for its work in combating hunger


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d)  1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

UNFPA's primary focus is on sexual and reproductive health, not climate change, making option 1 incorrect. UNDESA plays a key role in monitoring and reporting on SDG progress, making option 2 correct.  The UN Commission on Population and Development monitors the implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), not the Beijing Platform for Action, making option 3 incorrect.  The WFP was indeed awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 for its work on hunger, making option 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                  Key Provision
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021       :   Allows only altruistic surrogacy
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (amended 2021) :  Allows termination up to 24 weeks for all women
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Penalizes employing individuals for manual scavenging without protective gear
4.  The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 :  Provides for a certificate of identity based on self-perceived gender identity
5.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a child as a person below 18 years of age


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly permits only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy.  The MTP Act, as amended in 2021, allows for pregnancy termination up to 20 weeks for all women, with provisions for extension under specific circumstances. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, criminalizes the employment of individuals for manual scavenging without adequate safety measures. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, grants transgender individuals the right to self-identify their gender and obtain a certificate reflecting this identity. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, defines a "child" as anyone under 18 years of age.  Option (a) is incorrect because the MTP Act's allowance for termination is up to 20 weeks, not 24. Option (b) is incorrect because it excludes the correct matching of the Juvenile Justice Act. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly excludes the correct matching of the Manual Scavenging Act.


**2. With reference to Child Welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                       Key Feature
1.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme  :   Managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal :  A tool for rescuing and rehabilitating child labour victims
3.  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956 :  Governs inter-country adoption of orphaned children
4.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines 'heinous offences' for juveniles aged 16-18
5.  Bachpan Bachao Andolan                       :  A government initiative to combat child trafficking


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The PENCiL portal is indeed a crucial tool for rescuing and rehabilitating child labour victims, managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, does categorize offences for juveniles aged 16-18, including the definition of "heinous offences."  The NCLP scheme falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. HAMA, 1956, deals with Hindu adoptions, not inter-country adoptions; that falls under the JJ Act, 2015, and related regulations.  Bachpan Bachao Andolan is a prominent NGO, not a government initiative.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Report                                    Key Focus/Publication
1.  UNFPA                                              :  Global Report on Food Crisis
2.  World Food Programme (WFP)                       :  State of World Population Report
3.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :  Global Food Policy Report
4.  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) : Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report
5.  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)   :  Guidance on children’s right to a clean environment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The IFPRI is known for its Global Food Policy Report. UNDESA publishes the SDG Progress Report.  The UNCRC recently issued guidance on children's right to a healthy environment. The UNFPA's key publication is the State of World Population Report, not the Global Report on Food Crisis (that's the WFP). The WFP doesn't produce a State of World Population Report; that's the UNFPA. Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to  Government Initiatives related to Social Justice, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act                                      Target Group/Objective
1.  PM JANMAN                                        :  Focuses solely on Scheduled Castes
2.  SMILE (Support for Marginalised Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise) :  Targets transgender individuals for socio-economic development
3.  National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) :  Aims to eliminate manual scavenging
4.  Prayatna Project                                   :  A skill development program for Denotified Tribes
5.  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) :  Provides financial assistance to differently-abled individuals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

SMILE directly targets transgender individuals for socio-economic empowerment. NAMASTE aims to eliminate manual scavenging through mechanization. PM JANMAN is a broader initiative for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), not limited to Scheduled Castes. The Prayatna project focuses on livelihood and enterprise training for transgender people, not DNTs. SRMS is for rehabilitating manual scavengers, not the differently-abled.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Body                                   Mandate/Function
1.  National Medical Commission (NMC)              :  Oversees medical education and practice in India
2.  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) :  Issues guidelines for assessment of child suspects in heinous offences
3.  Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA)      :  Regulates all aspects of inter-country adoptions
4.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)        :  Accredited by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
5.  National Council for Transgender Persons        :  Advises the Central Government on transgender-related policies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The NMC oversees medical education and practice.  The NCPCR issues guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offences. The National Council for Transgender Persons advises the Central Government. CARA's mandate includes both inter-country and intra-country adoptions.  The NHRC's GANHRI accreditation status is subject to review and has been deferred. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched.



**1. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following pairs:**

   **Provision**                                      **Amendment in 2021**
1. Adoption of a child                               :   Adoption orders issued by District Magistrates
2. Appeals against Child Welfare Committee orders :   Appeals allowed to the Divisional Commissioner
3. Categories of Offences                           :   Redefinition of 'serious offences' based on Supreme Court recommendations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 2021 amendment to the Juvenile Justice Act significantly altered the adoption process by empowering District Magistrates to issue adoption orders, eliminating the previous reliance solely on civil courts. This is accurately reflected in pair 1.  Pair 2 is also correctly matched as the amendment introduced an appeal process to the Divisional Commissioner against Child Welfare Committee orders, a change not present in the original 2015 Act. Finally, pair 3 is correct because the 2021 amendment redefined 'serious offences' to align with Supreme Court recommendations in the *Shilpa Mittal v. State of NCT of Delhi* case, impacting the categorization of offenses committed by juveniles.  Therefore, all three pairs (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   **Policy Aspect**                                 **Target/Feature**
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education :   100% by 2030
2. Undergraduate Degree Duration                 :   Multiple exit options after each year
3. National Research Foundation (NRF)             :   Expansion of research and innovation across disciplines

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. NEP 2020 aims to increase the GER in higher education to 50% by 2035, not 100% by 2030.  The target of 100% GER applies to preschool to secondary level by 2030, a different educational segment. Pair 2 is correctly matched; NEP 2020 introduces multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees, allowing students to leave after one, two, three, or four years with different qualifications (certificate, diploma, Bachelor's, Honours). Pair 3 is also correctly matched; the establishment of the NRF is intended to significantly boost research and innovation across various scientific and technological domains.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or omit correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs related to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

   **Provision**                                  **Specific Detail**
1. Reservation in Government jobs              :   At least 4% reservation
2. Reservation in Higher Educational Institutions:   At least 5% reservation
3. Definition of "Person with benchmark disability":   Less than 40% of specified disability

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched; the RPwD Act mandates at least 4% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs. Pair 2 is also correctly matched; the Act specifies at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government-aided higher educational institutions. However, pair 3 is incorrect.  The act defines a "person with benchmark disability" as someone with at least 40%, not less than 40%, of a specified disability. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair 3.


**4. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, consider the following pairs:**

   **Aspect of Surrogacy**                          **Regulation**
1. Type of Surrogacy permitted                   :   Commercial surrogacy
2. Gamete donation                               :   Permitted only with at least one gamete from the intending couple
3. National level board                           :    National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. Pair 2 is correctly matched; the amended rules allow surrogacy with donor gametes only if at least one gamete originates from the intending couple. Pair 3 is correctly matched; the Act establishes the NARTSB to oversee and regulate surrogacy practices in India. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or omit correctly matched pairs.


**5.  Consider the following pairs related to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

   **NCF-SE Aspect**                               **Characteristic**
1.  Schooling Structure                             :   4+3+3+4 design
2.  Board Examinations                             :   Students allowed to take exams twice a year, best score retained
3.  Language Proficiency                          :   Proficiency in at least two Indian languages mandatory

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The NCF-SE adopts a 5+3+3+4 design for schooling, not 4+3+3+4. This represents a shift from the traditional four-stage structure. Pair 2 is correctly matched; the NCF-SE allows students to attempt board exams twice yearly, retaining only the better score. Pair 3 is incorrect; while the NCF-SE promotes multilingualism, it emphasizes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages, not just two. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**6. With reference to the  Global Food Policy Report 2023 (IFPRI), consider the following pairs:**

   **Issue**                                         **Finding**
1.  Rise in Food Insecurity                          :   Primarily due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict
2.  Surge in Food Prices in 2021-22                :   Supply chain disruptions from COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war
3.  Projected Increase in Undernourishment by 2050:   72 million more people due to climate change

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is partially correct but oversimplified. While the Russia-Ukraine war contributed to rising food insecurity, the report highlights multiple factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and political instability.  Pair 2 is correctly matched; the report directly attributes the surge in food prices in 2021-22 to supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and the war. Pair 3 is also correctly matched; the report projects a substantial increase in undernourishment by 2050, specifically citing climate change as a significant driver. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are accurately reflected. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include the partially correct and oversimplified pair 1 or omit correctly matched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs related to the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) Report:**

   **Indicator**                                      **Finding (Illustrative)**
1.  Total Fertility Rate                            :   Specific numerical value (requires access to the actual report)
2.  Maternal Mortality Rate                        :   Specific numerical value (requires access to the actual report)
3.  Prevalence of Anemia among Women              :   Specific numerical value (requires access to the actual report)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question requires access to the NFHS-5 report to provide specific numerical values for each indicator.  However, it is certain that the NFHS-5 report *does* contain data on Total Fertility Rate, Maternal Mortality Rate, and Prevalence of Anemia among Women.  Therefore, all three pairs would be correctly matched *if* the numerical values provided were accurate, making (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) assume an absence of data or an incorrect match, which cannot be definitively determined without the specific numerical values from the report.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the NFHS-5's scope and data collection.


**8. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, consider the following pairs:**

   **Offence**                                          **Description**
1.  Employing manual scavengers                     :   Using individuals to handle untreated human waste
2.  Constructing insanitary latrines                   :   Building toilets without proper sanitation facilities
3.  Cleaning sewers without protective gear           :   Cleaning sewers and septic tanks without appropriate safety equipment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, specifically criminalizes the practices described in all three pairs.  Pair 1 correctly identifies the act of employing individuals to handle untreated human waste as an offense. Pair 2 accurately defines the construction of insanitary latrines (toilets lacking proper sanitation) as a violation. Pair 3 correctly states that cleaning sewers or septic tanks without the necessary protective gear is an offense under the Act.  Thus, all three pairs are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**9.  Consider the following pairs related to the  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) reports:**

   **Report**                                         **Key Focus/Data**
1.  State of World Population Report 2023           :  India's population surpassing China's
2.  India Ageing Report 2023                       :   Trends in India's aging population
3.  Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report:  Data on global refugee numbers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched; the 2023 State of World Population Report by UNFPA did indeed highlight India's population surpassing China's. Pair 2 is also correctly matched; the UNFPA, in collaboration with IIPS, released the India Ageing Report 2023, focusing on the demographic shifts related to India's aging population. However, Pair 3 is incorrect; the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" is not a UNFPA report.  It's published by the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 3 or omit correctly matched pairs.


**10. With reference to the  Global Gender Gap Index, consider the following pairs:**

   **Index Parameter**                               **Description**
1. Economic Participation and Opportunity        :   Measures women's representation in the workforce and leadership roles
2. Educational Attainment                         :   Assesses gender parity in educational access and completion rates
3. Political Empowerment                          :   Evaluates women's representation in political positions and decision-making

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) published by the World Economic Forum measures gender equality across four key parameters.  All three pairs accurately reflect these parameters. Pair 1 correctly describes the "Economic Participation and Opportunity" parameter, focusing on gender disparities in employment and leadership. Pair 2 accurately describes the "Educational Attainment" parameter, which assesses gender equality in education. Pair 3 correctly describes the "Political Empowerment" parameter, examining women's participation in politics. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

   Emphasis Area                                     Stage of Implementation
1. Capacities for Scientific Inquiry                 :   Primary Stage Only
2. Interdisciplinary Areas of Study                  :   Secondary Stage Only
3. Environmental Education                         :   All Stages of Schooling


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry at all stages of schooling, not just the primary stage.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  Interdisciplinary areas of study are explicitly mentioned as a separate subject at the secondary stage, making pair 2 correct. Environmental education is highlighted for inclusion at all stages, culminating in a separate area of study at the secondary stage, thus pair 3 is also correct.  The correct option is (d) because pairs 2 and 3 accurately reflect the NCF-SE's implementation plan.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for School Education System, consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                          Key Finding
1. 2017-18                                      :   All States/UTs achieved the highest grade (Daksh)
2. 2021-22                                      :   Punjab and Chandigarh attained the highest grade (Daksh)
3. 2021-22                                      :   Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram were in the lowest grade (Akanshi-3)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

In 2017-18, no States/UTs attained the highest grade (Daksh) in the PGI.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. In 2021-22, Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade attained, which was Prachesta-2, not Daksh. Thus, pair 2 is incorrect.  Pair 3 correctly states that Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram were indeed in the lowest grade (Akanshi-3) in 2021-22. Hence, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for Higher Education, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Element                                 Target/Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)                  :   At least 25% by 2035
2. Undergraduate Degrees                         :   3-year duration only
3. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                 :   Digital storage of academic credits from various institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50% by 2035, not 25%, making pair 1 incorrect. Undergraduate degrees are designed to be of either 3 or 4-year duration, with multiple exit options, thus pair 2 is incorrect.  Pair 3 accurately describes the function of the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC). Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation/Feature                                   Description
1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023  :   Supersedes the 2019 regulations
2. Institutions less than 20 years old                     :   Ineligible to apply for DTBU status under 2019 regulations
3. NCERT after being granted DTBU status                   :   Cannot offer its own graduate, post-graduate, and doctoral degrees

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 regulations indeed supersede the 2019 regulations, making pair 1 correct.  Under the 2019 regulations, institutions had to be in existence for at least 20 years to apply for DTBU status, making pair 2 correct.  However, NCERT, after being granted DTBU status, *can* offer its own graduate, post-graduate, and doctoral degrees, rendering pair 3 incorrect. Thus, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation/Requirement                            Description
1. UGC approval                                    :   Required before establishing Indian campuses
2. Eligibility for FHEIs                             :   Ranked within top 1000 globally
3. Online or distance learning programmes         :   Permitted by FHEIs in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

UGC approval is mandatory before FHEIs establish Indian campuses, offer programs, or discontinue courses, making pair 1 correct.  FHEIs must be ranked within the top 500 globally (overall or subject-wise), making pair 2 incorrect.  FHEIs are *not* allowed to offer online or distance learning programs in India, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**6. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   Framework Element                                   Description
1. Levels 1-4                                        :   Refer to Higher Education
2. Levels 4.5-8                                        :   Refer to Vocational Education and Training
3. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF):   Not encompassed by NCrF

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Levels 1-4 in the NCrF refer to school education, not higher education, making pair 1 incorrect. Levels 4.5-8 encompass higher education, not solely vocational education and training, making pair 2 incorrect. The NHEQF is explicitly mentioned as being encompassed by the NCrF, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for School Education System, consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                           Key Performance Indicator
1. 2017-18                                      :   Deviation between maximum and minimum scores was 23.8%
2. 2021-22                                      :   Deviation between maximum and minimum scores was 51%
3. 2021-22                                      :  No State/UT achieved the highest grade (Daksh)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The deviation between maximum and minimum scores in 2017-18 was 51%, not 23.8%, making pair 1 incorrect. The deviation in 2021-22 was 23.8%, not 51%, making pair 2 incorrect.  Pair 3 is correct; no State/UT achieved the highest grade (Daksh) in 2021-22.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Initiative                                  Objective
1. Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs):   To lower standards for multidisciplinary education
2. National Research Foundation (NRF)                :   To hinder research and innovation

   Year                                          Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)
1. 2020-21                                      :   28.4%
2. 2021-22                                      :   27.3%
3. 2021-22 (Female GER)                           :   28.5%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GER in 2020-21 was 27.3%, not 28.4%, making pair 1 incorrect. The GER in 2021-22 was 28.4%, not 27.3%, making pair 2 incorrect. The female GER in 2021-22 was 28.5%, making pair 3 correct. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**10. With reference to World University Rankings 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   University                                        Ranking Bracket
1. University of Oxford                             :   201-250
2. Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore     :   201-250

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The University of Oxford was ranked as the best university in the world, not in the 201-250 bracket, making pair 1 incorrect. IISc Bangalore was placed in the 201-250 bracket, making pair 2 correct. IIT Bombay was ranked in the 149th position, not in the 501-600 bracket, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Tribal Group                     State/UT
1. Bharia PVTG                     :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                      :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                       :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all recognized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  However, the provided options contain some inaccuracies regarding their distribution across states.  Bharia and Baiga are indeed found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making statement 1 and 3 partially correct, but not fully as presented. The Kamar tribe is also found in Chhattisgarh alongside Madhya Pradesh. Option (b) is correct because it correctly identifies that both the Kamar and Bharia PVTGs are found in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh respectively. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes Bharia, omitting Kamar. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes Baiga, which is found in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, alongside the incorrect Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Option (d) is incorrect because it assumes all three pairs are correctly matched, which is false.  Understanding the geographical distribution of PVTGs is crucial for effective tribal welfare policies.

**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Tribe                                     Characteristic
1. Hakki Pikki Tribe                 :   Hunter/Trapper
2. Konda Reddis                       :   Semi-nomadic
3. Pardis                               :   Pastoral community

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the understanding of different nomadic and semi-nomadic tribal groups in India and their primary livelihoods. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group primarily from Karnataka, not hunters or trappers.  The Konda Reddis are indeed a hunter-gatherer tribe.  The Pardis are a pastoral community known for their nomadic lifestyle and animal husbandry. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because the Hakki Pikki are semi-nomadic, not hunter-gatherers. Option (c) is incorrect as it only includes the Pardis, ignoring the correctly matched Konda Reddis. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly matches the Hakki Pikki tribe to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Understanding the diverse livelihoods of these groups is important for designing effective welfare schemes.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

Type of Disability                      Provision
1. Intellectual Disability             :   Free education for children aged 6-18
2. Acid Attack Victims                :   4% reservation in government jobs
3. Benchmark Disability (40% or more):  Not applicable to police forces

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, covers a wide range of provisions for different types of disabilities. The act includes intellectual disability as a recognized disability, and children with benchmark disabilities (those with at least 40% disability) have the right to free education between the ages of 6 and 18.  Acid attack victims are included under the umbrella of disabilities covered by the act and are entitled to the 4% reservation in government jobs. The 4% reservation in government jobs is applicable across various recognized disabilities but is specifically excluded for police forces.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  Understanding the comprehensive nature of this act and its provisions is essential for ensuring the rights of persons with disabilities are upheld.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Scheme                                      Objective
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   100% mechanization of sanitation
2. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                          :   Rehabilitation of manual scavengers
3. NAMASTE scheme                                   :   Concessional loans for sanitation equipment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge of government initiatives aimed at eradicating manual scavenging and improving sanitation. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, primarily focuses on prohibiting the practice and rehabilitating those engaged in it, not on complete mechanization of sanitation.  The Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment, not the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.  The NAMASTE (National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem) scheme aims for 100% mechanization of sanitation-related tasks. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the objectives of at least one of the schemes.  Knowledge of these schemes is crucial for understanding India's progress towards improved sanitation.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

NEP 2020 Feature                            Specific Aspect
1. Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs):  Aim to increase GER to 50% by 2035
2. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                   :   Digital storage of academic credits
3. National Research Foundation (NRF)              :   To catalyse research and innovation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the understanding of key features of the NEP 2020 and their specific objectives.  While NEP 2020 aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) to 50% by 2035, this is a broad goal of the policy, not specifically tied to MERUs. MERUs aim to provide high standards of multidisciplinary education, but not directly connected to the GER target.  The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a digital platform designed to store academic credits earned from various institutions, making statement 2 correct.  The National Research Foundation (NRF) is established to promote and support research and innovation across various fields, accurately describing statement 3.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to misinterpretations of the relationship between NEP features and their specific aspects.  Knowledge of the NEP 2020 is essential for understanding reforms in India's education system.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                  Report/Initiative
1. UNFPA                                      :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2. UNHCR                                      :   India Ageing Report 2023
3. IFPRI                                       :   Global Food Policy Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge of various international organizations and their key publications and initiatives. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) publishes reports related to population trends, including those on aging, but the India Ageing Report 2023 was released in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), not solely by UNFPA. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) releases the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement" report annually. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) published the Global Food Policy Report 2023.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccurate pairings of organizations with their reports.  Familiarity with these organizations and their work is important for understanding global issues.


**7. With reference to the initiatives for women's welfare, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                     Focus Area
1. Boeing Sukanya Program                  : Prevention of Domestic Violence
2. RESPECT Women Framework                : Promoting Women in STEM fields
3. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005: Providing Civil Remedies for Marital Rape

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the knowledge of various initiatives aimed at women's welfare and their specific focus areas. The Boeing Sukanya Program focuses on promoting girls' entry into the aviation sector and STEM fields. The RESPECT Women Framework is a collaborative effort to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provides civil remedies for domestic violence, including marital rape.  Only pair 3 correctly matches the initiative with its focus area.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to mismatching of initiatives and their focus areas.  Understanding these different initiatives is important for assessing the government's efforts towards women's empowerment.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Scheme/Program                   Primary Goal
1. Saksham Anganwadis                        :  Digital strengthening of AWCs
2. Intensified Mission Indradhanush          :  Improve nutritional status of children (0-6 years)
3. Poshan Abhiyaan                             :  Reaching zero-dose children

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge of government schemes related to child health and nutrition. Saksham Anganwadis focuses on strengthening and upgrading Anganwadi Centers (AWCs), including digital initiatives for better monitoring and service delivery.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush aims to improve immunization coverage, specifically targeting children who missed vaccine doses, not directly improving nutritional status. Poshan Abhiyaan aims to improve the nutritional status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, but it is not solely focused on reaching zero-dose children. Only pair 1 accurately reflects the primary goal of the scheme. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the primary goals of at least one of the schemes.  Understanding these schemes is essential for evaluating India's progress towards improving child health and nutrition.



**1. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                                       Key Feature
    1. Saksham Anganwadis                               : Aims to improve AWCs by focusing on adolescent girls (14-18 years) in Aspirational Districts and NER.
    2. Poshan Tracker mobile application                 :  A job-aid for AWWs to efficiently deliver services and track nutrition service delivery.
    3. Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) : Insurance coverage specifically for Anganwadi Workers (AWWs).
    4.  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)     :  A centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Saksham Anganwadis is a targeted intervention to strengthen and upgrade Anganwadi Centers (AWCs), focusing on adolescent girls in specific regions. The Poshan Tracker app is a mobile-based application designed to aid Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) in efficient service delivery and monitoring of nutrition programs.  Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) provides insurance coverage to AWWs, along with other schemes like PMSBY and AKBY. Finally, the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme, under the MoWCD, is the overarching program within which the Anganwadi system operates.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all four correctly matched pairs is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to the  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan, consider the following pairs:**

    Ministry/Organization                         Role/Activity
    1. Ministry of Tribal Affairs                   :  Nodal ministry for the implementation of POSHAN Abhiyan.
    2. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)                  :  Frontline workers responsible for providing early childhood care and development services.
    3. Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs)             : Primarily focuses on promotion of Maternal and Child Health, including immunizations.
    4. Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) : Create awareness on factors determining health status and counsel women on birth deliveries.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While POSHAN Abhiyan aims to improve nutrition, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is not the nodal ministry.  The nodal ministry for the POSHAN Abhiyan is the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  However, AWWs, ANMs, and ASHAs play crucial roles in implementing the program at the grassroots level. AWWs provide early childhood care and development services, ANMs focus on maternal and child health, and ASHAs raise awareness and provide counseling. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they either incorrectly identify the nodal ministry or omit the crucial roles of AWWs, ANMs, and ASHAs. Option (d) correctly identifies the roles of the community health workers.


**3. With reference to  Organizations in News, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                      Key Report/Activity
    1. UNFPA                                          :  Released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with IIPS.
    2. UNDESA                                         :  Released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023.
    3. UNCRC                                          :  Issued guidance on children's right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.
    4. World Food Programme (WFP)                    : Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 for efforts to combat hunger.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are accurately matched.  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) collaborated with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) to release the India Ageing Report 2023. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) published the SDG Progress Report 2023.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) issued significant guidance on children's environmental rights.  Finally, the World Food Programme (WFP) was indeed awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 for its work in combating hunger. Option (d) is correct as it includes all four correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.



**4. With reference to  Open Defecation Free (ODF) Status, consider the following pairs:**

    Term/Concept                                    Definition/Characteristic
    1. ODF Status                                     :  Every household and public/community institution uses safe technology for faecal disposal.
    2. ODF Plus village                               :  Sustained ODF status with implementation of either solid or liquid waste management systems.
    3. ODF Plus Model village                         :  Sustains ODF status, has arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, observes visual cleanliness, and displays IEC messages.
    4. Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II     : Achieved 75% ODF Plus status in Indian villages by September 2023.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the definitions and characteristics related to ODF status and the Swachh Bharat Mission.  ODF status signifies the complete elimination of open defecation through the use of safe sanitation technologies in every household and public institution. An ODF Plus village maintains ODF status while also implementing either solid or liquid waste management systems. An ODF Plus Model village goes further, encompassing both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and information, education, and communication (IEC) messaging.  Finally, the provided data correctly states that Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II had achieved 75% ODF Plus status in Indian villages by September 2023. Option (d) is the correct answer since it includes all the correctly matched pairs. The other options are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**5. With reference to  the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Aspect                                      Key Feature/Target
    1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education : Aims to reach at least 50% by 2035.
    2.  Undergraduate Degrees                          : Offers multiple exit options with certifications, diplomas, and degrees.
    3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)             :  Established to catalyze and expand research and innovation.
    4.  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF)  :   A platform for the free exchange of ideas on technology in education.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 has set ambitious targets and introduced significant reforms in various aspects of education.  It aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to at least 50% by 2035. The policy has restructured undergraduate degrees to offer multiple exit options, allowing students to earn certifications, diplomas, or degrees after completing varying numbers of years.  The National Research Foundation (NRF) was established to boost research and innovation across the country.  Finally, the National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) serves as a platform for sharing ideas on the effective use of technology in education.  Therefore, option (d), which includes all four correctly matched pairs, is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**6. With reference to  the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for School Education System, consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                      Key Characteristic
    1. PGI 2.0 for States/UTs                          :  Based on UDISE+ 2021-22 data and NAS 2021.
    2. PGI for Districts (PGI-D)                        :  Classifies States/UTs and districts into ten grades.
    3. Highest Grade in PGI 2.0 for States/UTs          :  Daksh (achieved by at least one State/UT).
    4.  Data Source for PGI and PGI-D                 :  Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+).


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PGI 2.0 for States/UTs and PGI for Districts (PGI-D) are indeed based on UDISE+ 2021-22 data and NAS 2021.  Both indices classify States/UTs and districts into ten grades.  However, in PGI 2.0, no State/UT achieved the highest grade, Daksh.  The data source for both PGI and PGI-D is accurately stated as UDISE+.  Therefore, option (c) is correct because it accurately reflects the characteristics of PGI 2.0, PGI-D, and their data source. Option (d) is incorrect because no State/UT attained the highest grade (Daksh) in PGI 2.0. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**7. With reference to  Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBU), consider the following pairs:**

    Regulation/Provision                                     Key Feature
    1. UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 :  Allows institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.
    2. UGC Act 1956                                         : Provides the Central Government the power to declare institutions as DtBU.
    3.  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)                      :  Compulsory creation of ABC identities for students by DtBUs.
    4. NCERT's DtBU Status                                 : Allows NCERT to offer its own graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, introduced a significant change by allowing institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.  The UGC Act 1956 provides the legal framework for the Central Government to grant DtBU status to eligible institutions.  The 2023 regulations mandate DtBUs to create ABC identities for their students and upload their credit scores.  Finally, NCERT's acquisition of DtBU status has indeed enabled it to offer its own graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees. Thus, option (d) accurately reflects all four aspects of DtBU regulations and provisions. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and, therefore, incorrect.


**8. With reference to  Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulation/Provision                                   Key Stipulation
    1. UGC [Setting up and Operation of Campuses of FHEIs in India] Regulations, 2023: Requires UGC approval for FHEIs to establish campuses in India.
    2. Eligibility Criteria for FHEIs                         : Ranked within top 500 globally (overall or subject-wise) or possessing outstanding expertise.
    3.  Programmes Offered by FHEIs in India             :  Allowed to offer online or open and distance learning programs.
    4.  FHEIs' Operations in India                         : Must comply with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (1999) and other relevant laws.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UGC regulations for foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) in India mandate UGC approval for establishing campuses and offering programs.  The eligibility criteria specify that FHEIs must be ranked within the top 500 globally or demonstrate exceptional expertise.  However, FHEIs are *not* permitted to offer online or open and distance learning programs in India.  FHEIs are required to comply with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (1999) and other relevant Indian laws.  Option (c) correctly matches the first, second, and fourth pairs.  Option (d) is incorrect because of the inaccurate statement regarding online programs.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete and, therefore, incorrect.


**9. With reference to  Manual Scavenging, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                                          Key Provision/Feature
    1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) : Bans manual scavenging.
    2. National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem : Aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning and ensure the safety and dignity of sewer and septic tank workers.
    3. Swachhta Udyami Yojana                         : Provides concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment procurement.
    4. Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) : Rehabilitates identified manual scavengers in alternative professions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), explicitly bans manual scavenging.  The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem focuses on eliminating hazardous cleaning practices and ensuring worker safety.  The Swachhta Udyami Yojana offers financial assistance for procuring sanitation equipment.  Finally, the Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) aims to rehabilitate manual scavengers through alternative employment opportunities.  Therefore, option (d) accurately reflects all four aspects of the given Acts and schemes related to manual scavenging. The other options are incomplete and incorrect.


**10. With reference to  Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

    Term/Category                                      Characteristic/Feature
    1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)   :  Centrally recognized special categories from among Scheduled Tribes.
    2. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                        : Communities previously 'notified' as 'born criminals' during the British regime.
    3.  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) : Prepares a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
    4.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs  : A centrally sponsored scheme to improve educational empowerment of DNTs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs are indeed centrally recognized special categories within Scheduled Tribes. DNTs accurately refer to communities labeled as "born criminals" during British rule. The NCDNT is responsible for creating a state-wise list of DNT castes.  The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship is a centrally sponsored scheme designed to improve the educational opportunities for DNTs.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  The other options are incomplete and incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Report Released
1. UNFPA                           :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
2. UNDESA                          :   India Ageing Report 2023
3. IFPRI                            :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition
4. WFP                             :   Global Food Policy Report 2023: Rethinking food crisis responses
5. WHO                             :   Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) releases the State of World Population report annually, not the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report." That report is published by the UNHCR.  The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) publishes various reports, including the World Social Report and World Economic Situation and Prospects Report, but not the "India Ageing Report 2023". That report is a collaboration between UNFPA and IIPS. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) releases the Global Food Policy Report,  not the "Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition". This report is published by UNDESA. The World Food Programme (WFP) publishes the Global Report on Food Crisis,  not the "Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)" report. This report is released by WHO.  Therefore, only options 4 and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                  Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana     :   Aims to provide all-weather road connectivity to unconnected habitations in rural areas
2. Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana :   Six-month stipend-based internship for unemployed youth in Maharashtra
3.  Integrated Ombudsman Scheme         :   Specifically designed for complaints arising from digital payment services
4.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission      :   Provides six-month internship to 12th pass candidates with a stipend of Rs 6,000


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) indeed aims to provide all-weather road connectivity to eligible unconnected habitations in rural areas.  The Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana is a stipend-based internship scheme for unemployed youth in Maharashtra, offering varying stipends based on educational qualifications. The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme brings together banking, NBFC, and digital transaction ombudsman schemes, not specifically focusing only on digital payment complaints. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission is a digital health initiative aimed at improving healthcare access and portability, not an internship program. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                              Provision/Focus
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021     :   Allows commercial surrogacy
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971:   Allows termination up to 24 weeks for all women
3. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Imposes a fine of up to ₹50,000 for violations
4.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 : Mandates 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, permits only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy. The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, allows pregnancy termination up to 20 weeks for all women and up to 24 weeks under specific conditions,  not 24 weeks for all. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, prescribes imprisonment up to two years or a fine up to ₹1 lakh, or both, not ₹50,000. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                Key Function/Goal
1.  POSHAN Abhiyan                     :   Launched a national Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children
2.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM)   :   Reduce stunting in identified districts with high malnutrition burden
3.  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) :   Specifically targets adolescent girls (14-18 years) in aspirational districts
4.  Saksham Anganwadis                :    Focuses on improving nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) launched the national Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children to track and help children with disabilities.  The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) aims to reduce stunting in high-malnutrition districts.  While ICDS is a broader program encompassing nutrition and healthcare for children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, Saksham Anganwadis builds upon ICDS, focusing on strengthening AWCs and expanding services to include adolescent girls in specific districts and early childhood care and education.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly link initiatives with functions that are not their primary focus.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of ODF Status                    Characteristic
1. ODF                                  :   Sustained ODF status with solid or liquid waste management systems
2. ODF Plus                             :   Arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and IEC messages
3. ODF Plus Model Village               :   No visible faeces found in the environment and every household using safe disposal technology.
4.  ODF Plus Model Village              :  Minimal litter, minimal stagnant wastewater, no plastic waste dump in public places


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) Only one
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

ODF (Open Defecation Free) status signifies the absence of open defecation,  but it doesn't inherently include waste management systems.  ODF Plus builds upon ODF, adding solid or liquid waste management. ODF Plus Model Villages go further, mandating both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and IEC messages. The description in option 3 accurately defines ODF status, not ODF Plus Model Village. Option 4 correctly describes a characteristic of ODF Plus Model Villages,  namely visual cleanliness. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly link types of ODF status with their characteristics.


**6. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

   Level                                     Description
1. Levels 1-4                              :   Higher Education
2. Levels 4.5-8                            :   Vocational Education & Training
3.  School Education                      :   Credits earned stored in Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)
4.  Experiential learning                 :   Refer to the time an average student needs to attend classes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) Only one
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Levels 1-4 in the NCrF refer to school education, not higher education.  Levels 4.5-8 encompass higher education, not vocational education & training.  Credits earned through various educational pathways are indeed stored in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC). The description in option 4 defines Notional Learning Hours, not experiential learning. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly link NCrF levels with their descriptions.


**7.  With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                     Goal/Feature
1.  National Research Foundation (NRF) :   To oversee and supervise an independent ecosystem of accrediting institutions
2.  National Accreditation Council (NAC):   To catalyse and expand research and innovation
3.  National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR):   To bring a leap in learning outcomes through data and technology
4.   Higher Education Commission of India (HECI):   To frame policies and regulate standards for governance of nursing and midwifery education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) Only two
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Research Foundation (NRF) aims to catalyze and expand research and innovation across the country. The National Accreditation Council (NAC) is envisioned to oversee and supervise an independent ecosystem of accrediting institutions. The National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) leverages data and technology to improve learning outcomes. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is not directly involved in regulating nursing and midwifery education; that falls under the purview of the National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC). Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                         Key Provision
1.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 :   Prohibits employment of children below 18 years
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :   Defines a child as a person below 16 years of age.
3.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Recognizes 21 types of disabilities
4.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021:    Allows surrogacy for foreign nationals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 prohibits the employment of children below 14 years, not 18. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, defines a child as a person below 18 years of age.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, correctly recognizes 21 types of disabilities. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, prohibits surrogacy for foreign nationals. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The other pairs contain inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the acts' provisions.


**1. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Goal                                     Specific Implementation
    1. Achieve 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education by 2035 :  Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs)
    2. Increase public investment in education to 6% of GDP :  Introduction of Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)
    3.  Enhance research and innovation :  Establishment of National Research Foundation (NRF)
    4.  Promote multilingualism :  Mandating proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two Indian languages

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims to achieve a 50% GER in higher education by 2035.  The establishment of MERUs is a key strategy to achieve this goal by expanding access to quality multidisciplinary education.  Similarly, the NEP aims to significantly increase public investment in education, targeting 6% of GDP. While ABC is a crucial component of NEP for improving educational flexibility, it's not directly linked to the increase in GDP investment. The creation of the NRF is a direct step towards boosting research and innovation as outlined in the policy. Finally, the NEP strongly promotes multilingualism in education, advocating for proficiency in at least three languages, with a focus on Indian languages.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrectly matched as ABC is related to credit transfer and flexibility, not directly to the increase in GDP allocation for education.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                      Key Provision
    1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 :  Allows surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete is from the intending couple.
    2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (as amended in 2021) :  Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women.
    3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Imposes a fine of up to ₹50,000 for employing manual scavengers.
    4.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 : Mandates at least 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced a crucial change by allowing surrogacy with donor gametes under specific conditions – at least one gamete must be from the intending couple. The MTP Act, as amended in 2021, allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women, not 24. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, mandates a fine of up to ₹1 Lakh, not ₹50,000.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, indeed mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to organizations involved in social issues, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                     Primary Focus Area
    1.  UNFPA                                          :   Combating gender-based violence
    2.  UNICEF                                         :   Providing early childhood care and development
    3.  World Food Programme (WFP)                  :   Addressing malnutrition and food insecurity
    4.  UNHCR                                          :  Protecting the rights of refugees

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA's mandate includes addressing gender-based violence and promoting sexual and reproductive health rights. UNICEF focuses on children's rights and well-being, including early childhood care and development. The WFP's primary goal is to combat hunger and malnutrition through food assistance programs. UNHCR is dedicated to protecting refugees and asylum seekers worldwide. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Initiative                      Primary Objective
    1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana                       :   Providing universal health coverage
    2.  POSHAN Abhiyan                               :   Improving maternal and child nutrition
    3.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)              :   Achieving Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status in villages
    4.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme   :   Rehabilitating child labourers

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to provide health insurance and improve access to healthcare services, contributing to universal health coverage. POSHAN Abhiyan focuses on improving nutrition among pregnant women, mothers, and children. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) aims to make villages ODF and ODF Plus. The NCLP Scheme is specifically designed to rehabilitate child labourers. Thus, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to  vulnerable sections and government initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Vulnerable Group                     Government Initiative/Act
    1.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)          :  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)
    2.  Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)  :  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)
    3.  Manual Scavengers                :  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016
    4.  Tribal Communities               :   National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is a government body specifically focused on the welfare and development of DNTs.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, addresses the rights and needs of PwDs. The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) is designed to rehabilitate manual scavengers, not PwDs in general. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem is aimed at improving sanitation infrastructure and eliminating manual scavenging, but is not specifically targeted at tribal communities. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Key Feature
1. Ayushman Bharat Yojana                  :   Focuses solely on tertiary level healthcare
2. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) :   Aims to improve access to quality healthcare through telemedicine
3. Intensified Mission Indradhanush        :   Targets pregnant women and children aged 0-6 years for vaccination
4. Saksham Anganwadis                      :   Exclusively targets adolescent girls in urban areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana (ABY) is a comprehensive health insurance scheme aiming to provide health coverage at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) leverages technology, including telemedicine, to enhance access to quality healthcare and ensure national portability of health services.  Statement 2 is thus correct. Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on achieving full vaccination coverage for children aged 0-5 years and pregnant women, aligning with statement 3. Saksham Anganwadis, while strengthening Anganwadi centers, also targets adolescent girls (14-18 years) in Aspirational Districts and the North Eastern Region (NER), making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Report/Initiative
1. World Health Organization (WHO)           :   Triple Threat Report on WASH
2. UNICEF                                      :   Burden of disease attributable to unsafe WASH
3.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan :  Global Hunger Index (GHI)
4. Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe :  India Ageing Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Organization (WHO) did not release the Triple Threat Report; that was published by UNICEF.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  UNICEF released the “Triple Threat Report” focusing on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) challenges faced by children. Statement 2 is incorrect because WHO, not UNICEF, released the report on the burden of disease attributable to unsafe WASH.  The National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) does not release the Global Hunger Index (GHI); that is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. Statement 3 is incorrect. The India Ageing Report 2023 was released by UNFPA in collaboration with IIPS, not Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. Statement 4 is incorrect.  Only statement 1 is correctly matched, although it contains an error.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                          Key Provision
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Provides for a National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016: Mandates 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs
3.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021: Allows commercial surrogacy for foreign nationals
4.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005: Defines domestic violence to include only physical abuse


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, focuses on eliminating manual scavenging, not on establishing a commission for DNTs. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4%, not 5%, reservation for PwDs in government jobs; it does not apply to police forces. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy and bans it for foreign nationals. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, defines domestic violence comprehensively, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. Statement 4 is incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Mandate/Focus
1. National Research Foundation (NRF)           :   Regulates medical education and practice in India
2. National Medical Commission (NMC)          :   Promotes research, innovation, and entrepreneurship in various fields
3. National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) :  Oversees accreditation of higher education institutions
4. University Grants Commission (UGC)         :  Develops curriculum and educational materials for schools


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Research Foundation (NRF) is tasked with promoting research, innovation, and entrepreneurship across various scientific and technological fields, not regulating medical education. Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Medical Commission (NMC) is the regulatory body for medical education and practice in India, making statement 2 correct.  NCERT is responsible for developing curriculum and educational materials for schools, not overseeing higher education institution accreditation. Statement 3 is incorrect. The University Grants Commission (UGC) accredits higher education institutions, not develops school curriculum. Statement 4 is incorrect. Thus, only pair 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                 Key Feature/Organization
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                    :   Released by the World Economic Forum
2. Global Gender Gap Index                      :   Measures economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)            :   Tracks SDG 3.8.1, including reproductive, maternal, and child health
4. Gender Social Norms Index                   :   Developed by the World Bank and WHO


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Economic Forum. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Index, released by the World Economic Forum, indeed measures economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. Statement 2 is correct. The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI), jointly released by WHO and the World Bank, accurately tracks SDG 3.8.1 and includes the mentioned health aspects. Statement 3 is correct. The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank and WHO. Statement 4 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Community Health Worker             Primary Role/Scheme
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)                : National Rural Health Mission
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)          : Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) : Provides early childhood care and development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) are primarily associated with the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), not the National Rural Health Mission. Statement 1 is incorrect. Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) are integral to the National Rural/Urban Health Mission (under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare), not ICDS. Statement 2 is incorrect. Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) play a crucial role in creating awareness about health factors, counseling families, and providing basic healthcare services at the village level.  Statement 3 is correct. Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Headquarters Location
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Geneva, Switzerland
2. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Washington, D.C., USA
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA
4. UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)     :   Rome, Italy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The correct headquarters locations are as follows:

* **International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI):** Washington, D.C., USA
* **United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR):** Geneva, Switzerland
* **Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI):** Geneva, Switzerland
* **UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII):** New York, USA

All the pairs provided in the question incorrectly match the organizations with their headquarters.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. The question tests factual recall of the headquarters of prominent international organizations working on social issues.  Understanding the locations of these organizations is crucial for comprehending their operational reach and influence on global policy.  Incorrectly associating an organization with a wrong location demonstrates a lack of basic factual knowledge. The distractors are carefully chosen to include plausible but incorrect locations, making the question challenging and requiring precise knowledge.


**2. With reference to global indices related to social issues, consider the following pairs:**

   Index Name                                      Releasing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index                       :   United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index                      :   World Economic Forum
3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) :   World Health Organization and World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The correct releasing organizations for the indices are:

* **Global Gender Gap Index:** World Economic Forum
* **Gender Social Norms Index:** United Nations Development Programme
* **Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI):** World Health Organization and World Bank

Only pair 3 correctly matches the index with its releasing organization. Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect because they wrongly associate the releasing organizations with the indices. This question assesses factual recall of the organizations responsible for releasing prominent global indices related to gender equality and health.  Knowing the source of these indices is critical for understanding their methodologies and interpreting their findings within the broader context of global development goals.  Incorrectly attributing an index to the wrong organization highlights a gap in understanding the landscape of global social indicators.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the sources of these important indices.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Key Feature
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021             :   Allows commercial surrogacy
2. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Permits manual scavenging with protective gear
3. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :   Mandates 5% reservation in police forces for PwDs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The key features of the acts/policies are:

* **Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021:** Allows only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy.
* **Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:** Prohibits manual scavenging but allows cleaning of human waste with appropriate protective gear.
* **Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:** Mandates reservation for PwDs in government jobs and educational institutions but excludes police forces.

Only pair 2 correctly describes a key feature of the relevant act. Pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect as they misrepresent the key provisions of the Surrogacy Act and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act respectively.  This question evaluates the candidate's understanding of specific provisions within important social legislation in India.  Accurate knowledge of these laws is essential for analyzing their impact on vulnerable populations and evaluating their effectiveness in addressing social issues.  The incorrect pairs highlight common misconceptions about the scope and limitations of these acts, making the question challenging and requiring detailed knowledge.


**4. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                         Primary Implementing Ministry
1. Saksham Anganwadis                        :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2. Poshan Abhiyan                             :   Ministry of Rural Development
3. National Nutrition Mission (NNM)          :   Ministry of Women and Child Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The primary implementing ministries for these programs are:

* **Saksham Anganwadis:** Ministry of Women and Child Development
* **Poshan Abhiyan:** Ministry of Women and Child Development
* **National Nutrition Mission (NNM):** Ministry of Women and Child Development

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly attribute the implementation of these initiatives to different ministries. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the governmental structure and responsibility in implementing crucial social welfare programs related to child nutrition and development.  Understanding the ministry responsible for each program is crucial for analyzing policy implementation and resource allocation.  The incorrect pairs are designed to be plausible, testing the candidate’s precise knowledge of the ministries involved.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                      Report Published
1. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)           :   Global Report on Food Crisis
2. World Food Programme (WFP)                       :   State of World Population Report
3. UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The correct pairings of organizations and their published reports are:

* **United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA):** State of World Population Report
* **World Food Programme (WFP):** Global Report on Food Crisis
* **UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA):** Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report

Only pair 3 accurately links the organization to the report it publishes. Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly associate the organizations with the wrong reports. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the roles and functions of various UN agencies involved in publishing reports on global development issues.  Understanding the specific reports produced by each agency is important for analyzing global trends and policy responses to social and economic challenges.  The incorrect options test the candidate's detailed knowledge of UN agency publications.


**1. With reference to the Indian social landscape, consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                     Key Feature
1. Global Gender Gap Index                       :   Released by the United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index                     :   Measures women's empowerment solely
3. UHC Service Coverage Index                    :   Tracks SDG 3.8.1
4. Path to Equal Report                           :   Includes the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) and Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.  The Gender Social Norms Index is indeed released by the UNDP and seeks to understand systematic disadvantages faced by women. The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) accurately tracks SDG 3.8.1, focusing on health service coverage. The Path to Equal Report is a joint initiative of UN Women and UNDP, and it does indeed introduce the Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) to measure women's empowerment and gender equality. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because the Global Gender Gap Index is not released by the UNDP. Option (b) is incorrect because the Gender Social Norms Index does not measure women's empowerment solely; it considers various dimensions. Option (d) is incorrect because while the Path to Equal Report is correctly matched, the Global Gender Gap Index and the Gender Social Norms Index are incorrectly paired.


**2. With reference to the welfare of marginalized communities in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Community/Group                              Characteristic
1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :   First recognized in 2006
2. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                       :   Nomadic tribes are not DNTs
3. Manual Scavengers                             :   Employment banned under PEMSR Act, 2013
4.  Hakki Pikki Tribe                             :   Centrally recognized special category

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs were first recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), not in 2006.  The statement that all nomadic tribes are not DNTs, but all DNTs are nomadic tribes is correct. The employment of manual scavengers is indeed banned under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR). The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group, not a centrally recognized special category like PVTGs.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect due to the incorrect year for PVTG recognition. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of DNTs and the prohibition of manual scavenging. Option (d) is incorrect because of the incorrect classification of the Hakki Pikki tribe and the incorrect year for PVTG recognition.


**3. With reference to initiatives aimed at improving nutrition and sanitation in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                   Objective
1. Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II      :   Achieve ODF Plus status in 75% of villages
2. Saksham Anganwadis                              :   Focus solely on improving nutrition of children aged 0-6 years
3. POSHAN Abhiyan                                 :   Reduce stunting in districts with high malnutrition
4. National Nutrition Mission (NNM)               :  Improve utilization of key Anganwadi services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II aims to achieve ODF Plus status in a significant portion of Indian villages.  Saksham Anganwadis have a broader focus than just children aged 0-6 years; they also address adolescent girls and early childhood care and education. POSHAN Abhiyan's primary goal is to reduce stunting in high-malnutrition districts.  The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan does indeed aim to improve the utilization of key Anganwadi services.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of POSHAN Abhiyan and NNM. Option (c) is incorrect because of the inaccurate description of Saksham Anganwadis. Option (d) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of NNM.


**4. With reference to the governance of social issues in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                    Responsibility/Function
1. Ministry of Tribal Affairs                          :   Oversees the National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomoadic Tribes (NCDNT)
2. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)        :   Accredited by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
3.  Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment        :   Oversees the Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD
4.  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) :   Issues guidelines for assessment of child suspects in heinous offenses

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is responsible for tribal welfare, including PVTGs. However, the NCDNT is under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The NHRC's accreditation by GANHRI has been deferred multiple times, indicating an incomplete or uncertain status. The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment correctly oversees the Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD. The NCPCR does indeed issue guidelines for the assessment of child suspects in heinous offenses. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect due to the incorrect ministry responsible for the NCDNT. Option (b) is incorrect because of the uncertain accreditation status of the NHRC. Option (d) is incorrect because of the incorrect ministry responsible for the NCDNT.


**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                       Key Provision
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021              :   Allows commercial surrogacy
2. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 :   Defines domestic violence to include only physical abuse
3.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :   Allows termination of pregnancy up to 28 weeks in all cases
4.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:  Provides for rehabilitation of manual scavengers through training and financial assistance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, allows only altruistic surrogacy, not commercial surrogacy. The PWDVA, 2005, defines domestic violence to include physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse, not only physical abuse. The MTP Act, 1971, has amendments that allow termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women and up to 24 weeks in specific cases; it does not allow termination up to 28 weeks in all cases.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 correctly provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through training and financial assistance. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.  The other options incorrectly pair Acts with provisions that do not accurately reflect the legislation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Ministry
1. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0     :    Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP)   :    Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM)        :    Ministry of Labour and Employment
4.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs : Ministry of Tribal Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, focusing on improving nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) is indeed a Central Sector scheme under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, aimed at rehabilitating child labourers. The National Nutrition Mission (NNM), also known as POSHAN Abhiyaan, is a flagship program of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, focusing on improving nutritional levels. The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs (Denotified Tribes) is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, designed to improve the educational empowerment of DNTs. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly match at least one scheme with its responsible ministry, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the governmental structure and responsibilities.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act                                         Prominent Feature
1.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021        :   Allows only commercial surrogacy
2.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 : Defines domestic violence narrowly, excluding economic abuse
3.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Does not address the issue of rehabilitation of manual scavengers
4.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016 :  Permits employment of children below 14 years in certain industries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, has a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013,  specifically includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment, financial assistance, and property acquisition. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, strictly prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all forms of employment. All the pairs provided contain at least one incorrect statement, highlighting the importance of thorough understanding of each legislation.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                                     Specific Aim
1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target           :   Reach 100% by 2030 at the secondary level
2.  Multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees :   Allow students to exit with a diploma after one year
3.  Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) :   Promote interdisciplinary learning and research
4.  National Research Foundation (NRF)            :   Restrict research funding to specific STEM fields

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) to 50% in higher education by 2035, not 100% at the secondary level by 2030.  The policy does allow for multiple exit options, including a diploma after two years, not one year, and a bachelor's degree after three years. The establishment of MERUs is indeed intended to foster interdisciplinary learning and research. The National Research Foundation (NRF) aims to catalyze and expand research and innovation across various fields, not solely restricting it to STEM.  Option (b) correctly identifies two pairs where the policy feature and its aim are accurately matched, demonstrating a solid grasp of NEP's key components.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization                                   Key Report/Initiative
1.  UNFPA                                        :   Global Gender Gap Index
2.  UNDESA                                       :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3.  World Economic Forum                       :   State of World Population Report 2023
4.  World Health Organization                    :    Triple Threat Report on WASH

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) publishes the State of World Population report, not the Global Gender Gap Index.  The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) indeed releases the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report. The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index, not the SDG Progress Report. UNICEF, not WHO, released the Triple Threat Report on WASH.  Option (b) accurately connects UNDESA with its report and UNICEF with its report on WASH, demonstrating knowledge of these organizations' areas of focus.


**5. With reference to Tribal welfare in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Category                                    Characteristic
1.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :  Constitute the majority of the Scheduled Tribe population
2.  Scheduled Tribes (STs)                     :  Identified based on pre-agricultural technology and low literacy
3.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                   :   Officially designated as criminal tribes during British rule
4.  Nomadic Tribes (NTs)                       : All nomadic tribes are also Denotified Tribes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs are a specific category *within* the Scheduled Tribes, not the majority.  The criteria for identifying Scheduled Tribes are broader than just pre-agricultural technology and low literacy. Denotified Tribes were indeed labeled as criminal tribes during British rule.  Not all nomadic tribes are Denotified Tribes; they are distinct categories. Only pair 3 accurately reflects the factual relationship between the category and its characteristic.  The other options demonstrate misunderstandings regarding the classification and characteristics of these tribal groups.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State
1. Bharia PVTG                            :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                             :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga Tribe                              :   Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  However, the question plays on the fact that some PVTGs are present in multiple states.  While the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, only the Bharia tribe's presence in Chhattisgarh is correctly matched in option 1.  Option (b) is incorrect because, while Kamar is a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh, the pairing is incomplete as Kamar is also present in Chhattisgarh.  Option (c) is incorrect as Baiga is a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, not Odisha. Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs overall, but this does not mean that Baiga is exclusively located there. Option (d) is incorrect because of the inaccuracies in pairings 2 and 3. The question successfully tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the geographical distribution of specific PVTGs, avoiding easy generalizations.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs         :    Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology     :   Use of advanced farming techniques
2. Low level of literacy                    :    High literacy rates
3. Economic backwardness                 :    High economic prosperity
4. Declining or stagnant population       :     Rapid population growth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are designed to pinpoint groups with limited access to modern technologies, low literacy rates, economic hardship, and population challenges. Option 1 incorrectly links pre-agricultural technology to advanced farming techniques. Option 2 wrongly associates low literacy with high literacy rates. Option 3 contrasts economic backwardness with high economic prosperity.  Finally, Option 4 juxtaposes a declining or stagnant population with rapid population growth.  The question's difficulty stems from the need for precise knowledge of the PVTG identification criteria and the use of plausible but incorrect distractors that mirror the actual criteria but present their opposites.  The correct answer highlights the importance of accurate understanding of the defining characteristics of PVTGs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                               :   Key Feature
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :  Criminalizes marital rape.
2.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:  ODF Plus status implementation
3.  Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019  :   Allows self-perception of gender identity.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, allows individuals to self-identify their gender. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, addresses domestic violence but does not criminalize marital rape; this is a separate legal debate. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act focuses on eliminating manual scavenging, not on the ODF Plus status, which is a component of the Swachh Bharat Mission.  The question effectively differentiates between the specific provisions of different acts, requiring precise understanding of the legal frameworks and avoiding superficial knowledge.  The distractors are relevant to social issues but incorrectly linked to the specific acts.


**4. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

    NEP 2020 Feature                          :   Specific Target/Goal
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education :  100% by 2030
2. Multiple exit options in Undergraduate degrees :  Flexibility and mobility among school, higher and vocational education
3. National Research Foundation (NRF)         :   Boosting research and innovation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The NEP 2020 aims to increase the GER in higher education to 50% by 2035, not 100% by 2030 (that target is for school education).  The multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees indeed enhance flexibility. The National Research Foundation (NRF) is established to boost research and innovation. The question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the NEP 2020's provisions and goals, differentiating between closely related targets and timelines. The inclusion of a partially correct pair (multiple exit options) among the distractors increases the question's difficulty level.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                               :    Key Publication/Report
1. UNFPA                                      :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022
2. UNDESA                                     :   India Ageing Report 2023
3. IFPRI                                      :   Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The UNFPA publishes the State of World Population report, not the forced displacement report.  UNDESA releases the World Social Report and other SDG related reports, not the India Ageing Report (that's UNFPA in collaboration with IIPS). The IFPRI releases the Global Food Policy Report, not the SDG progress report.  This question tests the ability to recall specific organizations and their key publications, requiring a precise knowledge of the mandates and activities of international organizations. The distractors are created by strategically assigning reports to organizations that have a thematic overlap, but not the actual authorship.


**6. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   GHI Aspect                               :  India's 2023 Data
1. GHI Rank                                  :   125th
2. GHI Score                                 :   28.7
3. Category on Severity of Hunger Scale    :   Severe


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. India's GHI score in 2023 was 28.7.  However, India's rank was 107th out of 121 countries, not 125th.  Additionally, India was categorized as "Serious," not "Severe," on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale. This question tests knowledge about the GHI report's specific numerical data and classifications, requiring precise recall rather than general understanding. The distractors involve manipulating the numerical data and categorical labels to create plausible but inaccurate options.  The question's difficulty lies in the close proximity of the incorrect numerical data to the correct values.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Initiative             :     Ministry/Department
1. PM JANMAN                                :    Ministry of Rural Development
2. Saksham Anganwadis                       :    Ministry of Women and Child Development
3. National Nutrition Mission (NNM)        :    Ministry of Health and Family Welfare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. Saksham Anganwadis falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. PM JANMAN, while related to tribal welfare, is a multi-ministry initiative, not solely under the Ministry of Rural Development.  The National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) is primarily under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, although there is inter-ministerial collaboration. The question necessitates a clear understanding of the administrative responsibilities of various government ministries and the schemes they oversee. The distractors involve ministries with related but not exact responsibilities, increasing the difficulty level.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                           Headquarters Location
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Geneva, Switzerland
2. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Washington, D.C., USA
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA
4. UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) : Rome, Italy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is headquartered in New York, USA.  Therefore, only the pair relating UNHCR to its headquarters location is correctly matched. The other pairs present incorrect headquarters locations for the respective organizations.  Understanding the locations of key international organizations is crucial for comprehending global governance and international relations, a vital aspect of the UPSC exam.


**2. With reference to the 2023 Global Hunger Index, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                  GHI Score & Category
1. India                                     :  27.0, Serious
2. South Asia                               :  28.7, Serious
3. Sub-Saharan Africa                       :  29.2, Alert
4.  China                                   :  28.7, Serious

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

In the 2023 Global Hunger Index, India's GHI score was 28.7, categorized as "Serious." South Asia also had a GHI score of 27.0, categorized as "Serious".  Sub-Saharan Africa had a GHI score of 27.0, also categorized as "Serious".  The GHI score for China is not directly provided in the source.  Therefore, none of the pairs except for the possible score of China are correctly matched as presented. This question highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of global hunger indices and their regional variations, a key area for the UPSC exam. The ability to critically evaluate presented data and identify inaccuracies is also essential.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Key Provision/Focus
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005  :  Criminalizes marital rape
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (amended 2021) : Allows abortion up to 24 weeks for all women
3.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) :  Defines manual scavenging solely as handling undecomposed human waste
4.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 : Permits commercial surrogacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provides civil remedies for domestic violence but does not explicitly criminalize marital rape. The MTP Act, as amended in 2021, allows abortion up to 24 weeks under specific conditions. However, the statement in the pair is an oversimplification and not completely accurate.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, defines manual scavenging more broadly than just handling undecomposed human waste. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, specifically prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. Therefore, only the second pair, though with a slight simplification, is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of social legislation in India and the need for precise understanding of legal provisions, crucial for the UPSC exam.


**4. With reference to the Anganwadi System, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                     Ministry/Department
1.  POSHAN Abhiyaan                       : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0    : Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children : Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush       : Ministry of Women and Child Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

POSHAN Abhiyaan is a program under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children is also launched by Ministry of Women and Child Development. Intensified Mission Indradhanush is a health initiative under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched.  This question assesses the understanding of government schemes related to child welfare and their administrative structures, a crucial aspect of the UPSC exam. The ability to correctly identify the responsible ministries for various schemes is tested.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking/Index                                   Releasing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Index                         : United Nations Development Programme
2. Gender Social Norms Index                        : World Economic Forum
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)                 : WHO and World Bank
4. Path to Equal Report                             :  Jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum. The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the United Nations Development Programme. The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) is jointly released by the WHO and the World Bank. The Path to Equal Report is jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of various global indices and their releasing bodies, demonstrating the ability to link different organizations with their respective publications and initiatives.  This is essential for understanding global development trends, a key area for the UPSC exam.



**6. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                             Specific Target/Goal
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education : Increase to 100% by 2030
2. Multiple exit options in Undergraduate degrees :  Provide certification, diploma, and Bachelor's degrees
3.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                    : Digitally store academic credits from various institutions
4. National Research Foundation (NRF)              : Primarily focus on school education curriculum

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims to increase the GER in higher education to 50% by 2035, not 100% by 2030.  The policy does introduce multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees, allowing students to earn certifications, diplomas, and Bachelor's degrees at different stages. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is designed to digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions. The National Research Foundation (NRF) is focused on research and innovation across the country, not solely on school education.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests understanding of the NEP 2020, its key features, and targets.  The ability to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate interpretations of policy goals is essential for the UPSC exam.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                                    State/Region (PVTG Status)
1. Bharia                                         :  Madhya Pradesh only
2. Kamar                                          : Chhattisgarh only
3. Baiga                                          :  Both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
4. Hakki Pikki                                     : Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia and Baiga tribal groups are recognized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The Kamar tribe is also a PVTG in both states. The Hakki Pikki are a semi-nomadic tribal group primarily found in Karnataka.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of tribal groups in India and their geographical distribution, specifically focusing on PVTGs.  Understanding the socio-economic context of vulnerable communities is crucial for the UPSC exam.


**8. With reference to the  Caste Census, consider the following pairs:**

   Census Related Information                     Source/Act
1.  Full-scale caste enumeration               : Census Act of 1948
2.  Caste-wise data collection (unpublished) :  1941 Census
3.  Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011 :  Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, and Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India.
4.  Estimation of OBC population at 52%       : First Backward Classes Commission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Census Act of 1948 provides a framework for conducting population censuses, but it doesn't mandate full-scale caste enumeration.  The 1941 census did collect caste-wise data, but it was not published. The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011, involved multiple ministries and the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India. The estimation of the OBC population at 52% was done by the Second Backward Classes Commission (Mandal Commission), not the First.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of the history and methodology of caste-based data collection in India, an important topic for the UPSC exam.  The ability to distinguish between different sources of data and their limitations is essential.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                     State/Union Territory
1. Bharia PVTG                     :    Odisha
2. Kamar PVTG                      :    Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                       :    Chhattisgarh
4. Hakki Pikki Tribe                :    Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic tribal group from Karnataka, and the Baiga tribe is listed as a PVTG in Chhattisgarh.  The other options are incorrect due to mismatched pairings.  The Bharia PVTG is primarily associated with Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  While the Baiga and Kamar tribes are found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the question specifically asks for correct matchings, and listing Madhya Pradesh for Kamar and Chhattisgarh for Baiga is not entirely accurate representation of their distribution. Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs, but this does not mean that all PVTGs are present there. The question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups within India, highlighting the need for detailed understanding beyond general statements.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                      Ministry/Organization
1.  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 : Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme : Ministry of Labour and Employment
3.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
4.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana          : Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, and the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, is managed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Option (a) is incorrect because the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, does not fall under the Ministry of Women and Child Development; it is primarily under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  Option (c) is incorrect because Ayushman Bharat Yojana is under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the administrative responsibilities of different ministries concerning social welfare schemes and legislation, demanding precise factual recall.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                           Key Provision/Feature
1.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :  Reservation for PwDs in police forces
2.  National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 :  Establishment of the National Research Foundation (NRF)
3.  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) :  5+3+3+4 schooling structure
4.  National Credit Framework (NCrF) :   Integration of credits from school, higher, and vocational education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is the correct answer.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, does *not* include reservation for PwDs in police forces; this is a deliberate distractor. The NEP 2020 did indeed lead to the establishment of the NRF.  The NCF-SE introduced the 5+3+3+4 schooling structure. The NCrF aims to integrate credits across different educational pathways.  Understanding the nuances of these policies and acts requires careful analysis and precise knowledge. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between correct and incorrect statements related to significant educational and social welfare policies, emphasizing the need for accurate factual recall and understanding.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                        Key Report/Initiative
1.  UNFPA                              :   Global Hunger Index (GHI)
2.  IFPRI                               :   Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
3.  UNHCR                              :   Global Food Policy Report 2023
4.  World Health Organization (WHO)   :   Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only option (d) is correct. The World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the World Bank, released the "Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring Report."  The other options incorrectly pair organizations with reports they did not produce.  The UNFPA releases the State of World Population report, not the GHI.  The IFPRI publishes the Global Food Policy Report, not the UNHCR displacement report. The UNHCR publishes reports on refugee trends, not food policy. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations and their key publications, requiring accurate recall of specific reports and their issuing bodies.  The inclusion of plausible distractors makes this a challenging question, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between closely related organizations and their areas of expertise.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                       Key Feature/Finding
1. Global Gender Gap Index 2023     : India ranked 146th
2. Gender Social Norms Index       : Measures political, educational, economic and physical integrity dimensions
3. UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) :  Tracks SDG 3.8.1
4. Path to Equal Report              : Introduces Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) and Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct.  The Gender Social Norms Index does indeed measure the four dimensions listed. The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) tracks SDG 3.8.1.  The Path to Equal Report introduced both the WEI and GGPI. However, India's rank in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index was 127, not 146, making option (a) and (c) incorrect.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various indices and reports related to gender equality and health, requiring precise recall of their features and findings and highlighting the importance of accuracy in interpreting data from these sources. The question's difficulty stems from the need to distinguish between accurate and slightly inaccurate data points related to rankings and index components.


**6. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

   Worker Category                      Key Responsibility/Benefit
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)            : Primarily focuses on promotion of maternal and child health
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)      :  Receives task-based incentives under POSHAN Abhiyan
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) : Paid leave and reservation in promotions
4. Anganwadi Helper (AWH)            : Covered under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) both receive benefits such as paid leave, reservation in promotions, and insurance coverage under schemes like Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana.  The other pairings are incorrect. ANMs primarily focus on maternal and child health, but their incentive structure is not exclusively tied to POSHAN Abhiyan. AWWs are crucial for early childhood care and development, but they also have a role in maternal and child health. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the roles and benefits associated with various community health workers within the Anganwadi system, demanding a nuanced understanding of their functions and the schemes they are covered under. The careful selection of distractors makes the question challenging, requiring precise knowledge to avoid mismatches.


**7. With reference to the ODF (Open Defecation Free) status, consider the following pairs:**

   ODF Status Type                     Defining Characteristic
1. ODF                                 :  Every household uses safe sanitation technology
2. ODF Plus                            :  Sustained ODF status with solid waste management
3. ODF Plus Model Village            : Minimal litter and stagnant wastewater in public areas
4. ODF Plus Model Village            : Arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct.  The basic ODF status requires every household to utilize safe sanitation technology.  ODF Plus involves maintaining ODF status while implementing waste management systems.  An ODF Plus Model Village goes further, ensuring visual cleanliness and implementing both solid and liquid waste management.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the different levels of sanitation achievement under the Swachh Bharat Mission, demanding precise knowledge of the criteria for each status level. The inclusion of very similar-sounding options increases the question's difficulty, requiring careful attention to detail to avoid errors.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

  Higher Education Institution Type      Key Feature/Regulation
1. Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) :   Can only start new courses after 20 years of existence
2.  Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) : Must be ranked among the top 500 globally
3.  National Accreditation Council (NAC) : Oversees and supervises accrediting institutions
4.  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)     : Stores credits earned through vocational training only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only option (c) is correct. The National Accreditation Council (NAC) is indeed the meta-accrediting body overseeing other accrediting institutions. The other options contain inaccuracies. DTBUs can now apply for the status even if they are less than 20 years old. FHEIs need UGC approval but the top 500 ranking is a criterion, not a strict requirement. The ABC stores credits from various educational pathways, not just vocational training. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of regulations and features related to higher education institutions in India, requiring accurate understanding of the criteria and processes involved in establishing and accrediting these institutions. The use of distractors, including partially true statements, makes this a challenging question, requiring in-depth knowledge to select the only completely correct option.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                     Headquarters
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) : Geneva, Switzerland
2. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Washington, D.C., USA
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct headquarters for IFPRI is Washington, D.C., USA.  UNHCR's headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland.  GANHRI is also headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. None of the pairs provided are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of the headquarters of these important international organizations, requiring precise knowledge to identify the inaccuracies.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are designed as plausible distractors, leveraging the familiarity of these organizations' general fields of work but deliberately mismatching them with their actual locations. This design makes simple guessing less effective and necessitates a deeper understanding of the organizations.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

Indicator                                       2023 Value for India
1. Undernourishment                          : 18.7%
2. Child Stunting                               : 35.5%
3. Child Wasting                                : 3.1%
4. Child Mortality                              : 16.6%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 GHI report for India correctly states that child stunting was 35.5%. The other values are incorrect. Undernourishment was 16.6%, child wasting was 18.7%, and child mortality was 3.1%. The question tests the ability to recall specific numerical data from a complex report, requiring precise knowledge to distinguish between closely related figures. The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, making it challenging to identify the correct pair without a thorough understanding of the GHI data.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the indicators and their potential confusion among similar values.


**3. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following pairs:**

Worker Category                        Key Role
1. Anganwadi Worker (AWW)              :  Focuses primarily on maternal and child health, including immunizations.
2. Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)        : Provides early childhood care and development.
3. Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) : Creates awareness on health determinants and counsels families.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

AWWs are primarily involved in providing early childhood care and development services, while ANMs focus on maternal and child health, including immunizations. ASHAs play a crucial role in creating awareness and counseling families on various health aspects.  The question tests the understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different community health workers within the Anganwadi system. The correct answer highlights the specific functions of AWWs and ASHAs, while the incorrect options deliberately confuse the roles of these workers. This design necessitates a clear understanding of the respective functions to arrive at the correct answer.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy                                      Prominent Feature
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 : Defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse.
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971  : Allows abortion up to 24 weeks under any circumstance.
3. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021             : Permits commercial surrogacy.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005 encompasses various forms of domestic violence, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, allows abortion up to 20 weeks for all and under specific conditions up to 24 weeks. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, only allows altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy. The question tests knowledge of key legislation related to women's rights and reproductive health.  All the pairs are incorrectly matched, highlighting potential misconceptions about the scope and provisions of these acts. This design tests the candidates' precise knowledge of the legislation, making it challenging to guess the correct answer.


**5.  With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

Policy Aspect                                    Target/Feature
1. Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education : 100% by 2030
2. Multiple Exit Options in Undergraduate Degrees :  Certificates, diplomas, and bachelor's degrees.
3. National Research Foundation (NRF)             :  To primarily fund research in humanities.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 aims for a 50% GER in higher education by 2035, not 100% by 2030.  The policy does indeed introduce multiple exit options with certificates, diplomas, and bachelor's degrees.  The NRF is intended to support research across various disciplines, including sciences, technology, engineering, medicine, social sciences, and humanities. The question tests the understanding of the NEP 2020 and its key features.  The distractors are strategically placed to challenge the candidate's recollection of the specific targets and features of the policy.  Only option (b) correctly identifies one of the matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                     Report Published
1. UNFPA                                         : Global Report on Food Crisis
2. WFP                                            : India Ageing Report 2023
3. IFPRI                                          : Global Food Policy Report 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA publishes the State of World Population report, not the Global Report on Food Crisis.  The WFP is known for its work on food security, but the India Ageing Report 2023 was published by UNFPA in collaboration with IIPS.  IFPRI correctly published the Global Food Policy Report 2023. The question tests the ability to link organizations to their respective publications.  The distractors are designed to create confusion by associating organizations with reports related to their general area of work, but not their specific publications.  Only option (b) accurately identifies the correct match.


**7. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), consider the following pairs:**

Indicator                                           Source/Related Organization
1.  Global Gender Gap Index                        :  United Nations Development Programme
2.  Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index : World Health Organization and World Bank
3.  Gender Social Norms Index                       : World Economic Forum


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is published by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.  The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index is indeed a joint publication of the WHO and the World Bank. The Gender Social Norms Index is published by UNDP.  The question tests knowledge of various indices related to SDGs and the organizations responsible for their publication. The distractors are designed to be plausible, making it challenging to identify the correct match without in-depth knowledge. Only option (b) accurately reflects the correct source of the UHC SCI.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Scheme/Initiative                     Primary Focus Area
1.  Saksham Anganwadis                          :  Improving nutrition among pregnant women only
2.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush             :  Reducing child mortality due to vaccine-preventable diseases
3.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)      :  Enhancing access to quality healthcare through digital means


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Saksham Anganwadis aim to improve the overall well-being of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, not just pregnant women. Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on improving immunization coverage, thereby reducing child mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases. ABDM aims to improve healthcare access through digital technologies.  The question tests knowledge of government schemes related to healthcare and nutrition. The distractors are intended to challenge the candidate's understanding of the schemes' specific objectives.  Only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to the Manual Scavenging, consider the following pairs:**

Act/Scheme                                       Key Provision/Objective
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Focuses solely on urban areas.
2. Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) :  Provides financial assistance for alternative employment.
3. NAMASTE scheme                               : Aims to completely eliminate manual scavenging.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PEMSR Act, 2013, applies to both urban and rural areas.  SRMS indeed provides financial assistance for alternative employment to manual scavengers.  NAMASTE aims to promote mechanization and eliminate manual scavenging.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the legislation and schemes related to manual scavenging. The distractors are designed to test the precise knowledge of the act's scope and the schemes' objectives. Options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

Caste-Based Data Collection in India                  Characteristic
1. 1881 Census                                     :  Caste-wise data was first collected.
2. 1941 Census                                     :  Caste-based data was collected but not published.
3. Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011 :  Caste data was fully published in 2016.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 1881 census marked the beginning of caste-wise enumeration in India.  In 1941, caste data was gathered, but it was not publicly released. The SECC 2011 data, excluding caste data, was published in 2016. The question tests knowledge of the history of caste-based data collection in India.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's understanding of the specifics of data collection and publication. Only options 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Headquarters
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Geneva, Switzerland
2. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Washington, D.C., USA
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is headquartered in Washington, D.C., USA.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The incorrect placement of headquarters for IFPRI and GANHRI acts as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of these organizations.  Understanding the locations of key international organizations is crucial for UPSC, as questions often involve the interplay between international bodies and national policies.


**2. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan), consider the following pairs:**

   Component                                      Key Feature
1.  Poshan Tracker                               :  A six-tier dashboard replacing registers with smartphones
2.  Saksham Anganwadis                          :  Focuses solely on improving AWCs for children aged 0-6 years
3.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush            :  Aims to reduce stunting in districts with high malnutrition burden

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Poshan Tracker is indeed a mobile-based application used for efficient service delivery and monitoring of nutrition programs, utilizing a six-tier dashboard that replaces physical registers. Saksham Anganwadis, while focused on improving Anganwadi Centers (AWCs), also expands to include adolescent girls and early childhood care and education, going beyond just the 0-6 age group.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush is a vaccination program, separate from the core goals of POSHAN Abhiyaan's focus on reducing malnutrition through improved utilization of Anganwadi services. Thus, only pair 1 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the specific components and functionalities within the POSHAN Abhiyan and related initiatives. The distractors highlight the interconnectedness of different government schemes, requiring careful differentiation.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                    Specific Aspect
1.  Reservation in Government jobs             :   Minimum 5% reservation in higher educational institutions
2.  Definition of "Person with benchmark disability":   At least 40% of specified disability
3.  Special Courts                               :   Established in every district for faster case adjudication

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with disabilities, not 5%.  The definition of "Person with benchmark disability" accurately describes individuals with at least 40% of a specified disability. The Act does establish special courts in every district for faster adjudication of cases.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the provisions within the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act.  The inclusion of a slightly altered figure for job reservations serves as a strong distractor, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of the Act's stipulations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Primary Focus
1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 :  Criminalizes sexual intercourse through deceitful means
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971  :  Regulates termination of pregnancies up to 24 weeks under specific conditions
3.  Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023             :  Provides civil remedies for marital rape

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, focuses on providing civil remedies for domestic violence, not criminalizing sexual intercourse through deceitful means. That falls under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, accurately regulates the termination of pregnancies under specified conditions, including the extension to 24 weeks in certain cases as amended. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, while addressing domestic violence, does not solely provide civil remedies for marital rape; it also criminalizes it.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between the specific provisions of various laws related to women's rights and protection.  The inclusion of aspects from other acts within the descriptions serves as a key distractor, requiring precise knowledge of the legal framework.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                      Measurement in India (GHI 2023)
1. Undernourishment                             :  18.7%
2. Child Wasting                                 :  35.5%
3. Child Stunting                                 :  16.6%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

According to the GHI 2023, the measurements for India are: Undernourishment – 16.6%, Child Stunting – 35.5%, and Child Wasting – 18.7%.  None of the pairs provided match the actual data. This question tests the candidate's recall of precise numerical data from a specific report. The close proximity of the incorrect figures to the correct ones creates challenging distractors, highlighting the importance of accurate data retention for UPSC preparation.  The ability to recall precise data from reports is a key skill for effectively analyzing socio-economic trends.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                       Implementing Ministry
1.  Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) : Ministry of Women and Child Development
2.  Saksham Anganwadis                          : Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship
3.  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) falls under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. Saksham Anganwadis are implemented under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan is a multi-ministerial initiative, but its primary implementing ministry is the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the implementing ministries for various government schemes, requiring an understanding of the organizational structure of the Indian government.  The inclusion of plausible alternative ministries for the other schemes acts as a significant distractor.


**7. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Key Feature
1.  Number of State Parties                     :  196
2.  Monitoring Body                             :  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child
3.  Adoption Year                               :  1989


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) has indeed been ratified by 196 state parties. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child is the body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the convention. The convention was adopted in 1989. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of a key international human rights convention and its associated mechanisms.  The inclusion of accurate information across all three pairs makes this a challenging question, requiring comprehensive knowledge of the UNCRC.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Category of Nomadic Tribes                Example Tribe
1. Hunter/trappers                            : Hakki Pikki
2. Pastoral communities                       : Konda Reddis
3. Peripatetic groups of peddlers             : Gujjars

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Hakki Pikki are a semi-nomadic tribe, but primarily known for their traditional occupations, not hunting and trapping. Konda Reddis are indeed an example of a hunter-gatherer tribal group.  Gujjars are primarily a pastoral community. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the diverse categories and examples of nomadic tribes in India, requiring knowledge beyond a general understanding of nomadic lifestyles.  The inclusion of tribes that belong to other categories serves as a key distractor.


**9. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    State                                    Specific Feature
1.  Lakshadweep                               :  Highest percentage of ST population
2.  Madhya Pradesh                           :  Highest number of PVTGs
3.  Odisha                                    :  Highest number of ST population in absolute numbers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lakshadweep does have the highest percentage of ST population. Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of STs in absolute terms, not Odisha. Odisha houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), not Madhya Pradesh. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the distribution of Scheduled Tribes across different states in India, requiring both percentage and absolute number comparisons.  The deliberate mixing of state features acts as a strong distractor.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Report Published
1.  UNFPA                                      :  Global Report on Food Crisis
2.  UNDESA                                     :  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
3.  WFP                                        :  India Ageing Report 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA publishes the State of World Population report. UNDESA accurately publishes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report.  The WFP publishes the Global Report on Food Crisis. Only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the publications of key UN organizations, requiring familiarity with their respective mandates and areas of expertise.  The deliberate mismatching of reports and organizations acts as a significant distractor, requiring precise knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                       Headquarters
1. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) :   Geneva, Switzerland
2. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) : Washington, D.C., USA
3. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) : New York, USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only the headquarters of UNHCR is correctly matched.  The IFPRI's headquarters is in Washington, D.C., USA, not Geneva, Switzerland. GANHRI's headquarters is in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York, USA.  The question tests factual recall of the headquarters of these significant international organizations.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly match at least one of the organizations with its headquarters.  Understanding the locations of these organizations is crucial for comprehending their global reach and influence in addressing issues related to food security, refugee protection, and human rights.


**2. With reference to reports on global trends, consider the following pairs:**

Report Title                                      Key Finding
1. ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’ :  Around 108.4 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide in 2022.
2. ‘Global Food Policy Report 2023: Rethinking food crisis responses’ : Food insecurity has risen during 2020-2022 due to multiple crises.
3. ‘Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition’ : India was ranked 127 out of 146 countries in 2023.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only the first two pairs are correctly matched.  The ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’ did indeed find that approximately 108.4 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide in 2022.  The ‘Global Food Policy Report 2023’ accurately reflects the rise in food insecurity during 2020-2022 due to various crises. However, the SDG Progress Report did not include a ranking of India.  The Global Gender Gap Index, a separate report, contained that ranking. This question assesses the ability to recall key findings from specific reports and distinguishes between similar-sounding reports focusing on different global challenges. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair concerning the SDG report or incorrectly exclude the correctly matched pairs about displacement and food insecurity.


**3. With reference to organizations working on social issues, consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                  Mandate/Focus Area
1. UNFPA                                        : Reducing stunting in identified districts of India
2. UNDESA                                      : Achieving three zeros by 2030 (ending unmet need for family planning, preventable maternal deaths, gender-based violence)
3. World Food Programme (WFP)               : Monitoring implementation of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (d). None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The UNFPA's mandate focuses on sexual and reproductive health and rights, not specifically on reducing stunting in India (that falls under other organizations' purview). UNDESA's work is broader, focusing on sustainable development goals, not the UNFPA's "three zeros" goal. The WFP focuses on food security and assistance, not on monitoring the ICPD Programme of Action (that is the function of UNCPD).  This question tests the understanding of the specific mandates and areas of focus of different UN agencies working on global development challenges, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of their respective roles.  Incorrect options show a lack of clarity regarding these organizations' specific responsibilities.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy                                          Key Provision/Objective
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :  Ensuring 5% reservation in government jobs for PwDs
2. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016       :  Banning manual scavenging
3. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021                 :  Allowing only altruistic surrogacy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a). The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, focuses on the rights and protections of PwDs, including provisions related to reservations, not banning manual scavenging (that is under a different act). The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, indeed only allows altruistic surrogacy.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act aims at banning the practice, not providing reservations for PwDs. This question tests the understanding of different Indian laws pertaining to social justice and welfare, requiring accurate knowledge of the specific provisions of each act.  Incorrect options demonstrate a lack of precision in associating the provisions with the correct acts.


**5. With reference to the Indian education system, consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy/Framework                                 Key Feature
1. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020            : Establishment of the National Research Foundation (NRF)
2. National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) :  Introduction of a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling
3. National Credit Framework (NCrF)                  :  Composite Assessment System for higher education institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because NEP 2020 did lead to the establishment of the NRF, and NCF-SE introduced the 5+3+3+4 schooling structure.  The NCrF, however, does not directly relate to a composite assessment system for higher education; that is a feature of a different reform. This question tests the understanding of the key features of various policies and frameworks related to the Indian education system.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair related to the NCrF.  A strong understanding of these educational reforms is crucial for analyzing the direction and evolution of the education sector in India.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Index/Report                                     Key Publisher/Releasing Body
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                     :  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
2. Global Gender Gap Index                       :   United Nations Development Programme
3. Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) : World Economic Forum

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The GHI is indeed published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. However, the Global Gender Gap Index is published by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. The UHC Service Coverage Index is a joint product of the WHO and the World Bank, not the World Economic Forum.  This question tests the ability to connect different indices and reports with their respective publishing or releasing bodies, demonstrating an understanding of data sources and their credibility in the context of development indicators. Incorrect options reflect a misunderstanding of the organizations responsible for these key reports.


**7. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following pairs:**

Program/Initiative                                  Key Feature
1. Saksham Anganwadis                             :  Focuses solely on children aged 0-6 years
2. Poshan Tracker                                  : A job-aid for Anganwadi Workers using smartphones
3. National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan : Aims to improve utilization of key Anganwadi Services to reduce stunting

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The Poshan Tracker is indeed a mobile application used by Anganwadi Workers to monitor nutrition delivery. The POSHAN Abhiyan aims to improve Anganwadi services to reduce stunting.  However, Saksham Anganwadis expand the focus beyond children aged 0-6 years to also include adolescent girls and early childhood care and education.  This question tests knowledge about the Anganwadi system and related government initiatives, demanding precise recall of program features and objectives.  Incorrect options demonstrate a lack of complete understanding of the programs' scope and implementation.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

Tribal Group/Category                                 Characteristic/Status
1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)    :  Always pre-agricultural level of technology
2. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                         :  All are nomadic tribes
3. Hakki Pikki Tribe                                 :  A Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. While PVTGs often exhibit pre-agricultural technology, it's not always the case.  Not all DNTs are nomadic; they are a diverse group. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group, not a PVTG.  This question tests the understanding of the characteristics and categorization of different tribal groups in India, demanding careful consideration of the nuances within each category.  All incorrect options wrongly assume at least one pair to be correctly matched, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of these groups' characteristics.


**9. With reference to the Indian legal framework on social issues, consider the following pairs:**

Legislation                                          Key Element/Provision
1. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 : Allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women
2. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Defines a child as a person below 18 years of age
3. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 :  Mandates the constitution of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The Juvenile Justice Act does define a child as a person below 18. The Sexual Harassment Act mandates the formation of ICCs.  However, the MTP Act does not allow termination up to 24 weeks for all women; there are specific conditions and time limits involved. This question assesses the understanding of key elements within specific Indian legislation dealing with women's health, children's rights, and workplace safety.  Incorrect options reflect an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of the legal provisions of these acts.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tribal Group                      State
1. Bharia PVTG                       :   Chhattisgarh
2. Kamar PVTG                        :   Madhya Pradesh
3. Baiga PVTG                         :   Odisha
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are all listed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). However, the provided pairs incorrectly assign the states.  Bharia and Baiga are PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Kamar is also a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs, but this doesn't mean that all PVTGs are located there. The question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the geographical distribution of these specific tribal groups. Options (a), (b), and (c) present plausible but inaccurate pairings, highlighting the need for precise factual recall.  The correct answer is (d) because none of the individual pairings are entirely accurate regarding the state association of these PVTGs.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

    Criterion for Identifying PVTGs     :    Description
1. Pre-agricultural level of technology :    High level of literacy
2. Low level of literacy                :    Economic advancement
3. Declining or stagnant population   :    High population growth
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the criteria used to identify PVTGs. All three pairs are incorrectly matched.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural level of technology, low levels of literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. The options provide distractors that are the opposite or unrelated to the actual criteria. Option (d) is correct as none of the given pairs accurately reflect the criteria for PVTG identification. This question highlights the importance of precise understanding of definitions and characteristics related to vulnerable groups.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Committee                         Focus Area
1. Swaran Singh Committee           :   Empowering Tribals
2. Gadgil Committee                   :   Protection of Western Ghats
3. Kasturirangan Committee          :   Railway Reforms
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge of various committees and their areas of focus. The Swaran Singh Committee focused on education and constitutional amendments, not tribal empowerment. The Gadgil and Kasturirangan Committees both dealt with the environmental protection of the Western Ghats, but the question uses a distractor by including Railway Reforms in one pair.  Only the Gadgil and Kasturirangan Committees correctly relate to the Western Ghats' protection.  Option (b) is correct because only the pairing of the Gadgil Committee with the protection of the Western Ghats is accurate.  This demonstrates the need for precise knowledge of committee mandates and avoiding generalizations.


**4. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Scheme                          Description
1. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871          :   Repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
2. SEED Scheme                         :   Construction of Hostels for DNTs
3. Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme            :   Provides free competitive exam coaching
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses knowledge about legislation and schemes related to DNTs. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952. However, the SEED scheme focuses on economic empowerment (including competitive exam coaching and health insurance), while the Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme is for constructing hostels. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly pair the schemes with their descriptions. This question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding schemes and accurately recall their objectives.  The correct answer is (a) as only the first pair is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                       Key Feature
1. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Recognizes 21 types of disabilities
2. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016      :   Bans manual scavenging
3. National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem :   Provides for rehabilitation of manual scavengers
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of legislation related to manual scavenging and disability rights. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, focuses on banning manual scavenging and providing rehabilitation. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, deals with disability rights, not manual scavenging.  The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate manual scavenging, but the question uses distractors by mentioning rehabilitation.  Only the first and third pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) present incorrect pairings, emphasizing the importance of precise understanding of the acts and policies.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of NCF-SE                       :    Feature
1. Curriculum Framework                  :    4+3+3+5 structure
2. Board Examinations                   :    Single examination per year
3. Vocational Education                 :    Engagement in three forms of work
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses the candidate's knowledge about the features of the NCF-SE. The NCF-SE uses a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, not 4+3+3+5. Board examinations allow students to take them twice a year, not just once.  Vocational education does indeed propose engagement in three forms of work.  Therefore, only the third pair is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly pair the aspects with their features. This question highlights the need for precise recall of details within the NCF-SE framework.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                         Report/Index
1. World Economic Forum                :    Global Hunger Index
2. Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe :   Global Gender Gap Index
3. UN Women and UNDP                  :    Path to Equal Report
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question evaluates the candidate's knowledge of various organizations and the reports/indices they release. The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index, not the Global Hunger Index. Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe release the Global Hunger Index. UN Women and UNDP jointly prepare the Path to Equal Report.  Therefore, only the third pair is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's familiarity with international organizations and their publications, emphasizing the importance of accurate association.


**8. With reference to the National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

    Funding Source of NRF                :   Description
1. Grants and loans from the central government :  Income from investments
2. Donations to the fund                   :   Funds from the SERB Act, 2008
3. Income from investments of the amounts received by the Foundation :  Grants from private organizations
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question tests the candidate's understanding of the funding mechanisms for the NRF. The NRF receives funding from grants and loans from the central government, donations, income from investments, and amounts from the SERB Act, 2008.  The question uses distractors to create plausible but incorrect pairings. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings. Only the first two pairs accurately represent funding sources for the NRF. This question tests the candidate's ability to correctly identify the sources of funding for a specific organization.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Higher Education Institution Type     :   Governing Body
1. Deemed-to-be Universities           :   UGC
2. Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India :   Ministry of Education
3. National Medical Commission           :  National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1,2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of governing bodies for different types of higher education institutions. Deemed-to-be Universities are governed by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India require approval from the UGC, not the Ministry of Education, although the Ministry plays a role in their overall regulation. The National Medical Commission is an independent regulatory body, not under NCERT. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain inaccurate pairings. Only the first pair is accurately matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the regulatory frameworks for different educational institutions.


**10. With reference to the  National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following pairs:**

    Level in NCrF                    :    Educational Category
1. Levels 1-4                       :    Higher Education
2. Levels 4.5-8                     :    Vocational Education & Training
3. National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) :    School Education
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question tests the candidate's understanding of the levels and integration within the NCrF. Levels 1-4 in the NCrF refer to school education, not higher education. Levels 4.5-8 are for higher education, not vocational education.  The NHEQF is specifically for higher education, not school education.  Only the second pair is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's ability to grasp the structure and components of the NCrF, highlighting the importance of precise understanding of the framework.  The other options provide plausible but inaccurate pairings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Headquarters
1. UNFPA                                          :   Geneva, Switzerland
2. UNDESA                                         :   New York, USA
3. UN Commission on Population and Development :   Rome, Italy
4. World Food Programme                         :   New York, USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of UNDESA with New York, USA is correct.  The UNFPA's headquarters are in New York, USA, not Geneva, Switzerland. The UN Commission on Population and Development is also headquartered in New York, USA, not Rome, Italy.  The World Food Programme is based in Rome, Italy, not New York, USA. This question tests factual recall of the headquarters of these important UN organizations.  The incorrect options include plausible distractors, as all organizations mentioned are indeed associated with the UN and located in major global cities.  Understanding the correct headquarters is crucial for comprehending the organizational structure and global reach of these significant bodies.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to accurately recall specific factual details.


**2. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Feature                                    Target Year
1. Achieving 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio in Higher Education :   2025
2. Implementation of the 5+3+3+4 curricular structure   :   2030
3. Completion of transition to the proposed accreditation regime for HEIs :  2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The NEP 2020 aims for a 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education by 2035, not 2025. The implementation of the 5+3+3+4 curricular structure is a phased process, and while it began after 2020, it's not fully implemented by a specific year like 2030. The transition to the new accreditation regime for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) was targeted for completion by December 2023, as per the recommendations of the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the NEP 2020's timeline and implementation strategy. The incorrect options present plausible but inaccurate timelines related to key policy goals, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between the actual implementation schedule and potentially perceived or anticipated timelines.  The question demands precise factual recall and understanding of the phased rollout of major educational reforms.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                    Releasing Organization
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                      :   Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
2. Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report :   World Bank
3. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress Report 2023 :   Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), India
4. India Ageing Report 2023                        :    International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct pairings are 1, 3, and 4. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress Report 2023 was released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) in India. The India Ageing Report 2023 was released in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS). However, the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" was released by the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), not the World Bank. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various reports and indices related to global development, social issues, and demographic trends, testing their recall of the organizations responsible for their publication.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, using organizations involved in related fields, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the releasing bodies.  The question emphasizes factual recall and the ability to correctly associate reports with their respective publishers.


**4. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                                     Key Feature
1. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0                 :   Focuses solely on children aged 0-6 years
2. Poshan Tracker                                      :   A mobile application for tracking nutrition service delivery
3. National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children    :   Emphasizes a medical model of disability care
4. Intensified Mission Indradhanush                    :   Part of the Anganwadi Services Scheme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched.  Poshan Tracker is indeed a mobile application used for tracking nutrition service delivery within the Anganwadi system.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 expand the Anganwadi's scope beyond just children aged 0-6 years, including adolescent girls and early childhood care and education. The National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children emphasizes a social model of inclusive care, not a medical model.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush is a separate immunization program, not directly part of the Anganwadi Services Scheme. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Anganwadi system's various components and associated initiatives, requiring precise knowledge of specific programs and their features.  The incorrect options contain plausible but inaccurate descriptions of the programs, highlighting the need for detailed knowledge of the system's functionalities and goals. The question assesses the candidate's ability to accurately recall and differentiate between various initiatives within the Anganwadi framework.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                       Key Provision
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021                  :   Allows commercial surrogacy
2. Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 :   Regulates ART clinics and banks
3. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 :   Allows manual scavenging under certain conditions
4.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013  :   Mandates the constitution of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in all workplaces


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, does regulate ART clinics and banks. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, mandates the constitution of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs). However, the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, specifically prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to completely eradicate manual scavenging, not allow it under any conditions. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various acts and regulations related to social issues and their key provisions.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options, such as allowing commercial surrogacy or manual scavenging under conditions, tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of these laws.  The question emphasizes the need for precise knowledge of legal provisions and their implications.
