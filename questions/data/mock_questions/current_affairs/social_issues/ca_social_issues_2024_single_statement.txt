**1.  Which initiative aims to create a fully integrated, instantly accessible, and seamless information network for all information related to schools across India?**

(a)  National Means cum Merit Scholarship Scheme
(b)  Pradhan Mantri YUVA (Young, Upcoming and Versatile Authors) 2.0 Scheme
(c)  Integrated National School Education Treasury (INSET)
(d)  Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Integrated National School Education Treasury (INSET) is explicitly designed to create a comprehensive and easily accessible information network for schools across India.  It envisions a multi-layered ecosystem of information, ranging from school-wise data to regional summaries. This contrasts with the other options. The National Means cum Merit Scholarship Scheme focuses on financial aid for students, Pradhan Mantri YUVA is an author mentorship program, and Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat targets language and mathematics development in schools, none of which directly address the creation of a nationwide school information network.  The INSET's goal of seamless information accessibility aligns directly with the question's description of a fully integrated and accessible system.  Understanding the specific mandate of each scheme is crucial for answering this question correctly.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of government educational initiatives.


**2.  Which program integrates current interest subsidy and guarantee fund contribution schemes and scholarships for higher education?**

(a)  National Educational Alliance for Technology (NEAT)
(b)  PM Uchchatar Shiksha Protsahan (PM-USP) Yojana
(c)  Education Quality Upgradation and Inclusion Programme (EQUIP)
(d)  Scheme for Trans-disciplinary Research for India’s Developing Economy (STRIDE)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PM Uchchatar Shiksha Protsahan (PM-USP) Yojana is specifically described as integrating existing interest subsidy, guarantee fund contributions, and scholarships for higher education. This directly addresses the question's prompt.  The other options, while related to education, do not encompass this specific integration of financial aid mechanisms. NEAT focuses on technology in education, EQUIP on broader quality and inclusion, and STRIDE on research funding.  The correct answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the specific aims and functions of various government schemes related to higher education.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding programs.


**3. Which scheme aims to address the low enrolment of girl students in prestigious engineering institutions and the teaching gap between school education and engineering entrance examinations?**

(a)  Rashtriya Ekta Shivirs
(b)  Digital Gender Atlas for Advancing Girl’s Education in India
(c)  Udaan: Giving wings to girls

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "Udaan: Giving wings to girls" program directly targets the low enrolment of girls in engineering institutions and the existing gap in bridging school education with engineering entrance exam preparation.  The program provides free resources to address this specific challenge.  The other options address different aspects of education. Rashtriya Ekta Shivirs focus on national integration, the Digital Gender Atlas provides data analysis on gender disparities in education, and the Shala Gunvatta portal is a repository of best practices. These programs do not directly address the specific issues highlighted in the question.  The question tests the ability to connect a program's objectives with its specific goals, requiring detailed knowledge of government educational initiatives.


**4. Which program uses a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model between the Government and educational technology companies in India?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Innovation Learning Programme (DHRUV)
(b)  National Educational Alliance for Technology (NEAT)
(c)  Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQUIP)
(d)  EK Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Programme


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Educational Alliance for Technology (NEAT) explicitly utilizes a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, involving collaboration between the government and private educational technology companies.  This is a key feature differentiating it from other schemes.  The Pradhan Mantri Innovation Learning Programme (DHRUV) focuses on identifying and nurturing talented children, the Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQUIP) aims to improve technical education quality, and EK Bharat Shreshtha Bharat focuses on cultural exchange between states.  The question assesses understanding of the different models used by government schemes and requires detailed knowledge of specific programs.


**5. Which scheme aims to identify and encourage talented children to enrich their skills and knowledge by providing mentorship from renowned experts?**

(a)  Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat
(b)  Scheme for Trans-disciplinary Research for India’s Developing Economy (STRIDE)
(c)  Pradhan Mantri Innovation Learning Programme (DHRUV)
(d)  Integrated National School Education Treasury (INSET)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Pradhan Mantri Innovation Learning Programme (DHRUV) directly focuses on identifying talented children and providing them with mentorship from experts in various fields to help them reach their full potential.  The other options have different objectives. Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat aims to improve language and math skills, STRIDE supports research in humanities and human sciences, and INSET creates an information network for schools.  These do not align with the question's focus on identifying and nurturing talented children through expert mentorship.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to understand the nuanced differences between various government programs targeting different aspects of education.


**6. Which initiative aims to celebrate cultural diversity through mutual interaction and reciprocity between people of different states and union territories in India?**

(a)  EK Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Programme
(b)  Udaan: Giving wings to girls
(c)  Digital Gender Atlas for Advancing Girl’s Education in India
(d)  Shala Gunvatta (Shagun) Portal


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The EK Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Programme is explicitly designed to foster cultural exchange and interaction between different states and union territories in India.  The program promotes mutual understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures.  The other options are focused on other aspects such as empowering girls in education (Udaan, Digital Gender Atlas) or providing a repository of educational best practices (Shala Gunvatta).  These initiatives do not directly address the promotion of cultural diversity through reciprocal interaction between different regions.  The question tests the ability to connect a program's name with its specific objectives, requiring knowledge of government initiatives promoting national integration and cultural understanding.


**7.  Which program aims to improve the quality of the technical education system in India, with a special focus on low-income and special category states?**

(a)  National Educational Alliance for Technology (NEAT)
(b)  Education Quality Upgradation and Inclusion Programme (EQUIP)
(c)  Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQUIP)
(d)  Pradhan Mantri YUVA (Young, Upcoming and Versatile Authors) 2.0 Scheme


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQUIP) explicitly aims to enhance the quality of technical education, particularly in low-income and special category states.  This is a core objective of the program.  The other options address different aspects of education, such as technology integration (NEAT), overall quality and inclusion (EQUIP), or author mentorship (PM YUVA).  These do not directly target the improvement of technical education in specific regions.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between educational initiatives with similar names but differing objectives.  It also requires understanding of the geographical focus of specific programs.


**8. Which scheme provides a credit shield for education loans offered by regional rural banks (RRBs)?**

(a)  Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for Education Loans (CGFSEL)
(b)  Integrated National School Education Treasury (INSET)
(c)  Pradhan Mantri Innovation Learning Programme (DHRUV)
(d)  National Educational Alliance for Technology (NEAT)


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for Education Loans (CGFSEL) specifically extends its guarantee coverage to education loans provided by regional rural banks (RRBs), aiming to make these loans more accessible. The other options are unrelated to education loan guarantees. INSET is a school information network, DHRUV is a talent identification program, and NEAT promotes technology in education.  The question tests factual recall and requires precise knowledge of the specific functions of government financial aid schemes related to education.  Understanding the role of different government agencies in providing financial support for education is crucial.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding,  with explanations exceeding 100 words each.  The questions are designed to be challenging and avoid trivial answers.


**1.  Consider the following statements regarding the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 2021, in India:**

I.  Termination of pregnancy is allowed up to 24 weeks for all women based on the advice of two doctors.
II.  The Act includes provisions for termination beyond 24 weeks only on grounds of fetal abnormalities.
III. The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling extended the right to safe and legal abortion up to 24 weeks to unmarried and single women.

Which of the statements above is/are correct?

(a) I and II only
(b) II and III only
(c) I and III only
(d) II only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement I is incorrect because while termination up to 20 weeks is available to all women based on one doctor's advice, access from 20 to 24 weeks is restricted to specific categories of women (rape survivors, those facing marital status changes during pregnancy, etc.) and requires the advice of two doctors.  The Act does not provide universal access up to 24 weeks. Statement II is correct; the MTP Act explicitly allows termination beyond 24 weeks only under the exceptional circumstances of detected fetal abnormalities, requiring a medical board's recommendation. This reflects a balance between a woman's reproductive rights and the protection of fetal life.  Statement III is also correct. The Supreme Court's 2022 decision significantly broadened access to abortion by explicitly including unmarried and single women under the purview of the MTP Act, addressing a previously existing gap in legal protection. Therefore, only statements II and III are accurate.


**2.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, in India encompasses several key features. Which of the following is NOT a provision under the PWDVA, 2005?**

(a)  Provision for shelter homes or medical facilities for victims.
(b)  Criminal prosecution for marital rape.
(c)  Defining domestic violence to include physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and/or sexual abuse.
(d)  The right to file a complaint against relatives of the husband or male partner.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, is a significant piece of legislation aimed at protecting women from various forms of domestic violence. Option (a) is accurate as the act explicitly provides for the provision of shelter and medical aid to victims. Option (c) correctly reflects the Act's broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing a range of abusive behaviors.  Option (d) is also true; the Act allows complaints to be filed against a wide array of individuals involved in a domestic relationship, including the husband's relatives. However, option (b) is incorrect.  A crucial limitation of the PWDVA is that it only provides for civil remedies for marital rape; it does not allow for criminal proceedings against the perpetrator. This limitation has been a subject of ongoing debate and calls for legal reform.  The absence of criminal sanctions for marital rape within the PWDVA is a significant gap in the legal protection afforded to women.


**3.  The Boeing Sukanya Program, recently launched in India, aims to address which of the following primary objectives?**

(a) To promote gender equality in the field of medicine and healthcare.
(b) To increase the representation of women in STEM fields, particularly within the aviation sector.
(c) To provide scholarships for women pursuing higher education in engineering and technology.
(d) To enhance the skills of women in traditional crafts and rural industries.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Boeing Sukanya Program is a targeted initiative designed to encourage greater participation of girls and women in India's aviation sector.  Option (a) is incorrect, as the program is not primarily focused on healthcare but rather on aviation and related STEM fields. Option (c) is partially correct in that it does involve scholarships, but the program’s scope is broader than just higher education in engineering and technology; it also encompasses skill development and training for aviation-specific jobs. Option (d) is completely unrelated to the program's goals, which are centered on the aviation industry and modern STEM fields. Option (b) is the most accurate description; the program's core objective is to support the entry of girls and women into the aviation sector by providing them with opportunities to learn critical STEM skills and pursue careers in this field. This directly addresses the underrepresentation of women in aviation and related STEM sectors.


**4. Which of the following Acts or initiatives is NOT directly related to addressing violence against women in India?**

(a)  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act).
(b)  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA).
(c)  The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY).
(d)  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act and PWDVA are both directly concerned with preventing and addressing various forms of violence against women in India. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, while a broader criminal code, includes provisions related to domestic violence and other offenses impacting women. However, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a rural infrastructure development program aimed at providing all-weather road connectivity in rural areas. While improved infrastructure can indirectly benefit women by improving access to services and opportunities, it is not directly focused on addressing violence against them.  Therefore, PMGSY is the only option not directly related to combating violence against women.  The other options are all legislative or policy instruments specifically designed to address different aspects of violence against women, either in the workplace, the home, or through broader criminal justice reform.


**5. The  "Prayatna" project, highlighted in a NITI Aayog report, focuses on which of the following target groups?**

(a)  Marginalized farmers in rural areas.
(b)  Children from underprivileged backgrounds.
(c)  Transgender individuals in the Delhi-NCR region.
(d)  Women entrepreneurs seeking microfinance assistance.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prayatna project is specifically designed to provide livelihood and enterprise training to transgender individuals.  Option (a) is incorrect; while there are other initiatives targeting marginalized farmers, Prayatna's focus is explicitly on the transgender community. Option (b) is also incorrect; the project does not primarily target children. Option (d) is similarly incorrect; although many programs support women entrepreneurs, Prayatna's target group is the transgender population. Option (c) accurately identifies the target beneficiaries of the Prayatna project: transgender people in the Delhi-NCR region. This initiative exemplifies a targeted approach to skill development and economic empowerment within a specific vulnerable population group.  The project's inclusion in the NITI Aayog report further underscores its importance as a best practice in social sector initiatives.

(c)  Pre-agricultural level of technology, low literacy rates, and economic backwardness.
(d)  Modern agricultural techniques, significant economic growth, and a rapidly growing population.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  PVTGs are identified based on their relatively low level of socio-economic development. This includes their reliance on pre-agricultural technologies, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and often, a stagnant or declining population. Options (a), (b), and (d) present contradictory characteristics to the actual criteria for PVTG identification.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the specific criteria used for classifying vulnerable groups.  The ability to differentiate between characteristics of developed and underdeveloped communities is key to understanding societal challenges and government interventions.

(c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(d) The Right to Education Act, 2009

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly prohibits the practice of manual scavenging and mandates the rehabilitation of those engaged in it.  The other options deal with different aspects of social justice and human rights but do not directly address the specific issue of manual scavenging. This question tests factual recall of legislation related to social justice and human rights.  The ability to connect specific laws with their intended social impact is important for understanding policy implementation and its effectiveness.

This crucial step is necessary for better targeting of welfare schemes and effective policy implementation. While the commission's work indirectly contributes to the other areas, its primary function is the creation of this crucial database.  This question tests conceptual understanding of the role of governmental commissions and their specific functions within the broader context of social welfare.  The ability to discern the primary function from secondary effects is a critical skill for UPSC aspirants.

(a)  National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM)
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)
(c)  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(d)  National Food Security Act (NFSA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is specifically designed to address the economic needs of DNTs.  While the other options focus on broader aspects of poverty alleviation and social welfare, SEED is specifically targeted toward the economic upliftment of DNT communities.  This question tests factual recall of specific government schemes and their target beneficiaries.  Understanding the nuances of different social welfare programs is essential for answering policy-related questions in the UPSC exam.


**6.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation of ______% in government jobs for persons with disabilities.**

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, is the primary legislation that directly addresses the issue of manual scavenging.  The other acts, while relevant to broader social justice issues, do not specifically target the practice of manual scavenging. This question tests factual recall of relevant legislation and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding acts.  A strong understanding of social justice legislation is crucial for UPSC success.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.


**1.  A national-level initiative aimed at improving the nutritional status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, while also seeking to reduce mortality and morbidity rates related to malnutrition, is best described as:**

(a)  The National Family Health Survey
(b)  The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme

It uses Anganwadi Centers as its primary delivery mechanism, providing supplementary nutrition, immunization, health check-ups, and early childhood care and education.  While the other options address health and well-being, they are not primarily focused on the nutritional and health needs of this specific demographic group at the scale and scope of the ICDS. The National Family Health Survey collects data, Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on health insurance and access to healthcare, and Mission Indradhanush targets immunization.


**2. The 2023 report, which analyzed the global impact of unsafe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services and highlighted their contribution to preventable deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), was published by:**

(a)  UNICEF
(b)  The World Bank
(c)  The World Health Organization (WHO)
(d)  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The World Health Organization (WHO) is the primary United Nations agency responsible for global health issues.  Their report on the burden of disease attributable to unsafe WASH services directly aligns with their mandate and expertise in public health. While UNICEF and UNDP also work on WASH-related issues, and the World Bank might be involved in financing related projects, the specific report mentioned was authored by WHO.


**3.  Which organization is responsible for overseeing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) globally, based on the Paris Principles, and recently deferred the accreditation of India's National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)?**

(a)  The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)
(b)  The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(c)  Amnesty International
(d)  Human Rights Watch


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is the international body tasked with assessing and accrediting NHRIs based on internationally recognized standards, the Paris Principles.  The UNHRC is a UN body that deals with human rights at a global level, but it does not directly accredit national institutions. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are prominent NGOs working on human rights issues but do not have the formal role of accrediting national institutions.


**4. Which of the following initiatives aims to seamlessly integrate credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education, thereby promoting flexibility and mobility within the Indian education system?**

(a)  The National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(b)  The National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(c)  The National Credit Framework (NCrF)
(d)  The Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is a meta-framework designed to unify and integrate credits earned across various educational pathways in India.  While NHEQF and NSQF are frameworks for higher education and skills respectively, and ABC is a digital platform for storing credits, the NCrF is the overarching structure that facilitates the integration of these different credit systems.


**5.  Which government ministry is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India, including the identification and support of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b)  Ministry of Rural Development
(c)  Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d)  Ministry of Home Affairs


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is specifically mandated to address the needs and welfare of Scheduled Tribes in India.  This includes formulating and implementing policies for their development, protection of their rights, and addressing the unique challenges faced by PVTGs. While other ministries may have overlapping responsibilities in certain areas, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs holds the primary responsibility for overall tribal welfare.


**6.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI), a tool used to assess the performance of school education systems at the state and district levels in India, relies primarily on data from which two key sources?**

(a)  The National Sample Survey (NSS) and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)
(b)  The Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS)
(c)  The District Information System for Education (DISE) and the National Education Policy (NEP)
(d)  The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PGI uses data from the UDISE+ and NAS to provide a comprehensive assessment of school education performance. UDISE+ offers administrative data on schools, while NAS provides data on student learning outcomes.  The other options include other important sources of information on education but are not the primary sources for PGI.

(a)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act
(b)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(c)  The Right to Education Act
(d)  The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, specifically targets the practice of manual scavenging and provides a legal framework for its elimination. It also includes provisions for the rehabilitation and social inclusion of those engaged in this hazardous occupation. The other acts address different social issues, but not specifically manual scavenging and its rehabilitation.


**8. Which of the following acts seeks to regulate and supervise Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) clinics and banks in India, aiming to prevent misuse and ensure safe and ethical practices?**

(a) Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
(b) Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971
(c) Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021
(d) Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, specifically addresses the regulation of ART clinics and banks. This includes provisions for licensing, ethical guidelines, and the prevention of exploitation.  The other acts deal with surrogacy, abortion, and juvenile justice, respectively.


**9. The institution that was recently granted Deemed-to-be-University status, allowing it to offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees and granting it greater autonomy in curriculum design, examinations, and management, is:**

(a)  The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs)
(b)  The Indian Institute of Science (IISc)
(c)  The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
(d)  The University Grants Commission (UGC)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) recently received Deemed-to-be-University status.  This significantly enhances its ability to shape educational programs and research at various levels. The other institutions are already established universities or bodies overseeing higher education.


**10. Which of the following international organizations released the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022" report, highlighting the rising number of forcibly displaced people worldwide due to conflict, violence, and persecution?**

(a)  The International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b)  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  The World Bank
(d)  The International Labour Organization (ILO)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNHCR is the lead UN agency responsible for protecting refugees and displaced persons globally.  Their annual "Global Trends" report provides comprehensive data and analysis on forced displacement.  The other organizations deal with migration, development, and labor issues, respectively, but not specifically with the global overview of forced displacement.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in education and related areas.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills, with detailed explanations provided.


**1.  A government initiative aims to improve the research capacity of Indian Universities and mitigate gender disparity in science and engineering research funding.  Which program best fits this description?**

(a)  IMPRINT India
(b)  PURSE
(c)  FIST Scheme
(d)  SERB-POWER

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The Promotion of University Research and Scientific Excellence (PURSE) program is explicitly designed to strengthen the research capacity of Indian universities.  Furthermore, SERB-POWER (Promoting Opportunities for Women in Exploratory Research) directly addresses the gender disparity aspect by focusing on providing research funding opportunities specifically for women in science and engineering. While IMPRINT India and the FIST Scheme support research and infrastructure, they don't have the specific dual focus of university research capacity building and gender equity that PURSE and SERB-POWER offer.  Therefore, PURSE is the most accurate answer.


**2.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) integrates credits earned through various educational pathways. Which three qualification frameworks are primarily encompassed by the NCrF?**

(a)  National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), National Curriculum Framework (NCF), and the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS)
(b)  National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and the National Vocational Training Scheme (NVTS)
(c)  National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and the National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF)
(d)  National Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education (NCFTE), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and the National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF explicitly aims to integrate credits from school education, higher education, and vocational/skill education.  Option (c) correctly identifies the three frameworks that represent these three sectors: NHEQF for higher education, NSQF for vocational and skill education, and NSEQF for school education. The other options include irrelevant or partially relevant frameworks, failing to accurately reflect the comprehensive nature of NCrF's integration efforts.


**3.  A government report categorizes states and districts into ten grades based on school education performance. Which report uses this grading system, and what data sources underpin its assessment?**

(a)  National Achievement Survey (NAS) Report, using data from the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)
(b)  Performance Grading Index (PGI) Report, using data from UDISE+ and NAS
(c)  District Information System for Education (DISE) Report, using data from school self-reports
(d)  National Education Policy (NEP) Implementation Report, using data from various sources including PGI

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Performance Grading Index (PGI) report explicitly uses a ten-grade system to classify states and districts based on their school education performance.  The report draws upon data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS).  The other options either use different reporting mechanisms or data sources, making them inaccurate.


**4. The  National Medical Commission (NMC) recently received a significant accreditation. Which organization granted this accreditation, and what is a key benefit of this recognition for existing medical colleges in India?**

(a)  The World Health Organization (WHO) granted accreditation; all medical colleges will receive increased funding.
(b)  The World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) granted accreditation; all existing medical colleges will become WFME accredited.
(c)  The Medical Council of India (MCI) granted accreditation; all medical colleges will have their licensing automatically renewed.
(d)  The National Board of Examinations (NBE) granted accreditation; all existing medical colleges will be exempted from periodic inspections.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) granted recognition to the NMC, a crucial step for the accreditation of medical colleges in India. A direct consequence of this recognition is that all 706 existing medical colleges automatically receive WFME accreditation, enhancing their international standing and credibility. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they attribute the accreditation to the wrong organizations and list incorrect benefits.


**5.  A recent Supreme Court judgment emphasized the importance of identifying children in childcare institutions who haven't been visited by their parents for over a year or have "unfit" parents. Which case is this referring to, and what is the key directive resulting from the judgment?**

(a)  Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan, directing the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees.
(b)  Shayara Bano v. Union of India, challenging the constitutional validity of Triple Talaq.
(c)  Temple of Healing v. Union of India, directing states to identify children for adoption.
(d)  Puttaswamy v. Union of India, upholding the right to privacy.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court's judgment in *Temple of Healing v. Union of India* specifically addresses the need to identify children in childcare institutions who meet certain criteria (lack of parental visits, unfit parents/guardians) and bring them into the adoption pool.  The judgment directs states and union territories to proactively identify such children and initiate adoption procedures.  The other options refer to unrelated cases and legal issues.


**6.  A report highlights the rise in food insecurity due to multiple crises, including climate change and conflict. Which organization published this report, and what is one of its key projections regarding undernourishment?**

(a)  The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) projected a decrease in global undernourishment.
(b)  The World Food Programme (WFP) projected a significant increase in global hunger due to conflict.
(c)  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) projected that climate change will exacerbate undernourishment.
(d)  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) projected a stable level of global undernourishment.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) released the report "Global Food Policy Report 2023," which focuses on the increasing food insecurity.  A key finding of this report is that climate change will lead to a substantial increase in the number of undernourished people by 2050.  While the other organizations also work on food security issues, their reports did not focus on this specific projection related to climate change and undernourishment.


**7.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for a new structure of schooling. What is this new structure, and what is one of its key features regarding language proficiency?**

(a)  A 10+2 structure; students must be proficient in at least two Indian languages.
(b)  A 5+3+3+4 structure; students should be proficient in at least three languages, with at least two Indian languages.
(c)  A 6+3+3+4 structure; students must be fluent in English and one other Indian language.
(d)  A 4+4+4 structure; students are encouraged to learn as many languages as possible.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, a major departure from the traditional system.  A crucial aspect of this framework is its emphasis on multilingualism, aiming to ensure that all students are proficient in at least three languages, with a minimum of two being Indian languages.  Options (a), (c), and (d) present inaccurate schooling structures or language proficiency requirements.


**8.  A policy aims to ensure that all people have access to a full range of quality health services without financial hardship. What is the name of this policy goal, and what are its three key dimensions?**

(a)  National Health Policy 2017; affordability, accessibility, and equity.
(b)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana; coverage, affordability, and quality.
(c)  Universal Health Coverage (UHC); accessibility, affordability, and quality.
(d)  Mission Indradhanush; immunization, accessibility, and affordability.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is the policy goal that aims to provide everyone with access to quality health services without causing financial hardship. Its three key dimensions are accessibility (the ease of obtaining services), affordability (the cost of services), and quality (the standard of services provided).  The other options either refer to specific programs or list inaccurate dimensions.


**9.  Which organization issued guidance on children's right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment for the first time?**

(a)  UNICEF
(b)  UNESCO
(c)  UNCRC
(d)  WHO

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) issued this guidance, marking a significant development in the understanding and protection of children's environmental rights.  While the other organizations are involved in children's welfare and environmental issues, the UNCRC was the first to specifically address the link between children's rights and environmental sustainability.


**10.  A specific type of village has sustained its Open Defecation Free (ODF) status and implemented both solid and liquid waste management systems, along with maintaining visual cleanliness. What is this type of village called, and what additional feature distinguishes it?**

(a)  ODF+ village; it has a dedicated waste management facility.
(b)  ODF++ village; it has a higher level of sanitation infrastructure.
(c)  ODF Model village; it has a higher percentage of households using toilets.
(d)  ODF Plus Model village; it displays ODF Plus Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) messages.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The description perfectly matches the definition of an ODF Plus Model village.  It goes beyond basic ODF+ status by including visual cleanliness and the display of IEC messages, showcasing a comprehensive approach to sanitation and hygiene. The other options either lack key elements of the definition or use incorrect terminology.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues related to vulnerable groups in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.


**1.  The  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently emphasized the need for implementing a specific commission's report that recommended establishing a permanent body to address the concerns of a particular group of marginalized communities in India.  Which commission's report is the NHRC referring to?**

(a)  The Dhebar Commission Report
(b)  The Renke Commission Report
(c)  The Idate Commission Report
(d)  The Kelkar Committee Report

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the NHRC's recent emphasis on implementing a specific commission's report concerning De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs).  The Idate Commission Report directly addresses this, recommending the establishment of a permanent commission for DNTs. The Dhebar Commission focused on Scheduled Tribes, the Renke Commission on nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes generally, and the Kelkar Committee dealt with tax reforms.  Thus, only the Idate Commission directly addresses the NHRC's concern.


**2. A certain tribal group in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh received habitat rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.  This recognition highlights the government's efforts toward protecting the rights of particularly vulnerable groups.  Which of the following tribal groups received this recognition?**

(a) Great Andamanese
(b) Bharia
(c) Onges
(d) Sentinelese

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question centers on a specific tribal group granted habitat rights, emphasizing the government's focus on particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs). The text explicitly mentions the Bharia PVTG in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh receiving such rights. The other options, while PVTGs, were not specifically cited in this context.  This highlights the importance of understanding the specific implementation of government policies concerning PVTGs.


**3.  Several government initiatives aim to improve the welfare of De-Notified Tribes (DNTs).  One such initiative provides free competitive exam coaching and health insurance. Which of the following schemes is primarily focused on the economic empowerment of DNT communities?**

(a) Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship
(b) Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme
(c) Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(d) National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on a specific government scheme designed for the economic upliftment of DNTs. The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) directly addresses this by offering competitive exam coaching and health insurance. The other options, while contributing to DNT welfare, do not have the primary focus on economic empowerment. The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship focuses on education, the Nanaji Deshmukh scheme on hostels, and the NCDNT is a commission, not a direct empowerment scheme.


**4. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates certain accessibility requirements for government offices.  A recent landmark judgment emphasizes the importance of these requirements.  What key accessibility measure did the court emphasize in its ruling concerning government offices?**

(a)  Providing ramps and elevators in all government buildings.
(b)  Relocating services to accessible locations within the same facility or to the ground floor.
(c)  Equipping all government offices with assistive technologies for PwDs.
(d)  Providing sign language interpreters in all government offices.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on a specific court ruling related to the RPwD Act and accessibility for government offices. The judgment emphasized the relocation of services to accessible locations, either on the ground floor or within the same building, to ensure that PwDs can easily access services.  While other options are also important aspects of accessibility, the court's ruling specifically highlighted this measure as a crucial step in fulfilling the RPwD Act's mandates.


**5.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) aims to eliminate manual scavenging.  Which of the following is NOT a key measure employed by this act to prevent manual scavenging?**

(a)  Demolishing insanitary latrines and converting them into sanitary ones.
(b)  Providing financial assistance and alternative employment training for manual scavengers.
(c)  Setting interest rates for loans extended by commercial banks.
(d)  Mandating local authorities to build and maintain community sanitary latrines.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question tests knowledge of the PEMSR Act and its strategies to eradicate manual scavenging. The act focuses on sanitation infrastructure improvements, rehabilitation of manual scavengers, and enforcement against employing manual scavengers.  Setting interest rates for bank loans is outside the scope of this specific legislation.  The other options are all integral parts of the PEMSR Act's approach.


**6.  The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) launched a national protocol to support children with disabilities within a specific existing social welfare program.  Which program is this protocol integrated with?**

(a)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b)  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
(c)  National Health Mission
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** This question probes the integration of a new disability support protocol within an existing MoWCD program. The national Anganwadi protocol is directly integrated with the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme, leveraging existing Anganwadi Centers and workers to identify and support children with disabilities. The other options are related to health but do not have the same direct connection to the Anganwadi system and child welfare.


**7.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) considers multiple indicators to assess hunger levels. Which of the following is NOT a primary indicator used in the GHI calculation?**

(a) Undernourishment
(b) Child Stunting
(c)  Adult Literacy Rate
(d) Child Wasting


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question tests knowledge of the GHI’s composition. The GHI primarily focuses on nutritional deficiencies and child mortality related to hunger.  Adult literacy, while important for societal development, is not a direct measure of hunger.  Undernourishment, child stunting, and child wasting are all key indicators of the prevalence and severity of hunger.



**8. The  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) plays a significant role in advocating for indigenous rights globally. What is the primary function of the UNPFII?**

(a)  To implement indigenous-led development projects worldwide.
(b)  To provide financial aid to indigenous communities.
(c) To advise the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on indigenous issues.
(d) To enforce international law related to indigenous rights.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question assesses understanding of the UNPFII's role.  The UNPFII serves as a high-level advisory body to the ECOSOC, providing expert recommendations on indigenous issues.  While it may indirectly influence development projects and raise awareness, its core mandate is advisory to the ECOSOC.  It does not directly implement projects, provide financial aid, or enforce international law.


**9.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) proposes a new structure for schooling in India.  Which of the following best describes the proposed structure?**

(a) 4+4+4 system
(b) 5+3+3+4 system
(c) 6+3+3+3 system
(d) 5+4+3+4 system

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** This question directly tests knowledge of the NCF-SE's proposed schooling structure.  The NCF-SE advocates for a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure, aligning with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.  The other options are not consistent with the proposed framework.


**10.  A recent report highlighted the challenges in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Which organization released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023?**

(a) World Bank
(b) International Monetary Fund (IMF)
(c) United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(d)  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  This question tests knowledge of the source of a key report on SDG progress. The UNDESA is responsible for releasing the SDG Progress Report 2023. The other organizations, while involved in development issues, are not the primary source of this specific report.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues related to education and related fields.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring in-depth knowledge and careful analysis.


**1.  Which organization released a report highlighting the weak progress on more than 50% of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets, with progress on 30% having stalled or reversed?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(c) United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(d) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition, which detailed the concerning lack of progress on numerous SDG targets.  The report specifically highlighted that more than half of the targets showed weak progress, while a significant portion had stalled or even regressed.  The other options are incorrect because they are involved in different areas of social development, not specifically the comprehensive SDG progress report. WFP focuses on food security, IFPRI on food policy research, and UNFPA on population issues.  Understanding the mandates of these organizations is crucial for a correct answer, highlighting the need for conceptual understanding of international organizations working on development goals.



**2.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate credits earned through which three primary educational pathways?**

(a) Higher Education, Vocational Education, and Online Learning
(b) School Education, Higher Education, and Distance Learning
(c) School Education, Higher Education, and Vocational & Skill Education
(d) Early Childhood Education, Higher Education, and Apprenticeship Programs

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF's core objective is to create a unified system for accumulating and transferring credits earned across diverse educational streams. These streams explicitly include school education (laying the foundational base), higher education (building upon the foundation), and vocational & skill education (providing practical expertise). Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because, while they may contain elements of learning, they don't encompass the holistic integration of school, higher education, and vocational skills that NCrF prioritizes. This question assesses the conceptual understanding of the NCrF's design and its aim to provide flexibility in education pathways.



**3. Which institution was granted Deemed-to-be-University (DtbU) status, enabling it to offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees and granting it greater autonomy in program development and management?**

(a) Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore
(b) All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)
(c) National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
(d) University Grants Commission (UGC)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) recently received DtbU status. This significantly expands its capabilities, allowing it to independently offer higher education degrees and manage its academic affairs. The other options are incorrect.  IISc Bangalore is already a prestigious institution, AICTE is a regulatory body, and UGC is the overall higher education regulator—none of these needed DtbU status for the specified functions. This question tests factual recall of recent developments in higher education governance and the implications of DtbU status.



**4. According to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) 2.0, which of the following statements about the performance of States/UTs in the 2021-22 school education system is accurate?**

(a) Several States/UTs achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").
(b) Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram achieved the highest grade.
(c) Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade.
(d) No States/UTs achieved the highest grade ("Daksh"), and Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the second-highest grade.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The PGI 2.0 report clearly indicated that no State/UT attained the highest grade ("Daksh").  However, Punjab and Chandigarh reached the second-highest grade ("Prachesta-2"). Options (a), (b), and (c) misrepresent the findings of the PGI 2.0 report. This question tests factual recall of specific data from a recent educational performance assessment.



**5. Which of the following correctly describes the "ODF Plus Model Village" designation under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)?**

(a) A village that has maintained its ODF status for at least 5 years.
(b) A village that has sustained ODF status and implemented solid waste management but not liquid waste management.
(c) A village that has sustained its ODF status and implemented either solid or liquid waste management.
(d) A village that has sustained ODF status, manages both solid and liquid waste, maintains visual cleanliness, and displays IEC messages.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The ODF Plus Model Village criteria are quite specific. It requires not only sustained ODF status and the implementation of both solid and liquid waste management systems but also the maintenance of visual cleanliness and the display of IEC (Information, Education, and Communication) messages. Options (a), (b), and (c) are insufficient or partially incorrect descriptions of the ODF Plus Model Village standards. This question tests the understanding of a specific government program's criteria and the ability to distinguish between similar, yet distinct, designations.




**6. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 included approximately how many Indian universities?**

(a) 75
(b) 91
(c) 64
(d) 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

The other options present incorrect numbers. This question tests factual recall of specific data from a global university ranking.


**7. Which of the following is NOT a key factor used in the 'Global 2000' 2023 report by the Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR)?**

(a) Quality of Education
(b) Employability
(c) Student Satisfaction
(d) Research Performance

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The CWUR's 'Global 2000' report uses Quality of Education, Employability, Quality of Faculty, and Research Performance as its four key ranking factors. Student satisfaction is not included in their methodology. This question tests the ability to recall specific details about a university ranking system and identify incorrect components.

(a) Funding research in educational technology.
(b) Developing standardized educational software.
(c) Free exchange of ideas on using technology to enhance learning, assessment, and administration.
(d) Training teachers in the use of educational technology.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NETF's primary goal is to facilitate the open sharing of knowledge and best practices related to the application of technology in education.  While the other options might be indirectly related, they are not the central function of NETF.  This question tests an understanding of the NEP 2020's vision for educational technology and the role of the NETF.


**9. Which ministry is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Human Resource Development (now Ministry of Education)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the primary government body responsible for the development and welfare of Scheduled Tribes in India.  The other ministries have related responsibilities but do not have the primary focus on ST welfare. This question tests factual knowledge of government ministries and their respective responsibilities.


**10.  Which of the following Acts primarily deals with the prohibition of employment as manual scavengers and their rehabilitation?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(d) The Right to Information Act, 2005

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, specifically addresses the issue of manual scavenging, aiming to eliminate the practice and rehabilitate those affected.  The other acts deal with different aspects of human rights and social justice.  This question tests the knowledge of specific legislation related to social issues.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the length and complexity of the source material,  a comprehensive set of questions covering every detail within the 8192 token limit is not feasible.  The questions below aim for a representative sample across various social issues.


**1.  A legal framework exists in India to address complaints of sexual harassment at the workplace.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects a key component of this framework?**

(a) Monetary settlements are a standard part of the conciliation process.
(b) Complaints must be filed within one year of the incident, with no exceptions.
(c) The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) can extend the time limit for filing complaints.
(d) The ICC's authority is limited to recommending actions; it cannot initiate inquiries.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The POSH Act allows for flexibility regarding the timeframe for filing complaints. While a three-month limit is initially stipulated, the ICC possesses the power to extend this deadline, recognizing that various circumstances might hinder timely reporting.  Option (a) is incorrect as monetary settlements are specifically prohibited during conciliation. Option (b) misrepresents the timeframe; a three-month limit exists, extendable by the ICC. Option (d) is incorrect because the ICC has the power to conduct inquiries and recommend actions to the employer.  This highlights the nuanced legal provisions designed to protect victims while ensuring due process.


**2. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, significantly altered the landscape of surrogacy in India. Which of the following accurately reflects a key change introduced by this Act?**

(a) Commercial surrogacy is explicitly legalized under strict regulatory oversight.
(b) Traditional surrogacy is encouraged as a more ethical and accessible method.
(c) Only altruistic surrogacy is permitted, prohibiting monetary compensation beyond medical expenses.
(d) Foreign nationals are now permitted to utilize surrogacy services in India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, aimed to curb exploitative practices within the surrogacy industry.  A core element of this legislation is the explicit prohibition of commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy where the surrogate mother receives only medical expenses and insurance. Option (a) directly contradicts this central tenet. Option (b) is incorrect because the Act favors gestational surrogacy, not traditional surrogacy. Option (d) is also incorrect; the ban on foreign nationals remains in effect.  This demonstrates the Act's focus on ethical considerations and the protection of surrogate mothers.


**3.  India's efforts to eradicate child labour have faced challenges.  Which of the following initiatives is specifically designed to rehabilitate child labourers?**

(a) The PENCiL portal primarily focuses on preventative measures to stop child labor.
(b) The Bachpan Bachao Andolan primarily conducts awareness campaigns.
(c) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, focuses solely on prevention.
(d) The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme establishes rehabilitation centers.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NCLP Scheme is a central government initiative directly addressing the rehabilitation of child labourers.  It establishes special schools and rehabilitation centers to provide education, vocational training, and support to help them reintegrate into society.  Option (a) is incorrect; while PENCiL aids in rescue and rehabilitation, its primary focus is enforcement. Option (b) partially describes the NGO's work, but it's more than just awareness campaigns. Option (c) is incorrect because the Amendment Act, while prohibiting child labor, also includes provisions for rehabilitation. This highlights the multi-pronged approach needed to effectively tackle the issue of child labour.


**4. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, introduced significant changes in India's approach to disability rights.  Which statement accurately reflects a provision of this Act?**

(a)  The Act mandates a minimum of 10% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.
(b) The Act provides for free education for children with any disability, regardless of the degree.
(c) The Act excludes police forces from the reservation policy for PwDs.
(d) The Act recognizes only 10 types of disabilities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act, while providing for reservations in government jobs and higher education, specifically exempts police forces from this policy. This is a legally defined exception, highlighting the complexities of implementing inclusive policies within specific sectors. Option (a) misrepresents the percentage of reservation (it's 4%). Option (b) is incorrect as free education is provided for children with *benchmark* disabilities (at least 40% disability).  Option (d) is incorrect; the Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities. This question showcases the importance of understanding the specific details of legislation concerning disability rights.


**5. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to eliminate manual scavenging. Which statement correctly describes a provision of this Act?**

(a) The Act permits manual scavenging if appropriate protective gear is used.
(b) The Act only addresses the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, not prevention.
(c) The Act criminalizes the construction of sanitary latrines.
(d) The Act holds local authorities responsible for identifying manual scavengers.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Act places the onus on local authorities (municipalities, panchayats, etc.) to conduct surveys and identify individuals engaged in manual scavenging within their jurisdictions.  Option (a) is incorrect; the Act prohibits manual scavenging entirely. Option (b) is inaccurate; it addresses both prevention (by prohibiting insanitary latrines) and rehabilitation. Option (c) is wrong; it criminalizes the construction of *insanitary* latrines, not sanitary ones. This demonstrates the Act's comprehensive approach to tackling manual scavenging, combining both preventative and remedial measures.


These questions demonstrate the application of the specified criteria, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and a high difficulty level through the use of plausible distractors requiring precise knowledge of the legislation and policies discussed.  Further questions could be generated covering other aspects of the provided text, but this set provides a solid foundation.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question assesses factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding, with plausible distractors included.


**1.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently highlighted the need for implementing a specific commission's report related to a marginalized group. Which marginalized group is this report focused on?**

(a) Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b) Scheduled Tribes (STs)
(c) De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)
(d) Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the Idate Commission report, which focuses on the De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs).  The NHRC's emphasis on this report highlights the continued vulnerability and marginalization faced by DNTs in India, despite the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871.  Options (a) and (b) represent other marginalized groups, but the passage specifically mentions the NHRC's concern regarding DNTs. Option (d) is also a marginalized group but is addressed in a separate section of the text, making it irrelevant to this specific NHRC concern. The NHRC's advocacy for the implementation of the Idate Commission report underscores the ongoing need for policy interventions and redressal of historical injustices faced by DNT communities.


**2.  Which state in India has the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Andaman and Nicobar Islands
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of STs, the question specifically asks about PVTGs. Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, exceeding the number in any other state. Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh both have several PVTGs, but neither surpasses Odisha's count as mentioned in the provided text. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, while having some PVTGs, are a Union Territory and not a state.  The concentration of PVTGs in Odisha highlights the unique challenges and vulnerabilities faced by these tribal groups in different regions of India.


**3.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates certain accessibility measures for government offices. What is the key accessibility requirement specified by a recent court judgment concerning these offices?**

(a)  All government offices must be fully wheelchair accessible.
(b)  Government offices must provide sign language interpreters for all services.
(c) Government offices in inaccessible buildings must relocate services to accessible locations within the same facility or to the ground floor.
(d) Government offices must offer online services to accommodate all disabilities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text explains that a court judgment mandated the relocation of services in inaccessible buildings to accessible locations within the same facility, or to the ground floor. This highlights the focus on practical and immediate accessibility solutions. While options (a), (b), and (d) are all potentially desirable accessibility measures, they are not explicitly mentioned as court-mandated requirements in the given context. The court's decision reflects a pragmatic approach to ensuring accessibility for PwDs, emphasizing the immediate need to make existing services accessible rather than requiring completely new infrastructure.


**4.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) aims to eliminate a particular practice. What specific practice does this act primarily prohibit?**

(a)  The employment of individuals in hazardous waste removal.
(b)  The employment of individuals in cleaning of industrial waste.
(c) The manual removal of human excreta from insanitary latrines, sewers, or septic tanks.
(d) The employment of individuals to clean public spaces without proper safety equipment.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act specifically targets the manual removal of human excreta, a practice deeply rooted in caste-based discrimination. Options (a), (b), and (d) address broader occupational safety concerns but do not represent the core focus of the PEMSR Act. The act's emphasis on the elimination of manual scavenging highlights the critical need to address this dehumanizing practice and rehabilitate those affected. The specific targeting of human excreta removal underscores the historical and social dimensions of the issue.


**5. Which of the following is NOT a key criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High levels of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) A declining or stagnant population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that low literacy is a criterion for identifying PVTGs.  High levels of literacy would indicate a more developed and integrated community, contradicting the characteristics of a PVTG. The other options—pre-agricultural technology, economic backwardness, and declining/stagnant population—are all consistent with the vulnerability of PVTGs. The inclusion of literacy as a criterion reflects the interconnectedness of education, economic development, and social progress for these groups.


**6.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 categorizes India's hunger level as:**

(a) Low
(b) Moderate
(c) Serious
(d) Alarming

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that India is categorized as "Serious" on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale.  The other options are not consistent with the provided information. The GHI ranking and categorization provide a valuable metric for assessing the progress and challenges related to food security and nutrition in India.  The "Serious" categorization necessitates a focused approach to address the underlying causes of hunger and malnutrition.


**7. The  National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate credits earned through which educational streams?**

(a) Higher education and vocational training only.
(b) School education and higher education only.
(c) School education, higher education, and vocational & skill education.
(d) Vocational and skill education only.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF explicitly aims to integrate credits from school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education.  The other options do not fully encompass the NCrF's objective of creating a unified credit framework across all three sectors.  The integration of credits aims to enhance flexibility and mobility for learners, providing pathways for skill development, further education, and career advancement.


**8.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, subsumed which existing statutory body?**

(a) The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
(b) The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
(c) The Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
(d) The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions that the Anusandhan NRF repealed the SERB Act, 2008, and integrated the SERB into the NRF.  The other options are independent research and development organizations in India but were not subsumed by the NRF. The subsumption of SERB underscores the government's strategy for streamlining and centralizing research funding and coordination in India.


**9.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses on strengthening and upgrading which existing system?**

(a) The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM)
(b) The Public Distribution System (PDS)
(c) The Anganwadi system
(d) The National Health Policy 2017

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The passage clearly states that Saksham Anganwadis is a targeted intervention aiming to improve the Anganwadi Centers. The other options represent distinct government programs related to health, food distribution, and health policy but are not the direct focus of the Saksham Anganwadi initiative.  The Saksham initiative highlights the government's commitment to strengthening early childhood care and development programs.


**10.  Which international organization released the report titled ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’?**

(a) The World Bank
(b) The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
(c) The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the UNHCR released the report titled 'Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report'. The other options are international organizations, but they are not associated with the mentioned report. The report's release by UNHCR underscores the growing global concern about forced displacement and the need for international cooperation to address this issue.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring in-depth knowledge and analysis.  The explanations provide detailed justifications for the correct answers and address potential misconceptions.

**1.  The legal framework in India addresses child offenses with varying degrees of severity.  Considering the penalties, which category of offense involves the most stringent punishment under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 (prior to amendments)?**

(a) Petty offenses
(b) Serious offenses
(c) Heinous offenses
(d) Offenses involving physical harm

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, categorized offenses into three levels: petty, serious, and heinous.  Heinous offenses, defined as those carrying a minimum punishment of seven years' imprisonment or more under the IPC or other relevant laws, received the most severe penalties.  Serious offenses had a punishment range of three to seven years, while petty offenses had a maximum punishment of up to three years. Option (d) is too broad and doesn't specify the legal classification used in the Act.  The question specifically targets the legal classification and its associated penalties, demanding precise factual recall and understanding of the legal framework.


**2.  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, significantly impacts the legal definition of childhood in India.  Which statement BEST reflects the Act's influence on the age of consent?**

(a) The POCSO Act lowered the age of consent to 16.
(b) The POCSO Act explicitly defines the age of consent as 18.
(c) The POCSO Act's definition of "child" indirectly establishes the age of consent as 18.
(d) The POCSO Act has no bearing on the legal age of consent.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The POCSO Act defines a "child" as anyone below 18 years old. While it doesn't explicitly state the age of consent, its broad definition of a child implicitly sets the age of consent for sexual activity at 18.  Subsequent amendments to the IPC, influenced by the POCSO Act, further solidified this age. Option (a) is incorrect because the Act did not lower the age. Option (b) is incorrect because it doesn't directly define the age of consent but establishes a definition of "child." Option (d) is incorrect because the act’s definition of a child heavily influences the legal understanding of the age of consent.  This question assesses conceptual understanding and the ability to infer legal implications from a legislative act.


**3. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, introduced significant changes to surrogacy practices in India. Which type of surrogacy is specifically prohibited under this Act?**

(a) Altruistic surrogacy
(b) Gestational surrogacy
(c) Traditional surrogacy
(d) Commercial surrogacy

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, aims to regulate surrogacy and prevent exploitation.  It explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, where monetary compensation beyond basic medical expenses is involved.  Altruistic surrogacy, where the surrogate receives no financial benefit, is permitted under specific conditions.  The Act doesn't ban gestational or traditional surrogacy outright but regulates them to prevent exploitation.  The question tests factual recall of specific legal provisions and their implications.


**4.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates specific reservations for individuals with disabilities in various sectors.  Which of the following sectors is EXCLUDED from the reservation mandate of this Act?**

(a) Government-aided higher educational institutions
(b) Government jobs
(c) Police forces
(d) Private sector employment

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates reservations for persons with disabilities in government-aided higher educational institutions and government jobs. However, this reservation is explicitly excluded from police forces (including the Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, and Delhi/UT police).  The Act doesn't directly address reservations in the private sector. This question tests knowledge of specific exceptions within a legislative framework, highlighting the nuances of policy implementation.


**5.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), aims to eradicate manual scavenging in India.  Which of the following practices is NOT explicitly prohibited under this Act?**

(a) Employing individuals to clean insanitary latrines without protective gear
(b) Constructing insanitary latrines
(c) Employing individuals to clean sewers and septic tanks with appropriate protective gear
(d) Employing individuals as manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act strictly prohibits the employment of individuals for manual scavenging in insanitary conditions.  It aims to eliminate hazardous manual scavenging. However, the Act permits cleaning human waste if appropriate protective gear and equipment are used.  Options (a), (b), and (d) directly violate the Act's core provisions.  The question necessitates a careful understanding of the exceptions and limitations within the Act, requiring close reading and analysis of the legal text.


**6.  The National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) 2019-2021, revealed concerning data on spousal violence in India.  According to this survey, which state reported the HIGHEST percentage of spousal abuse among ever-married women aged 18-49 years?**

(a) Bihar
(b) Telangana
(c) Manipur
(d) Karnataka

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** NFHS-5 data indicated that Karnataka reported the highest percentage of spousal abuse among the states listed. While Bihar, Manipur, and Telangana also had high rates, Karnataka's rate was the highest among them. The question demands precise recall of survey data and the ability to differentiate between high and highest values.


**7.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, introduced several changes to the legal framework governing various crimes.  Regarding marital rape, which statement accurately reflects the BNS's provision in Section 63?**

(a) Marital rape is explicitly criminalized.
(b) The age of consent for marital rape is raised to 18.
(c) The age of consent for marital rape remains at 15.
(d) The marital rape exception is removed, but only for women over 18.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The BNS, 2023, raised the age of consent for sexual intercourse within marriage from 15 to 18. However,  it retains the marital rape exception.  The act does not criminalize marital rape entirely.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the BNS's stance on marital rape. This question tests detailed knowledge of specific legal provisions and their implications for women's rights.


**8.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), established a grievance redressal mechanism. Which entity is mandated to constitute a Local Committee under the POSH Act?**

(a) The National Commission for Women
(b) The employer
(c) The District Officer
(d) The Internal Complaints Committee

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The POSH Act mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations with 10 or more employees. However, for organizations with fewer than 10 employees or if the complaint is against the employer, the District Officer is responsible for constituting a Local Committee to handle complaints. This question tests knowledge of the specific organizational structure and responsibilities under the Act.


**9. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), 2023, proposed significant changes to the school curriculum.  Which of the following is NOT a key focus area of the NCF-SE?**

(a) Integrating environmental education at all stages
(b) Emphasizing capacities for scientific inquiry
(c) Introducing interdisciplinary areas of study at the primary level
(d) Promoting holistic education across various disciplines

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE, 2023, emphasizes holistic education incorporating environmental studies, scientific inquiry, and interdisciplinary approaches. While interdisciplinary studies are encouraged, the framework specifically mentions their introduction as a *separate subject of study* at the secondary stage, not the primary level. The question tests the ability to recall specific details from the curriculum framework.


**10. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to revolutionize the Indian education system. Which of the following is NOT a core objective of the NCrF?**

(a) Seamless integration of credits across different educational levels
(b) Providing multiple entry and exit options for learners
(c) Establishing a rigid, standardized curriculum across all disciplines
(d) Enhancing flexibility and mobility for students

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF aims to create a flexible and integrated credit system, allowing students to accumulate and transfer credits across various educational pathways.  It promotes lifelong learning and mobility.  However, it does not advocate for a rigid, standardized curriculum but rather for a more flexible and adaptable system. The question assesses understanding of the framework's core principles and its intended impact.


**1.  Which group is officially recognized by the Indian government as particularly vulnerable among Scheduled Tribes, initially identified in 1973 based on a commission's recommendations and later renamed in 2006?**

(a) Nomadic Tribes
(b) De-notified Tribes
(c) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(d) Scheduled Castes

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  These groups were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961).  The government of India renamed them PVTGs in 2006.  Options (a) and (b) represent other vulnerable tribal groups, but they are not the specific category described in the question. Option (d) refers to a different scheduled category altogether. The question tests factual recall regarding the specific terminology, timeline, and governmental recognition of this vulnerable tribal population segment.  Understanding the evolution of the terminology and the underlying rationale for their classification is crucial for comprehending India's approach to tribal welfare.


**2.  Which state in India has the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Jharkhand

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Odisha.  While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs, with 13.  This question tests factual recall of specific data related to the geographical distribution of PVTGs within India.  It highlights the uneven distribution of vulnerability among tribal communities and underscores the need for targeted interventions based on regional disparities. Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh also have significant PVTG populations, making them plausible but incorrect distractors.  Jharkhand, while having a substantial tribal population, does not have the highest number of PVTGs.


**3.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, later repealed, categorized certain communities as "born criminals." Which particularly vulnerable group in India was primarily affected by this Act?**

(a) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(b) Scheduled Castes
(c) De-notified Tribes (DNTs)
(d) Nomadic Tribes

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) De-notified Tribes (DNTs). The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 specifically targeted nomadic and semi-nomadic communities, many of whom were later categorized as DNTs. This act exemplifies historical injustices faced by these groups, highlighting the need for redressal and rehabilitation efforts.  While some PVTGs may have been indirectly impacted, the act directly and disproportionately affected DNTs.  Scheduled Castes and Nomadic Tribes, while also facing discrimination, are not the primary focus of the Criminal Tribes Act's impact. This question tests knowledge of historical legislation and its impact on marginalized communities, requiring an understanding of social justice issues and the long-term consequences of discriminatory policies.


**4. Which ministry in the Indian government is the nodal ministry responsible for addressing the welfare of Scheduled Tribes?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Panchayati Raj
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Rural Development

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs. This ministry is specifically mandated to address the welfare and development of Scheduled Tribes in India.  The other options, while involved in some aspects of social welfare, do not have the primary responsibility for tribal welfare.  Understanding the roles and responsibilities of different government ministries is crucial for comprehending policy implementation and governance in India.  This question tests factual recall of specific governmental structures and their mandates related to social welfare policies.


**5.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates certain accessibility requirements for government offices. Which of the following is a key provision of this Act regarding building accessibility for people with disabilities?**

(a)  Mandatory installation of ramps in all government buildings.
(b)  Provision of sign language interpreters in all government offices.
(c)  Relocation of services to accessible locations within the same facility if the building is not accessible.
(d)  Reservation of parking spaces for people with disabilities in all government office complexes.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c).  The Act mandates that government offices in inaccessible buildings must relocate their services to the ground floor or other accessible locations within the same facility. Options (a), (b), and (d), while desirable, are not explicitly mandated as universal requirements in the Act.  This question tests the understanding of specific legal provisions related to accessibility for people with disabilities.  It also highlights the importance of inclusive design and policy implementation in ensuring equal access to public services.


**6.  Which Act in India prohibits the employment of manual scavengers and provides for their rehabilitation?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(d) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. This Act specifically addresses the issue of manual scavenging, a practice that is inherently hazardous and dehumanizing. The other options address different forms of social injustice and exploitation, but not the specific practice of manual scavenging. This question tests knowledge of specific legislation related to occupational safety and the rehabilitation of marginalized workers.  Understanding the legal framework for addressing this issue is crucial for evaluating government efforts to eradicate this exploitative practice.


**7.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) issued guidance on a specific environmental right for children. What is that right?**

(a) The right to a pollution-free environment.
(b) The right to access clean and safe drinking water.
(c) The right to live in a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.
(d) The right to environmental education.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The UNCRC guidance emphasizes the right of children to live in a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment, encompassing aspects of air and water quality, access to green spaces, and protection from environmental hazards.  While options (a), (b), and (d) are related and important elements of children's rights, they are not the specific focus of the UNCRC guidance mentioned. This question tests knowledge of international human rights conventions and their relevance to environmental protection.  It highlights the interconnectedness of human rights and environmental sustainability.


**8.  Which of the following is a key feature of the National Credit Framework (NCrF) in India?**

(a) It mandates a uniform curriculum across all levels of education.
(b) It establishes a digital platform for storing academic credits earned from various institutions.
(c) It restricts the number of exit points in higher education.
(d) It focuses solely on higher education and excludes vocational training.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). The NCrF establishes the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) to digitally store credits earned through school, higher education, and vocational training, enabling flexibility and mobility in education. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the NCrF's key features.  The NCrF promotes flexibility and integration across different educational pathways, not uniformity or restriction. This question tests understanding of educational policy reforms in India and the implications of credit-based systems.  It highlights the shift towards more flexible and integrated approaches to learning and skill development.


**9.  Which two organizations jointly released the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(b)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and World Bank
(c)  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
(d)  International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Health Organization (WHO)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. These two NGOs are responsible for compiling and releasing the GHI report annually.  The other options list organizations involved in development and humanitarian work but are not the specific entities responsible for the GHI.  This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their contributions to global development issues.  It highlights the role of NGOs in providing data and analysis on hunger and malnutrition.


**10. Which Indian institution topped the overall category in the 2023 edition of India Rankings of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs)?**

(a) Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi
(b) Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore
(c) IIT Madras
(d) IIT Bombay

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) IIT Madras.  In the 2023 India Rankings, IIT Madras secured the top position in the overall category.  IISc Bangalore, while a leading institution, did not rank first overall.  IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay are also prestigious institutions, but they did not achieve the top overall ranking in 2023.  This question tests knowledge of higher education rankings in India and the relative performance of different institutions.  It highlights the importance of institutional rankings in evaluating the quality of higher education.


**1.  Which statement accurately reflects the current status of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a)  Arunachal Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs.
(b)  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, and a growing population.
(c)  The term "PVTGs" replaced "PTGs" in 2006.
(d)  Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh share no PVTG communities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the Indian government officially renamed Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in 2006.  Option (a) is incorrect; Odisha currently houses the highest number of PVTGs. Option (b) is also incorrect; a declining or stagnant population is a criterion for PVTG designation, not a growing one. Option (d) is false; the text explicitly mentions Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes as PVTGs present in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, highlighting the shared nature of some PVTG communities across states.  Understanding the evolution of terminology and the specific criteria used for identifying PVTGs is crucial for comprehending India's tribal welfare policies and their implementation.  The continuous monitoring and reclassification of these groups reflect the dynamic nature of social and economic development within tribal communities.


**2. Considering the information provided on Denotified Tribes (DNTs), which statement is accurate?**

(a)  All nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs.
(b)  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 remains in effect today.
(c)  The Hakki Pikki tribe is an example of a nomadic tribal group.
(d)  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (d).  August 31st is indeed celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities. Option (a) is incorrect; while all DNTs are nomadic tribes, not all nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs. Option (b) is incorrect; the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed. Option (c) is also incorrect; the Hakki Pikki tribe is specifically identified as a *semi-nomadic* group, not a nomadic group in its entirety.  The accurate identification of DNTs and their distinct characteristics is vital in understanding the historical context of their marginalization and the ongoing efforts towards their social and economic empowerment.  The celebration of Vimukta Jatis Day highlights the community's resilience and assertion of identity.


**3.  Which of the following accurately describes a key feature of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act)?**

(a)  The RPwD Act mandates reservation for PwDs in all branches of the police force.
(b)  The RPwD Act recognizes fewer than 21 types of disabilities.
(c)  The RPwD Act does not provide for free education for children with benchmark disabilities.
(d)  The RPwD Act defines "person with benchmark disability" as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d). The RPwD Act explicitly defines a "person with benchmark disability" as having at least 40% of a specified disability. Option (a) is incorrect; the act specifically excludes police forces from the reservation policy. Option (b) is incorrect; the act recognizes 21 types of disabilities. Option (c) is also incorrect; free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18 is a key provision of the RPwD Act.  Understanding the precise definition of "benchmark disability" and the specific exceptions within the reservation policy are crucial for interpreting and implementing the RPwD Act effectively. The inclusion of free education underscores the Act's commitment to inclusive education for children with disabilities.


**4.  Which of the following is a correctly matched pair regarding government initiatives for tribal welfare?**

(a)  Ministry of Tribal Affairs –  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes
(b)  Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment –  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs
(c)  Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment –  National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem
(d)  Ministry of Rural Development – Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment is indeed responsible for the Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs. Option (a) is incorrect; the Ministry of Tribal Affairs focuses on tribal welfare, not specifically DNTs. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes is under a separate Ministry.  Option (c) is incorrect; the National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem is associated with the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). Option (d) is also incorrect; the Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The correct identification of the ministries responsible for specific schemes is crucial for understanding the allocation of resources and the coordination of efforts in tribal and DNT welfare.


**5.  Regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), which statement is true?**

(a)  The NCF-SE maintains the existing four-stage schooling structure.
(b)  NCF-SE proposes a single board examination for Grades 10 and 12.
(c)  NCF-SE advocates for proficiency in at least three languages, with only one necessarily being Indian.
(d)  The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (d). The NCF-SE proposes a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the previous four-stage system. Option (a) is therefore incorrect. Option (b) is also incorrect; the NCF-SE allows students to take board examinations on at least two occasions during a school year. Option (c) is incorrect; it promotes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.  The shift to a 5+3+3+4 structure, the allowance for multiple board examinations, and the emphasis on multilingualism within the NCF-SE represent a significant departure from previous educational frameworks. These changes reflect a broader effort to improve the quality and accessibility of education in India.


**6. Which statement accurately reflects the information provided on the National Credit Framework (NCrF)?**

(a)  The NCrF is a framework solely for higher education.
(b)  The NCrF excludes vocational and skill education.
(c)  The NCrF aims to integrate credits from school, higher education, and vocational/skill education.
(d)  The NCrF was developed independently by the UGC.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c). The NCrF explicitly aims to create a single, integrated framework to seamlessly accumulate and transfer credits earned across school education, higher education, and vocational/skill education. Option (a) is incorrect because the NCrF is designed to be inclusive of various educational pathways. Option (b) is also incorrect as vocational and skill education is a core component of the framework. Option (d) is incorrect because the NCrF was developed by a high-level committee involving multiple stakeholders, not solely the UGC.  The NCrF's integrative approach reflects a broader effort to make education more flexible and accessible for learners by recognizing and valuing diverse learning experiences.  This initiative is crucial for creating a more cohesive and equitable education system in India.


**7. Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023?**

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), released the India Ageing Report 2023.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect; while these organizations produce important reports, they are not associated with the release of the India Ageing Report 2023.  This report’s release highlights the increasing importance of understanding demographic shifts and their implications for policy-making in India. The collaboration between UNFPA and IIPS signifies the global and national focus on addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by an aging population.


**8.  Which of the following correctly identifies the organization responsible for the release of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition?**

(a)  UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(b)  UN Committee on Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(c)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(d)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; these organizations have different mandates and do not release this specific report.  The release of this report underscores the global focus on monitoring progress towards the SDGs and identifying areas requiring greater attention and action. The report's "Special Edition" nature likely reflects a need for a more in-depth analysis of progress in light of recent global events.


**9.  Which institution is responsible for releasing the Global Gender Gap Index?**

(a)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(b)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(c)  World Economic Forum
(d)  International Labour Organization (ILO)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index annually. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; while these organizations produce important reports related to gender equality and development, they are not responsible for the Global Gender Gap Index.  The annual release of the Global Gender Gap Index provides a benchmark for tracking progress on gender equality across various dimensions. This data is crucial for informing policy decisions and promoting gender-equitable development globally.


**10. Which body is responsible for accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) in compliance with the Paris Principles?**

(a)  UN Committee on Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(b)  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(c)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is responsible for reviewing and accrediting NHRIs in compliance with the Paris Principles.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; these organizations have different mandates and do not perform this accreditation function. The accreditation process by GANHRI ensures that NHRIs meet international standards for human rights protection and promotion.  The Paris Principles serve as a crucial framework for evaluating the effectiveness and independence of NHRIs worldwide.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to the specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth understanding and recall of specific details.


**1.  A centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, while also aiming to reduce mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition rates.  Which scheme is being described?**

(a)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b)  Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(c)  Anganwadi Services Scheme (now Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0)
(d)  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description clearly points to the Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed as Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0. This scheme, a centrally sponsored initiative under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), directly addresses the nutritional and health needs of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Its primary objectives are to improve their nutritional and health status and to significantly reduce mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition rates among these vulnerable groups.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on broader health coverage, Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets immunization, and the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) provides a broader framework for nutritional interventions but doesn't directly deliver services in the same way as the Anganwadi scheme.


**2.  The Union Cabinet approved a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme aimed at developing offshore wind energy projects. Which ministry is the nodal agency for coordinating the implementation of this scheme?**

(a) Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of New and Renewable Energy
(d) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy serves as the nodal ministry for coordinating the implementation of the VGF scheme for offshore wind energy projects.  The other ministries listed have different areas of focus, making them unsuitable as the nodal agency for this specific energy initiative. The question tests factual recall of the nodal ministry responsible for a specific government scheme.


**3.  A mobile-based application is being tested by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to aid police in recording crime scenes and evidence.  What is the name of this application?**

(a)  Poshan Tracker
(b)  eSakshya
(c)  ICDS-CAS
(d)  Agnibaan


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question specifically asks for the name of the mobile application being tested by the Ministry of Home Affairs to assist police in documenting crime scenes and evidence. The passage clearly identifies this application as "eSakshya."  The other options are unrelated; Poshan Tracker is a nutrition monitoring app, ICDS-CAS is a data management system, and Agnibaan is a rocket. This question assesses factual recall of a specific government initiative.


**4.  Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023, in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage directly states that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS). The other options are involved in different areas of work and are therefore incorrect. This question assesses factual recall of an organization's activity.


**5.  A report titled "Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)" was recently released by which organization?**

(a)  UNICEF
(b)  IFPRI
(c)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(d)  UNFPA


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text clearly states that the World Health Organization (WHO) released the report "Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)." UNICEF is mentioned in relation to a different WASH report, IFPRI focuses on food policy, and UNFPA deals with population issues.  The question assesses the ability to recall the source of a specific report on public health.


**6.  Which Act prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all forms of employment and restricts the employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations?**

(a)  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(b)  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(c)  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(d)  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, specifically addresses the prohibition of child labor below the age of 14 and restricts the employment of adolescents in hazardous occupations.  The other acts deal with different aspects of social welfare and child protection, but not directly with the specific issue of child labor.  This question tests the understanding of specific legislation related to child welfare.


**7.  The "Triple Threat Report," which examines the combined challenges of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) faced by children, was released by which organization?**

(a)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  UNICEF


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions that UNICEF released the "Triple Threat Report" focusing on the combined WASH-related threats to children.  The other options are involved in other domains, making them unsuitable as the source of this specific report. This question tests the ability to recall the organization associated with a specific report.


**8.  A national protocol for Divyang children was recently launched by which ministry to track and assist children with disabilities?**

(a)  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b)  Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c)  Ministry of Women and Child Development
(d)  Ministry of Education


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) launched the national Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children.  The other ministries have different mandates, making them incorrect. This question assesses the ability to link a specific government initiative with the responsible ministry.


**9.  Which act provides for the establishment of the National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) to regulate nursing and midwifery education and training in India?**

(a)  The National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019
(b)  The National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023
(c)  The NNMC Act, 2023
(d)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions that the NNMC Act, 2023, established the National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) to regulate nursing and midwifery education and training.  The other options are related to other medical regulatory bodies or different social welfare issues. This question tests knowledge of specific legislation.


**10.  The Global Food Policy Report 2023, focusing on rethinking food crisis responses, was released by which institution?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(c)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  UNHCR


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text specifies that the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) released the Global Food Policy Report 2023. The other organizations are involved in different areas, making them incorrect. This question tests the ability to recall the source of a specific report.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring in-depth knowledge and analysis, and avoids direct replication of the source material.


**1.  A legal framework governs the adoption of children in India, encompassing both domestic and international processes.  Which of the following entities is NOT directly involved in the formal adoption process as outlined in current Indian legislation?**

(a)  District Child Protection Unit (DCPU)
(b)  Authorized Foreign Adoption Agency (AFAA)
(c)  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)
(d)  National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) plays a crucial role in advocating for and monitoring children's rights, including those related to adoption. However, it doesn't directly participate in the administrative processes of adoption as defined by the Juvenile Justice Act and related regulations.  The DCPU identifies and places children in care, AFAs facilitate international adoptions, and CARA oversees the overall adoption process. NARTSB focuses on assisted reproductive technology and surrogacy, entirely separate legal domains.  The NCPCR's role is primarily oversight and advocacy, not direct involvement in the legal procedures of adoption.  Therefore, while crucial for child welfare, it is not directly involved in the formal mechanisms of adoption outlined in current Indian law.



**2.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) established mechanisms for addressing workplace harassment.  Which of the following is NOT a key feature of the POSH Act's complaint mechanism?**

(a)  The Act mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in workplaces with ten or more employees.
(b)  The Act allows for conciliation attempts before a formal inquiry, but monetary settlements are explicitly prohibited.
(c)  The Act permits ICCs to recommend action against individuals who file false complaints, in accordance with company service rules.
(d)  The Act requires complaints to be filed within one year of the incident, with no possibility of extension.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act allows for complaints to be filed within three months of the incident, a timeframe that can be extended by the ICC. Options (a), (b), and (c) accurately reflect key components of the POSH Act's complaint mechanism. The Act indeed mandates ICCs in larger workplaces, prohibits monetary settlements during conciliation, and grants ICCs the power to recommend action against those filing false complaints, adhering to established company regulations. Option (d) presents a false timeframe, making it the incorrect answer. The flexibility in the complaint filing period is a crucial aspect of the Act, recognizing the complexities and potential delays in reporting such sensitive matters.


**3.  India's efforts to address child labour involve various legislative and programmatic initiatives. Which of the following is NOT a central element of India's strategy to combat child labour?**

(a)  Ratification of key ILO conventions concerning minimum age of employment and worst forms of child labour.
(b)  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibiting child employment below 14 years.
(c)  The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme, establishing special schools and rehabilitation centres.
(d)  The establishment of a nationwide network of "Child Labour Free Zones" across all Indian districts.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While India has made significant strides in combating child labour through legislation, policy, and programs like those mentioned in options (a), (b), and (c), the concept of a completely "Child Labour Free Zone" across all districts is not a formally established, nationwide initiative.  The NCLP focuses on specific areas with high child labour prevalence, and while the goal is to eliminate child labour nationwide, a formal "Child Labour Free Zone" designation encompassing all districts is not a feature of current policy.  The other options represent concrete and existing components of India's strategy.  This highlights the distinction between aspirational goals and currently implemented programs in tackling this complex social issue.


**4.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA) provides a legal framework to address domestic abuse.  Which of the following is NOT a provision or characteristic of the PWDVA?**

(a)  The Act defines domestic violence broadly to encompass physical, sexual, emotional, and economic abuse.
(b)  The Act provides for a range of relief measures, including protection orders, residence orders, and maintenance.
(c)  The Act explicitly restricts the definition of "domestic relationship" to only married couples, excluding cohabiting partners.
(d)  The Act allows for complaints to be filed by the aggrieved woman herself, or by a protection officer or other designated person.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA's definition of "domestic relationship" is significantly broader than just married couples.  It includes cohabiting partners and other individuals in intimate relationships. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect aspects of the PWDVA. The act's comprehensive definition of domestic violence and its provision for multiple forms of relief, along with the ability for various individuals to file complaints on behalf of the victim, are all key features. Option (c) provides a misrepresentation of the Act’s scope, making it the incorrect answer.  The inclusive nature of its definition of relationships is a significant departure from previous legislation and seeks to provide protection to a wider range of women affected by domestic violence.


**5.  Several government initiatives target the welfare of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). Which of the following statements regarding PVTGs is INCORRECT?**

(a)  PVTGs are recognized based on criteria including pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and declining/stagnant population.
(b)  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for PVTG welfare schemes.
(c)  Odisha currently houses the largest number of PVTG communities in India.
(d)  The government's focus on PVTG welfare primarily involves financial aid, excluding any initiatives related to land or habitat rights.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The government's efforts extend beyond mere financial assistance. Recent examples demonstrate a focus on securing habitat rights for PVTGs under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. Options (a), (b), and (c) accurately represent aspects of PVTG identification and government involvement. The criteria used for identifying PVTGs, the nodal role of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, and Odisha's position as the state with the highest number of PVTG communities are all factual. Option (d), however, provides an inaccurate portrayal of the government’s comprehensive approach.  The inclusion of habitat rights in the government's strategy underscores a move towards a more holistic approach to PVTG welfare, considering their socio-cultural and environmental context.


**6. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) introduced significant changes to India's school education system.  Which of the following is NOT a key feature or recommendation of the NCF-SE?**

(a)  The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based curricular structure, replacing the existing four-stage system.
(b)  The NCF-SE advocates for a multi-lingual approach, encouraging proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two Indian languages.
(c)  The NCF-SE mandates a rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level to maintain academic rigor.
(d)  The NCF-SE emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry, alongside theoretical knowledge.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE actually pushes for flexibility and integration between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level, rather than a rigid separation. Options (a), (b), and (d) are accurate reflections of the NCF-SE's key aspects. The new age-based structure, the emphasis on multilingualism, and the focus on developing scientific inquiry skills are all central components. Option (c) presents a misrepresentation of the framework's approach towards vocational education, highlighting the framework's intent to create more holistic and integrated learning pathways.  The integrated approach aims to provide students with a broader range of skills and knowledge, enhancing their future opportunities.


**7.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) significantly altered the legal landscape for persons with disabilities in India. Which of the following statements about the RPwD Act is FALSE?**

(a)  The RPwD Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and those resulting from acid attacks.
(b)  The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in government jobs, excluding police forces.
(c)  The RPwD Act guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18 years in a school of their choice.
(d) The RPwD Act establishes special courts in every district to ensure swift adjudication of cases under the Act, with no exceptions.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the RPwD Act aims for efficient case resolution, it doesn't mandate special courts in *every* district without exception.  The establishment of such courts is a goal, but its complete implementation across all districts may not be uniformly achieved. Options (a), (b), and (c) accurately reflect provisions of the RPwD Act. The Act's comprehensive list of recognized disabilities, its reservation policy for government jobs (excluding police forces), and its guarantee of free education for children with benchmark disabilities are all accurate. Option (d) presents an overstatement of the Act's immediate implementation capacity, highlighting the challenges in establishing specialized judicial infrastructure across the country.  The focus on swift adjudication is a crucial aspect, but the actual implementation may vary based on practical constraints.


**8. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR Act) aims to eradicate manual scavenging.  Which of the following is NOT a key provision or consequence of the PEMSR Act?**

(a)  The Act prohibits the employment of individuals to handle human excreta from insanitary latrines without proper protective gear.
(b)  The Act mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.
(c)  The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.
(d)  The Act establishes a comprehensive national database of all manual scavengers, ensuring complete and accurate tracking.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the PEMSR Act aims to identify and rehabilitate manual scavengers, it does not establish a comprehensive, nationwide, and completely accurate database of every manual scavenger.  Options (a), (b), and (c) accurately reflect key provisions of the PEMSR Act. The Act explicitly prohibits employing individuals in manual scavenging without proper safety equipment, mandates the elimination of insanitary latrines, and includes provisions for the rehabilitation of those previously engaged in this work. Option (d) presents an overstatement of the Act's capacity for complete data collection, a challenge given the informal and often hidden nature of this occupation. The Act's focus on identification and rehabilitation is crucial, but complete and accurate tracking remains a significant challenge in practice.


**9.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, regulates surrogacy practices in India. Which of the following is NOT a key feature of this Act?**

(a)  The Act permits only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy for financial gain.
(b)  The Act establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) for oversight and regulation.
(c)  The Act allows surrogacy for all couples, irrespective of their marital status or sexual orientation.
(d)  The Act requires written consent for the abortion of a surrogate child, subject to existing legal frameworks.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, does not allow surrogacy for all couples irrespective of their marital status or sexual orientation.  It has specific eligibility criteria. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect provisions of the Act. The prohibition of commercial surrogacy, the establishment of the NARTSB, and the requirement for consent regarding the abortion of a surrogate child are all key features. Option (c) presents a misrepresentation of the Act’s eligibility criteria, highlighting the Act's attempt to balance ethical considerations with the provision of assisted reproductive technologies.  The specific eligibility requirements reflect the government’s attempt to regulate the practice while protecting the rights and well-being of all involved parties.


**10. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, governs the treatment of children in conflict with the law. Which of the following statements regarding the Act's amendments and interpretations is INCORRECT?**

(a)  The 2015 Act, as amended, introduced a provision allowing for children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults in cases of heinous offences.
(b)  The 2015 Act, as amended, redefined "serious offences" to incorporate Supreme Court recommendations from the *Shilpa Mittal v. State of NCT of Delhi* case.
(c)  The 2015 Act, as amended, specifies that all offences will be tried exclusively in specialized Juvenile Courts.
(d)  The 2015 Act, as amended, allows for appeals against adoption orders issued by District Magistrates.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The amended Juvenile Justice Act does not mandate that *all* offences be tried exclusively in specialized Juvenile Courts.  Certain offences may fall under different jurisdictional frameworks. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect aspects of the Act's amendments and interpretations. The provision for trying older juveniles as adults in heinous crimes, the redefinition of "serious offences" based on judicial pronouncements, and the provision for appeals against adoption orders are all accurate. Option (c) presents a simplification of the Act's judicial processes, highlighting the complexity of the legal framework related to juvenile justice.  The varying jurisdictional allocations for different offences reflect the nuanced approach required in dealing with juvenile offenders while balancing their developmental needs with the demands of justice.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and focuses on specific details, requiring factual recall and analytical skills.


**1.  A global partnership established in 1971, focused on research for a food-secured future, houses a major research center founded in 1975 that works in over 60 countries, including India, to provide research-based policy solutions to alleviate poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Which organization is described?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c) Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
(d) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

UDISE+ provides comprehensive data on school infrastructure, enrollment, and teacher information at the district level.  The NAS, on the other hand, assesses the learning outcomes of students through standardized tests.  The combination of these two datasets allows for a holistic evaluation of the school education system's performance, covering both inputs and outputs. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect data sources or lack a crucial component for a comprehensive assessment.  The NSS focuses on broader socio-economic data, while the NEP is a policy document, not a data source. ASER, although valuable, lacks the comprehensive reach of UDISE+.


**2.  Which of the following statements accurately describes the grading system employed in the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for States/UTs?**

(a)  States/UTs are categorized into five grades, ranging from 'Excellent' to 'Needs Improvement'.
(b)  A continuous scale from 0 to 100 is used to rank States/UTs, with higher scores indicating better performance.
(c)  States/UTs are classified into ten grades, with 'Daksh' representing the highest and 'Akanshi-3' the lowest.
(d)  A qualitative assessment is used, with States/UTs described using descriptive terms like 'Satisfactory' or 'Unsatisfactory'.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PGI uses a ten-grade system to categorize States/UTs. This granular approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of performance variations across different regions.  The grades, in descending order, are Daksh, Utkarsh, Ati-Uttam, Uttam, Prachesta-1, Prachesta-2, Prachesta-3, Akanshi-1, Akanshi-2, and Akanshi-3.  This detailed classification is essential for targeted interventions and resource allocation based on specific needs. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the actual grading methodology. The PGI does not use a simple five-grade system or a continuous numerical scale.  A purely qualitative assessment would lack the precision needed for effective policymaking.


**3. According to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, what is the target Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for higher education in India by 2035?**

(a) 30%
(b) 40%
(c) 50%
(d) 60%

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NEP 2020 sets an ambitious goal of achieving at least a 50% GER in higher education by 2035. This signifies a substantial increase from the current GER and reflects the policy's commitment to expanding access to higher education for a larger segment of the eligible population.  Reaching this target would require significant investments in infrastructure, faculty development, and financial aid to make higher education more accessible and affordable. The other options present lower targets that would fall short of the NEP's envisioned expansion of higher education.


**4.  The Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) initiative, as envisioned in the NEP 2020, serves which primary purpose?**

(a) To provide financial assistance to students pursuing higher education.
(b) To facilitate the digital storage and transfer of academic credits earned from various institutions.
(c) To standardize the curriculum across all higher education institutions in India.
(d) To establish a national ranking system for higher education institutions based on credit accumulation.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The ABC is designed to create a digital repository for academic credits earned by students from different institutions. This enables greater flexibility and mobility in higher education, allowing students to transfer credits between institutions and pursue multidisciplinary studies more easily. It promotes a more flexible and personalized learning experience. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. While the ABC might indirectly support affordability, its primary function is not financial aid.  It does not standardize the curriculum, and it is not directly involved in establishing national rankings.


**5. Which organization released the "India Ageing Report 2023"?**

(a) The World Bank
(b) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c) The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
(d) The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "India Ageing Report 2023" was a collaborative effort between the UNFPA and the IIPS.  The UNFPA, a UN agency focused on sexual and reproductive health, provides global expertise on population dynamics and aging. The IIPS, an Indian research institute, brings in-depth knowledge of the Indian demographic context. This collaboration ensures that the report incorporates both international perspectives and specific Indian data. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. While these organizations are involved in development and health-related work, they were not the primary publishers of this specific report.


**6.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate credits earned through which educational pathways?**

(a)  Higher education only.
(b)  School education and higher education only.
(c)  School education, higher education, and vocational/skill education.
(d)  Vocational/skill education only.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF is a comprehensive framework designed to integrate credits earned from school education, higher education, and vocational/skill education. This integration aims to create a more flexible and holistic education system, allowing learners to accumulate credits across various learning pathways and gain recognition for their diverse skills and knowledge.  The other options are too narrow in scope.  The NCrF's goal is to create a seamless system connecting all three educational paths for greater flexibility and mobility.


**7.  The  "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" was published by which organization?**

(a) The International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b) The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c) The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement
(d) Amnesty International

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNHCR is the UN agency mandated to protect refugees and forcibly displaced people globally. The "Global Trends" report is a flagship publication that provides comprehensive data and analysis on forced displacement worldwide.  The UNHCR's expertise and mandate make it the most credible source for such a report. The other options, while involved in humanitarian work, do not have the same specific focus on refugee protection and data collection on a global scale.


**8.  Which  Ministry is the nodal agency for the implementation of tribal welfare schemes in India?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Panchayati Raj

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the central government ministry specifically responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies and programs related to the welfare and development of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India.  Its mandate includes addressing issues related to education, health, employment, and land rights for tribal communities. The other ministries have broader developmental agendas and do not have the same specific focus on tribal welfare.


**9. The  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, primarily aims to achieve what?**

(a)  Improve sanitation infrastructure in urban areas.
(b)  Provide financial assistance to all sanitation workers.
(c)  Eliminate the practice of manual scavenging and rehabilitate those engaged in it.
(d)  Regulate the private sanitation sector.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act of 2013 directly addresses the issue of manual scavenging, a deeply inhumane practice. The act aims to completely eradicate this practice by prohibiting its employment and providing pathways for rehabilitation of those previously engaged in it.  This includes providing alternative employment opportunities and financial assistance to those affected.  While the act indirectly contributes to improved sanitation (a), its primary focus is on the people involved in this dangerous practice (c).  (b) and (d) are outside the scope of the act's central objectives.


**10.  The  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 seeks to achieve which of the following primary goals?**

(a) To increase the number of years of compulsory schooling.
(b) To standardize teaching methodologies across all schools.
(c) To create a more holistic and flexible curriculum that integrates various disciplines.
(d) To introduce a national standardized assessment for all students.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE 2023 emphasizes a shift towards a more holistic and integrated curriculum, moving away from a rigid subject-based approach.  It promotes interdisciplinary learning, experiential learning, and the development of critical thinking skills. This approach aims to foster a more well-rounded education that caters to diverse learning styles and prepares students for the challenges of the 21st century. The other options are not the central focus of this framework, although some aspects of those options might be included as part of the implementation of this curriculum.


**1.  Which entity is responsible for the recognition and categorization of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a) The National Commission for Scheduled Castes
(b) The Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(c) The National Human Rights Commission
(d) The Planning Commission of India

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare and development of tribal communities in India, including the identification and recognition of PVTGs.  The other options are incorrect. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes focuses on the welfare of Scheduled Castes, the National Human Rights Commission protects human rights, and the Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) is involved in economic planning and policy. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs plays a central role in formulating policies and programs for PVTGs,  based on criteria such as pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and population trends. This makes it the definitive authority on PVTG recognition.


**2.  Which state in India houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Jharkhand
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Odisha currently has the largest number (13) of recognized PVTGs within its borders. While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh also have significant PVTG populations, including some groups shared between the two states (like the Baiga), Odisha surpasses them in the total count.  Jharkhand, while having a substantial tribal population, does not house the highest number of PVTGs.  The concentration of PVTGs in Odisha reflects the state's unique geographical features and historical circumstances that have led to the preservation of distinct tribal communities with unique cultural practices and vulnerabilities.


**3. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, later repealed, primarily targeted which segment of Indian society?**

(a)  Individuals involved in organized crime syndicates
(b)  Members of nomadic and semi-nomadic communities
(c)  People engaging in illicit alcohol production
(d)  Those participating in underground revolutionary movements

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was a discriminatory piece of legislation enacted during the British Raj. It targeted nomadic and semi-nomadic communities, labeling them as "criminal tribes" based on prejudiced assumptions about their lifestyles and occupations.  The Act subjected these communities to strict surveillance and control, impacting their livelihoods and social mobility. Its repeal in 1952 was a significant step towards addressing historical injustices against these groups. The other options are incorrect; the Act did not specifically target organized crime, illicit alcohol, or revolutionary movements.


**4. Which legal instrument forms the basis of the UNHCR's work in protecting refugees?**

(a) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(b) The Geneva Conventions of 1949
(c) The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol
(d) The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are the foundational legal frameworks for the UNHCR's mandate. These documents define who is a refugee, outline the rights of refugees, and set forth the obligations of states to protect them. While the other options are related to human rights and international law, they do not specifically define the legal basis for the UNHCR's work with refugees. The Convention and Protocol provide a crucial international legal framework for the protection of refugees, establishing standards for their treatment and the responsibilities of signatory states in providing asylum and assistance.


**5. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is primarily tasked with which of the following functions?**

(a)  Providing healthcare services to DNT communities
(b)  Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs
(c)  Implementing skill development programs for DNTs
(d)  Granting land rights to DNT communities

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCDNT's core mandate is to compile a comprehensive, state-wise list of castes that fall under the category of Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs). This crucial task is fundamental to understanding the demographics and needs of these communities, allowing for targeted welfare programs. While other options mention important aspects of DNT welfare (healthcare, skill development, land rights), these are typically implemented by other government bodies.  The NCDNT's role is specifically focused on establishing accurate data on the composition of DNT communities.


**6. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 mandates a minimum reservation percentage in which of the following sectors?**

(a)  Private sector employment
(b)  Public sector employment and government-aided higher educational institutions
(c)  All levels of government
(d)  The judiciary

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act, 2016 mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs and not less than 5% in government-aided higher educational institutions.  The Act does not directly address reservation in the private sector, all levels of government (some government sectors are excluded), or the judiciary.  The reservation provisions aim to ensure inclusive participation of persons with disabilities in public services and higher education, promoting their social and economic integration.


**7.  Which Act prohibits the practice of manual scavenging in India?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(d) The Right to Information Act, 2005

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, specifically outlaws the practice of manual scavenging and outlines provisions for the rehabilitation of those involved. While other Acts address related issues such as atrocities against Scheduled Castes and the protection of human rights, only the PEMSR Act directly addresses the practice of manual scavenging. The Act aims to eradicate this inhumane practice, providing for alternative employment and social support for those affected.


**8.  Which organization released the report titled ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022’?**

(a)  The International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b)  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  The World Bank
(d)  Amnesty International

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, published the ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022’ report.  This report provides comprehensive data on global forced displacement, highlighting the number of refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons worldwide. The other options are incorrect; while the IOM, World Bank, and Amnesty International work on migration and human rights issues, they did not release this specific report. The UNHCR's report is a key source of information on the global refugee crisis, informing policy and advocacy efforts.


**9. The  'Global 2000' report, ranking universities worldwide, is published by which organization?**

(a) Times Higher Education
(b) QS Quacquarelli Symonds
(c) Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR)
(d)  ShanghaiRanking Consultancy

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR) publishes the ‘Global 2000’ report, which ranks universities globally based on various indicators, including education quality, employability, faculty quality, and research performance.  Times Higher Education, QS Quacquarelli Symonds, and ShanghaiRanking Consultancy are other well-known organizations that publish university rankings, but they do not publish the ‘Global 2000’ report.  The CWUR ranking offers a different perspective on university performance compared to other ranking systems.


**10.  The  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) emphasizes the development of which capacity in science education?**

(a) Rote memorization of scientific facts
(b)  Capacities for scientific inquiry along with acquiring knowledge of fundamental theories, laws, etc.
(c)  Focus solely on practical applications of science
(d)  Emphasis on theoretical understanding only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE advocates for a balanced approach to science education, emphasizing the development of capacities for scientific inquiry alongside the acquisition of knowledge of fundamental scientific theories, laws, and concepts. This approach promotes critical thinking, problem-solving, and a deeper understanding of scientific principles.  The other options present a limited or inaccurate view of the NCF-SE's approach to science education. The framework aims to foster a more holistic and engaging learning experience.


**11. Which Ministry launched the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme?**

(a) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(d) Ministry of Human Resource Development (now Ministry of Education)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) launched the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme. This scheme aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. The other options are incorrect; while those ministries are involved in related social welfare programs, the primary responsibility for this specific scheme rests with the MoWCD.  The Saksham Anganwadi scheme represents a significant investment in early childhood care and nutrition.


**12.  Which international treaty recognizes the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment, including gender-based violence and harassment?**

(a) The UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)
(b) The ILO Convention 190
(c) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(d) The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The ILO Convention 190 is the first international treaty to explicitly address violence and harassment in the world of work. It sets international standards to prevent and address violence and harassment, including gender-based violence and harassment. While CEDAW, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights address aspects of gender equality and human rights, Convention 190 specifically targets violence and harassment in the workplace.  India has not yet ratified this convention.


**13. The  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, includes which of the following forms of abuse under its definition of domestic violence?**

(a)  Financial mismanagement only
(b) Physical, verbal, emotional, economic, or sexual abuse
(c)  Neglect of household chores
(d)  Social ostracism

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PWDVA, 2005, adopts a comprehensive definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse.  It aims to provide a legal framework to protect women from various forms of abuse within the domestic sphere. The other options are incorrect; while these might be elements within a broader context of domestic violence, the PWDVA explicitly lists the forms mentioned in (b).  The Act represents a significant step towards addressing domestic violence in India.


**14. Which  Act governs inter-country and intra-country adoption of children in India?**

(a) The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956
(b) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c) The Guardians and Wards Act, 1890
(d)  The Special Marriage Act, 1954

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and its associated regulations govern both inter-country and intra-country adoption processes in India.  While the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, covers adoption within the Hindu community, the JJ Act provides a broader legal framework for the care and protection of children, including adoption procedures for orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered children. The other options are irrelevant to the adoption process. The JJ Act aims to ensure the well-being of children in need of care and protection.


**15. Which government body is responsible for overseeing and supervising the accreditation of higher educational institutions in India, as envisioned by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020?**

(a) University Grants Commission (UGC)
(b) All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)
(c) National Accreditation Council (NAC)
(d) National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The National Accreditation Council (NAC), a key component of the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI), is envisioned as the primary body for overseeing and supervising the accreditation of higher education institutions.  While UGC and AICTE handle recognition and regulation of specific types of institutions, the NAC will function as a meta-accrediting body, establishing standards and overseeing a network of accrediting agencies.  NAAC currently plays a role in accreditation, but the NEP 2020 aims to restructure this system with the NAC at its helm.  The NAC will ultimately be responsible for the overall quality assurance framework for higher education in India.


**16. Which High-Level Committee was appointed to develop the National Credit Framework (NCrF)?**

(a) The Kasturirangan Committee
(b) The Yashpal Committee
(c) A committee chaired by the UGC Chairperson
(d) A High-Level Committee with members from UGC, AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, CBSE, etc.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NCrF was developed by a High-Level Committee comprising representatives from various key stakeholders including UGC, AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, Ministries of Education and Skill Development, and CBSE.  This multi-stakeholder approach reflects the NCrF's aim to integrate credits across different educational pathways (school, higher education, vocational). The other committees focused on different aspects of education reform.  The composition of this committee highlights the collaborative nature of the NCrF project.


**17.  Which of the following is NOT a key dimension of Universal Health Coverage (UHC)?**

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c) Availability of specific treatments
(d) Quality

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** While availability of healthcare services is important for UHC, the core dimensions are accessibility (physical and financial reach), affordability (cost of services), and quality (effectiveness and safety of care).  UHC aims to ensure access to a comprehensive range of quality health services without financial hardship, but the emphasis is on ensuring access to all essential services, not necessarily every specialized treatment.  Accessibility, affordability, and quality are the crucial pillars for achieving universal health coverage.


**18. Which organization jointly released the ‘Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring Report’?**

(a) UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
(c) The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank
(d) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the WHO

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank jointly published the ‘Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring Report’. This report tracks progress towards universal health coverage globally.  The other options are incorrect; while these organizations are involved in health and development issues, this specific report was a collaborative effort between the WHO and the World Bank.  This partnership reflects the importance of both health policy and financial resources in achieving UHC.


**19. Which index measures the status of women's empowerment and gender equality across the world, focusing solely on women and their power and freedoms?**

(a) Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI)
(b) Global Gender Gap Index
(c) Gender Social Norms Index
(d) Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) specifically measures women's empowerment, focusing on their agency and ability to make choices and seize opportunities. The GGPI compares women's status to men's, while the Global Gender Gap Index and Gender Social Norms Index use broader metrics. The WEI offers a focused assessment of women's capabilities and freedoms, independent of comparisons with men.  The WEI provides valuable insights into the progress of gender equality.

(a) World Economic Forum
(b) United Nations Development Programme
(c) World Health Organization
(d) UN Women

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI), which is jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP.  The WEI focuses solely on women, measuring their power and freedoms to make choices and seize opportunities in life, unlike the Global Gender Gap Index (World Economic Forum) which uses broader parameters, or the Gender Social Norms Index (UNDP) which examines systematic disadvantages and discrimination. The World Health Organization (WHO) is primarily concerned with health issues. Therefore, only UN Women, in collaboration with UNDP, aligns with the question's description. The other options are incorrect because they either focus on broader gender equality metrics or are not directly related to the specific index described.  Understanding the nuances of different indices used to measure gender equality is crucial for UPSC aspirants.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of international organizations and their respective mandates.

Option (b) is incorrect; the criteria include pre-agricultural technology and a *declining or stagnant* population, not a growing one. Option (c) is incorrect; while many PVTGs reside in forested areas, this isn't a universal criterion for their designation, and their location isn't solely determined by forest cover.  The distribution of PVTGs is complex and influenced by various historical and geographical factors.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are all explicitly mentioned as criteria. This question tests the ability to identify specific details within a larger passage and to understand the defining characteristics of a particular social group.

These questions are designed to challenge candidates and assess their understanding of social issues in India, requiring more than superficial knowledge.  They demand a deeper understanding of the nuances of the subject matter.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues.  The questions are designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and analysis, and avoiding simple factual recall.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  A significant Supreme Court judgment highlighted the need for proactive measures to expedite the process of making children in Childcare Institutions available for adoption.  What specific category of children did this judgment primarily focus on?**

(a) Children whose parents are deceased.
(b) Children who have been abandoned by their parents for over a year or have unfit parents/guardians.
(c) Children who have been victims of trafficking.
(d) Children with disabilities residing in specialized institutions.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Temple of Healing v. Union of India judgment specifically addressed children in Childcare Institutions (CCI) whose parents hadn't visited them for over a year or who had "unfit" parents or guardians. This category encompasses situations where parental care is lacking or absent due to various reasons including neglect, abuse, or substance abuse. Options (a), (c), and (d) are not the primary focus of this particular judgment, although these children may also be in need of care and adoption. The judgment emphasizes the need for a proactive approach to identify and bring such children into the adoption pool, improving the chances of finding suitable families for them.  This aligns with the larger goal of child welfare and ensuring a safe and nurturing environment for vulnerable children.


**2.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently advocated for the implementation of a specific commission's report. This report recommended the establishment of a permanent commission to address the concerns of a particular marginalized group. Which group is this?**

(a) Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)
(b) Scheduled Tribes (STs)
(c) De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)
(d) Manual Scavengers

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NHRC's call for implementation of the Idate Commission report specifically relates to De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs).  The report recommended a permanent commission to address the unique challenges and vulnerabilities faced by this group, historically marginalized and often facing systemic discrimination. Options (a), (b), and (d), while representing other vulnerable groups, are not the specific focus of the NHRC's recent advocacy. The DNTs' historical categorization as "criminal tribes" under British rule has left a lasting legacy of social stigma and discrimination, highlighting the need for dedicated mechanisms to protect their rights and promote their welfare.  This underscores the importance of addressing historical injustices and ensuring the inclusion of all marginalized communities.


**3. The 2021 amendment to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act expanded access to abortion services under specific circumstances. Which of the following is NOT a direct consequence of this amendment?**

(a) Extension of the gestational limit for legal abortion.
(b) Inclusion of certain categories of women for accessing abortion services.
(c) Increased availability of safe and legal abortion services.
(d) Mandatory parental consent for all minors seeking abortion.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The 2021 amendment to the MTP Act did *not* mandate parental consent for all minors seeking abortion. While the law addresses specific circumstances and categories of women, the issue of minor's consent is handled differently. The amendment aimed to increase access to safe and legal abortion by extending the gestational limit and including certain categories of women. Option (d) presents a false implication of the amendment, potentially creating a misconception about its provisions.  The nuances of the law concerning minors' access to abortion services need to be understood separately from the broader expansion of access for other groups of women.  Understanding the specific provisions of the amendment is crucial to avoid any misinterpretations.


**4.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for a significant restructuring of the school education system. Which of the following is NOT a core feature of this restructuring?**

(a)  A 5+3+3+4 age-based design for schooling.
(b)  Emphasis on multilingualism, including proficiency in at least three languages.
(c)  Strict separation between academic and vocational subjects.
(d)  Integration of Indian contributions to various disciplines throughout the curriculum.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE explicitly rejects a strict separation between academic and vocational subjects.  It promotes a more holistic and integrated approach to education, allowing for greater flexibility and choice at the secondary stage. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect the NCF-SE's core tenets, emphasizing a revised age-based structure, multilingual education, and the integration of India's rich intellectual history into the curriculum.  The rejection of rigid subject divisions aims to create a more well-rounded and adaptable education system, better preparing students for the diverse demands of the modern world. This integrated approach is a key departure from previous models and aligns with the broader goals of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.


**5.  A specific government initiative aims to improve the nutritional and health status of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. This initiative primarily operates through a network of community-based centers.  What is the name of this initiative?**

(a) Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b) Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(c) Anganwadi Services Scheme
(d) National Health Policy 2017

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Anganwadi Services Scheme (now Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0) is the primary government initiative that directly addresses the nutritional and health needs of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers through a vast network of Anganwadi Centers (AWCs).  While Ayushman Bharat Yojana, Intensified Mission Indradhanush, and National Health Policy 2017 contribute to broader health goals, the Anganwadi system is specifically designed to provide targeted interventions at the community level.  The AWCs deliver essential services such as supplementary nutrition, immunization, health check-ups, and early childhood care and education. This makes it the most accurate answer to the question.  The question highlights the importance of understanding the specific functions and reach of various government programs.


**6. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to eradicate manual scavenging. Which of the following is NOT a direct measure employed by this act to achieve this goal?**

(b)  Providing financial assistance and training for alternative employment to manual scavengers.
(c)  Introducing strict penalties for employing individuals as manual scavengers.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Act actively discourages traditional, unsafe methods of waste disposal.  The Act focuses on modernizing sanitation infrastructure, providing alternative employment opportunities, and penalizing those who continue to employ manual scavengers. Option (d) is directly contradictory to the Act's objectives.  The Act's emphasis on mechanized sanitation and the provision of protective gear highlights a shift away from traditional, hazardous practices.  Understanding the Act's comprehensive approach—from infrastructure improvements to rehabilitation programs and legal consequences—is crucial to grasping its effectiveness in tackling manual scavenging.


**7.  The National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, established a new institution to provide strategic direction for research and innovation in various fields. This act also repealed and subsumed a pre-existing organization. Which organization was subsumed into the NRF?**

(b)  The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)
(c)  The Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
(d)  The Department of Science and Technology (DST)

**Explanation:** The NRF Act, 2023, specifically repealed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008, and integrated SERB's functions into the newly established NRF.  While the other options represent significant scientific organizations, they were not directly subsumed by the NRF.  The integration of SERB into NRF reflects a restructuring of India's research governance, aiming for greater coordination and efficiency in promoting scientific advancement.  The question requires familiarity with the specific organizational changes brought about by the NRF Act.


**8. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs plays a crucial role in the welfare of a specific segment of India's population.  What is the name of this segment?**

(a)  De-notified Tribes (DNTs)
(b)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(c)  Scheduled Tribes (STs)
(d)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is specifically responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes (STs). While other marginalized groups like DNTs, SCs, and OBCs also require attention and support, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs has a dedicated mandate for the ST community.  This highlights the specific focus and responsibility of a particular ministry within the Indian government's structure.  The question tests understanding of the governmental structure and its responsibility towards different sections of society.

(b)  The Ramsar Convention
(c)  The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)
(d)  The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is the specific international agreement that focuses on regulating international trade in endangered species to prevent their extinction. While other conventions like CBD, Ramsar, and UNCCD address environmental concerns, CITES directly addresses the issue of trade in endangered species.

The question tests the knowledge of different indices measuring gender equality and their specific scope.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.  The difficulty level is primarily 'difficult', achieved through nuanced options and the requirement for precise factual recall.


**1.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently emphasized the need to implement a specific commission's report regarding the welfare of certain marginalized groups.  Which commission's report is this?**

(a) Renke Commission
(b) Idate Commission
(c) Dhebar Commission
(d) Mandal Commission

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the NHRC stressed the need to implement the Idate Commission report concerning De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs). The Renke Commission is mentioned in relation to the number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, but not in the context of the NHRC's recommendation. The Dhebar Commission is related to the recognition of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), a different category.  The Mandal Commission focused on Other Backward Classes (OBCs), again a distinct group. Therefore, only the Idate Commission directly addresses the NHRC's concern.  Understanding the specific mandates of each commission is crucial for answering this question correctly.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between various commissions and their areas of focus, a key skill in UPSC preparation.


**2.  A particular tribal group in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh received Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.  Identify this group from the options provided.**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Poshan Tracker app is used for dynamic identification of stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence among children and last-mile tracking of nutrition service delivery.  The other options represent different aspects of the Anganwadi system but are not the primary function of the Poshan Tracker.  This question tests the ability to extract the specific function of a technology-based intervention within a larger social program.  This demonstrates an understanding of the use of technology in social welfare programs and data-driven interventions.


These questions demand precise factual recall and a nuanced understanding of the various social issues discussed in the provided text. They are designed to challenge candidates and assess their ability to analyze and apply their knowledge, reflecting the demanding nature of the UPSC exam.


**1.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, assesses performance at which levels?**

(a) National level only
(b) State and District levels
(c) State level only
(d) District level only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PGI is explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of the school education system at both the State and District levels.  This dual-level assessment allows for a granular understanding of strengths and weaknesses across different geographical regions and administrative units. The index utilizes data from sources like UDISE+ and NAS to provide a comprehensive evaluation.

**5.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate credits earned through which educational pathways?**

(a)  Higher education only
(b)  School education and vocational training only
(c)  School education, higher education, and vocational & skill education
(d)  Higher education and vocational training only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF is a comprehensive framework designed to seamlessly integrate credits earned across school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education.  This integrated approach aims to enhance flexibility and mobility for learners, allowing them to accumulate credits across diverse learning pathways and potentially transfer them between different educational institutions.

(a) 10%
(b) 20%
(c) 30%
(d) 40%

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR's "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" indicated that approximately 30% of the world's forcibly displaced people were children. This statistic highlights the vulnerability of children in conflict and crisis situations, emphasizing the need for targeted protection measures and humanitarian aid. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the actual percentage reported in the UNHCR study.  The high percentage of children among the forcibly displaced underscores the urgent need for child-focused interventions in humanitarian response and long-term resettlement strategies.


**7. The  "Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition" was released by which UN body?**

(a)  UNHCR
(b)  UNFPA
(c)  UNDESA
(d)  UNCRC

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNDESA (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs) is responsible for releasing the SDG progress reports.  As the UN department focused on economic and social development, it's the logical entity to monitor and report on progress towards the SDGs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; while these UN agencies address important aspects of sustainable development, they are not the primary body for releasing the overarching SDG progress reports. The UNDESA's role underscores the importance of comprehensive monitoring and evaluation in achieving the global goals for sustainable development.


**8.  Which  Ministry is the nodal ministry for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Panchayati Raj

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs holds the primary responsibility for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes in India.  This ministry is specifically tasked with formulating and implementing policies and programs aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of ST communities. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; while these ministries address issues related to social welfare, rural development, and local governance, they do not have the specific mandate for ST welfare that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs possesses. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs' central role underscores the Indian government's commitment to addressing the unique challenges faced by ST communities.


**9. Which Act prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all employment in India?**

(a) Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(b) Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(c) Right to Education Act, 2009
(d) Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, explicitly prohibits the employment of children under 14 years of age in all forms of employment.  This act strengthens the legal framework against child labor and aims to protect children's rights to education and development.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect; while these acts address various aspects of child welfare, they do not have the specific mandate of prohibiting all child labor below the age of 14. The 2016 amendment signifies a stronger commitment to eradicating child labor in India.


**10.  Which High-Level Committee developed the National Credit Framework (NCrF)?**

(a) A committee formed solely by the UGC
(b) A committee comprising members from various educational regulatory bodies and ministries.
(c) A committee solely constituted by the Ministry of Education

**Explanation:**

The NCrF was a collaborative effort, with a High-Level Committee comprised of representatives from multiple educational regulatory bodies and ministries, including the UGC, AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, and CBSE.  This multi-stakeholder approach ensured a holistic and integrated framework encompassing different educational streams. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they represent only a partial composition of the committee responsible for developing the NCrF. The NCrF's development process reflects the need for a coordinated and collaborative approach towards integrating different learning pathways within India's educational system.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a nuanced understanding of the topic.


**1.  Consider the following statements regarding the Global Gender Gap Index:**

(a) It is released biennially by the United Nations Development Programme.
(b)  It incorporates parameters related to health and survival, but excludes political empowerment.
(c) India's 2023 ranking reflects a significant improvement compared to previous years.
(d) The index assesses gender parity across economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Global Gender Gap Index is indeed released annually by the World Economic Forum, not biennially by the UNDP (a).  It comprehensively covers health and survival and political empowerment (b).  India's ranking in 2023 (127 out of 146) does not indicate improvement; rather, it highlights persistent gender inequality (c).  Option (d) accurately reflects the index's scope and parameters.  The inclusion of political empowerment is crucial, as it recognizes the importance of women's representation and participation in decision-making processes for achieving gender equality.  The index's multifaceted approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of gender disparities across various sectors, providing a valuable tool for policymakers and researchers to track progress and identify areas needing attention.


**2. Which of the following is NOT a dimension assessed by the Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI)?**

(a) Economic Integrity
(b) Physical Integrity
(c) Educational Attainment
(d) Political Empowerment

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The GSNI, released by the UNDP, focuses on four dimensions: Political, Educational, Economic, and Physical Integrity (b).  While "Economic" is included, the index assesses women's economic opportunities and participation, not "Economic Integrity" (a), which is a different concept entirely. Educational Attainment (c) and Political Empowerment (d) are key components of the index, reflecting the impact of gender norms on women's access to education and their political participation.  The GSNI's focus on these dimensions underscores the interconnectedness of social norms and various aspects of women's lives, recognizing that gender inequality manifests in multiple spheres.


**3. The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI):**

(a)  Is measured on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 representing the worst possible performance.
(b) Tracks SDG 3.8.1 and includes indicators related to non-communicable diseases but excludes reproductive health.
(c) Showed an improvement in India's score between 2019 and 2021.
(d) Is a joint initiative of the WHO and the World Bank, tracking progress towards universal health coverage.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The UHC SCI is indeed a joint WHO-World Bank initiative (d), measuring progress toward UHC.  A score of 100 represents the best possible performance, not the worst (a).  The index includes indicators for reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (along with infectious and non-communicable diseases), making (b) incorrect.  India's score declined from 64 in 2019 to 63 in 2021, indicating a worsening, not an improvement (c).  The SCI’s comprehensive approach to measuring health service coverage is important because it highlights the need for holistic interventions to achieve universal health coverage. Addressing different aspects of health care, from reproductive health to non-communicable diseases, is crucial for improving overall health outcomes and reducing health inequalities.


**4. The "Path to Equal" report introduced which of the following indices to measure women's empowerment and gender equality:**

(a)  Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Equality Index (GGEI).
(b)  Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) and the Women's Development Index (WDI).
(c) Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI).
(d) Global Gender Equality Index (GGEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI).

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "Path to Equal" report, a joint UN Women and UNDP initiative, introduced the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) (c). Option (a) is incorrect as there is no Global Gender Equality Index (GGEI) mentioned in the context. Option (b) is incorrect because the report does not include a Women's Development Index (WDI). Option (d) is incorrect as it combines the fictional GGEI with the GGPI.  The WEI focuses solely on women's agency and capabilities, while the GGPI compares the status of women relative to men across various dimensions. This dual approach provides a comprehensive picture of gender equality, highlighting both the progress made and the persistent disparities that remain.


**5.  The Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT) is primarily tasked with:**

(a) Developing technical terminology in only the eight scheduled languages of India.
(b)  Translating scientific literature into English from Indian languages.
(c) Developing technical and scientific terminology in ten Indian languages underrepresented in the learning landscape.
(d)  Conducting research on the history of scientific terminology in India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The CSTT is indeed working on developing technical and scientific terminology in ten Indian languages, including those underrepresented in education (c).  While eight scheduled languages are included, the CSTT's mandate extends beyond these eight (a).  The commission's focus is on developing terminology, not on translation from Indian languages to English (b).  Historical research is not the CSTT's primary function, though it may be relevant to its work (d). The CSTT's work is crucial for promoting multilingualism and inclusivity in science and technology education, ensuring that knowledge is accessible to a wider population.

(b) Integrate credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, promoting flexibility and mobility.
(c)  Replace the existing system of grading in higher education with a credit-based system.
(d)  Eliminate the need for entrance examinations in higher education.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCrF's primary goal is to create a seamless system for accumulating and transferring credits earned across different educational pathways (b).  It does not mandate a standardized duration for undergraduate degrees (a), nor does it replace the grading system (c) or eliminate entrance exams (d).  The NCrF's framework fosters greater flexibility and mobility in education, enabling learners to pursue diverse educational and vocational opportunities throughout their lives.  This approach aligns with the goals of lifelong learning and personalized education.



**7.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

(a) Assesses performance exclusively at the state level.
(b) Uses data solely from the National Achievement Survey (NAS).
(c) Classifies states/UTs and districts into five grades.
(d)  Is used to assess the performance of the school education system at the state and district levels.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The PGI assesses school education performance at both state and district levels (d).  It utilizes data from UDISE+ and NAS (b is incorrect), classifying states/UTs and districts into ten grades, not five (c is incorrect).  The index provides a comprehensive evaluation of the school education system, enabling policymakers to identify areas of strength and weakness and to allocate resources effectively.


**8.  The National Medical Commission (NMC) received WFME recognition for:**

(a) A period of five years.
(b)  Its efforts to improve primary healthcare access.
(c) A period of ten years.
(d)  Its role in regulating AYUSH practitioners.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NMC received WFME recognition for ten years (c). The recognition is not related to primary healthcare access (b) or AYUSH regulation (d). This recognition signifies a significant step towards improving the quality of medical education in India and aligning it with international standards.


**9.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) recommends:**

(a) A rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects.
(b)  Proficiency in at least two languages, both native to India.
(c) Proficiency in at least three languages, at least two of which should be Indian languages.
(d)  Elimination of board examinations for grades 10 and 12.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE advocates for proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages (c). This reflects a commitment to multilingualism and the recognition of the importance of Indian languages in education.  The framework does not advocate for a rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects (a), nor does it eliminate board exams (d).  The emphasis on multilingualism fosters inclusivity and promotes a deeper understanding of India's rich linguistic diversity.


**10.  The  "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report," released by UNHCR, highlights:**

(a) A decrease in forced displacement compared to 2021.
(b)  That high-income countries host the majority of the world's refugees.
(c)  The significant contribution of climate change to forced migration.
(d)  The complete absence of children among forcibly displaced populations.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UNHCR report highlights the increasing impact of climate change on forced displacement (c).  Forced displacement increased in 2022 compared to 2021 (a is incorrect). Low- and middle-income countries host most refugees (b is incorrect). A significant portion of displaced people are children (d is incorrect).  The report underscores the complex and interconnected nature of displacement, emphasizing the urgent need for global cooperation in addressing this challenge.


Here are some difficult UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  A legal framework in India allows for the bearing and birth of a child by one woman for an intending couple. This practice, subject to specific regulations, involves distinct types based on compensation. Which of the following accurately describes a key feature of "altruistic surrogacy" as defined within this legal framework?**

(a) It involves monetary compensation exceeding basic medical expenses.
(b) It is explicitly prohibited under current Indian law.
(c) It permits the use of donor gametes regardless of the intending couple's genetic contribution.
(d) It involves no monetary compensation beyond medical expenses and insurance coverage.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, in India, legalizes only altruistic surrogacy.  This means the surrogate mother receives no financial compensation beyond the necessary medical expenses and insurance coverage during the pregnancy. Option (a) describes commercial surrogacy, which is illegal in India. Option (b) is incorrect because altruistic surrogacy is permitted. Option (c) is incorrect because, while the amended rules allow for donor gametes under certain medical conditions, the child must still have at least one gamete from the intending couple. The key difference between altruistic and commercial surrogacy hinges on the absence of financial gain beyond essential medical provisions for the surrogate mother. This reflects a policy shift towards ethical and non-exploitative practices in assisted reproductive technology.


**2. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates certain provisions to ensure accessibility and inclusion.  Considering the recent landmark judgments concerning accessibility and airline responsibilities, which of the following statements BEST reflects a key outcome of these legal pronouncements?**

(a) Airlines are exempt from implementing the Act's accessibility provisions for international flights.
(b) Government offices operating in inaccessible buildings must relocate to entirely new facilities.
(c) All airlines operating in India must implement the Act's accessibility provisions for passengers with disabilities.
(d) The Act's reservation provisions for PwDs extend to all branches of the police force.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The court judgments highlighted in the text explicitly state that all airlines operating in India, whether domestic or international, are responsible for implementing the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.  Option (a) contradicts this. Option (b) is an overstatement; the judgment mandates relocation *within* the same facility, if possible, to accessible locations. Option (d) is incorrect because the text specifically states that reservation for PwDs does *not* apply to police forces. The court's decision emphasizes the broad applicability of the Act and the responsibility of all stakeholders, including airlines, to ensure accessibility for PwDs.  This underscores the legal framework's commitment to inclusive practices in the transportation sector.


**3.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to eradicate a harmful practice.  Which of the following actions is explicitly prohibited under this Act?**

(a) Employing individuals to clean sewers with appropriate protective gear.
(b) Constructing sanitary latrines in place of insanitary ones.
(c) Employing individuals to clean insanitary latrines without protective gear.
(d) Providing financial assistance for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Act specifically prohibits the employment of individuals to handle human waste from insanitary latrines without providing necessary protective gear. Option (a) describes a permissible action, as long as appropriate safety measures are in place. Option (b) is a positive step encouraged by the Act. Option (d) is a crucial component of the Act's rehabilitation provisions.  The prohibition in option (c) highlights the Act's core focus on preventing hazardous and exploitative labor practices while promoting the safety and well-being of workers. This reflects a legal commitment to eliminating a deeply rooted social injustice.


**4.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) introduces a significant restructuring of the school education system.  Which of the following is a core feature of the proposed curricular and pedagogical structure?**

(a) A rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects.
(b) A 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.
(c)  Emphasis on monolingual education.
(d)  Elimination of board examinations at Grades 10 and 12.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the earlier four-stage system. Option (a) is incorrect; the framework emphasizes flexibility and choice, blurring the lines between academic and vocational streams. Option (c) is contrary to the framework's promotion of multilingualism. Option (d) is false; the framework retains board examinations but allows students to take them twice.

(b) Recognition from the WFME, leading to automatic accreditation for all existing and new medical colleges for 10 years.
(c) Recognition from UNESCO, enhancing the quality of medical education globally.
(d) Recognition from the UN, improving the overall healthcare system in India.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the NMC received recognition from the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) for a 10-year period. This recognition has significant implications, as it ensures automatic accreditation for all existing (706) and new medical colleges established within the next decade. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the global body involved or the specific implications of the recognition for Indian medical colleges.  The WFME recognition enhances the international standing of Indian medical education, facilitating greater global recognition of Indian medical degrees and boosting the country's healthcare infrastructure.

(a) Children from marginalized communities.
(b)  Individuals with disabilities.
(c)  Members of the transgender community.
(d)  Elderly persons facing social exclusion.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NITI Aayog report explicitly mentions the "Prayatna" project as a livelihood and enterprise training program specifically designed for transgender individuals in the Delhi-NCR region. The other options are not the primary focus of this particular project, although other initiatives address the needs of these groups. The focus on the transgender community reflects a commitment to promoting their economic empowerment and social inclusion.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court judgment discussed in the text specifically concerns the legal recognition of marriages between same-sex couples. The court's decision had significant implications for LGBTQIA+ rights and the legal landscape surrounding marriage in India.  The other options were not the central focus of this particular judgment.  The judgment highlights the ongoing legal and social debates surrounding LGBTQIA+ rights and the evolution of legal frameworks concerning marriage and family structures in India.

(b) The National Credit Framework (NCrF).
(c) The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE).
(d) The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is explicitly linked to the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) system. The ABC system facilitates the storage and transfer of academic credits earned through various educational pathways, including school, higher education, and vocational training. The other options are not directly related to the ABC system. The ABC system represents a significant reform in the Indian education system, promoting flexibility, portability, and lifelong learning opportunities for students.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** ODF Plus status builds upon the basic ODF (Open Defecation Free) status by adding the crucial element of solid and/or liquid waste management systems.  The "Plus" signifies a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to sanitation beyond simply eliminating open defecation.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are elements related to sanitation but don't define the "Plus" aspect of ODF Plus. The ODF Plus status reflects a more holistic approach to rural sanitation, aiming for sustained cleanliness and environmental hygiene.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text about social issues in India, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.


**1.  The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India is found in which state?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Andhra Pradesh
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The text explicitly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, the question specifically asks about PVTGs, a distinct sub-category within the Scheduled Tribes. Chhattisgarh also has a significant number of PVTGs, including some shared with Madhya Pradesh, but Odisha holds the highest overall count according to the provided information.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they don't represent the state with the highest concentration of PVTGs.  Understanding the distinction between Scheduled Tribes and PVTGs is crucial for accurate response. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct concepts.


**2. Which Act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which had detrimental effects on Denotified Tribes (DNTs)?**

(c) The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage directly states that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952.  This highlights the historical context of DNTs and the legislative efforts to address their marginalization. The other options are related to the protection of marginalized communities but do not directly address the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.  The question assesses factual recall of specific legislation and its historical significance in addressing social justice issues.

(a) Private sector employment
(b)  Government jobs and government-aided higher educational institutions
(c)  Membership in the Parliament
(d)  Positions in the judiciary

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly specifies that the RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and not less than 5% reservation in government/government-aided higher educational institutions.  The act does not directly address reservation in the private sector, Parliament, or the judiciary.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific legal provisions related to disability rights and affirmative action policies.


**4. Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  Pre-agricultural level of technology

(c) Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
(d)  Monitoring the implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage directly states that the NCDNT's role is to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs. The other options describe responsibilities of different organizations or programs related to tribal welfare and social justice, but not the primary function of the NCDNT.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the organizational structure and functions within the Indian government's approach to addressing social issues.


**6.  Which Ministry is the nodal ministry for the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN)?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Panchayati Raj

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly mentions that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare initiatives, which includes PM JANMAN. While other ministries contribute to the program's implementation, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs holds the primary responsibility.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of governmental organizational structures and responsibilities.


**7. The "Triple Threat" report by UNICEF highlights which interconnected challenges faced by children?**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage defines the "triple threat" as the combination of limited access to basic water and sanitation services, a high burden of WASH-related deaths among children under five, and a high risk of climate and environmental hazards.  The other options are important social issues but are not the specific focus of the UNICEF report as described in the text.  This question tests comprehension and the ability to synthesize information from a specific report.



**8.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate credits earned through which of the following educational pathways?**

(a) Higher education only
(b) School education and higher education only
(c) School education, higher education, and vocational/skill education
(d) Vocational/skill education only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that NCrF aims to seamlessly integrate credits from school education, higher education, and vocational/skill education.  This is a key aspect of the framework's design to promote flexibility and mobility in learning.  The question tests conceptual understanding of the NCrF's objectives and design.


**9. The Kakori Train Action, a significant event in India's freedom struggle, was primarily led by whom?**

(a) Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev
(b)  Chandrashekhar Azad and Ram Prasad Bismil
(c) Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan
(d)  Rajguru and Shivram Rajguru

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly names Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan as the leaders of the Kakori Train Action.  While other revolutionaries were involved, these two are identified as the primary leaders in the given context.  The question tests factual recall of historical events and key figures associated with them.


**10.  Which of the following is NOT a relief provided under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005?**

(a)  Protection order
(b)  Custody of children
(c)  Imprisonment of the abuser
(d)  Monetary compensation

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The PWDVA, 2005, focuses on civil remedies and does not directly provide for the imprisonment of the abuser.  Imprisonment would fall under the purview of the Indian Penal Code or other criminal laws.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all mentioned as potential reliefs provided under the PWDVA.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the scope and limitations of a specific piece of legislation.


Here are some difficult UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues related to tribal welfare, vulnerable groups, and social justice.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India are concentrated in which state?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Andhra Pradesh
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The passage explicitly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, this question specifically asks about the concentration of PVTGs, a distinct category within the Scheduled Tribes. Chhattisgarh also has a significant PVTG population, sharing some groups with Madhya Pradesh, but Odisha holds the highest overall number. Andhra Pradesh, while having a substantial tribal population, is not mentioned as having a high concentration of PVTGs in the provided text.

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(c) The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d) The National Commission for Scheduled Castes Act, 1990

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly indicates that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the NCDNT's role is to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.  Options (a), (b), and (d) refer to different government initiatives and legal frameworks that address distinct social issues. While these are all important aspects of social welfare, they are not the primary function of the NCDNT.


**4. Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High level of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) A declining or stagnant population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage lists criteria for identifying PVTGs, and "low level of literacy" is explicitly mentioned.  Therefore, a "high level of literacy" would directly contradict the criteria for PVTG designation.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are all stated criteria for identifying PVTGs.


**5.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 mandates which of the following provisions regarding employment?**

(a) A minimum of 10% reservation in government jobs.
(b)  A minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs.
(c)  No reservation in private sector jobs.
(d)  Mandatory employment of at least one person with a disability in every organization.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage specifies that the RPwD Act, 2016, mandates "not less than 4% reservation in Government jobs" for persons with disabilities.  Option (a) is incorrect, as it overstates the mandated reservation percentage. Option (c) does not accurately reflect the law's application to government employment. Option (d) is incorrect as it does not mention any minimum number for employment of PwDs.


**6. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 makes it an offense to:**

(c)  Imposing alien values to accelerate modernization.
(d)  Centralized control over tribal administration and development.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage highlights the Panchsheel Principles, which explicitly emphasize respecting tribal rights to land and forests. Options (a), (c), and (d) contradict the fundamental principles of respecting tribal autonomy and cultural identity.


**8.  Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023?**

(a)  The World Bank
(b)  The National Statistical Office
(c)  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage directly states that the UNFPA, in collaboration with IIPS, released the India Ageing Report 2023. The other options are involved in related areas but are not specifically mentioned as the releasing body for this report.



**1.  Which entity is responsible for the preparation of a state-wise list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes (DNTs)?**

(a) The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)
(c) The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
(d) The Renke Commission

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is specifically tasked with preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes.  While the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment oversees the welfare of DNTs and has implemented various schemes for their upliftment, the NCDNT is the designated body for creating the state-wise caste list. The NHRC focuses on human rights violations, and the Renke Commission provided a report on nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, but neither is responsible for creating the state-wise caste list.  The NCDNT's role is crucial for accurate identification and targeted interventions for the DNT population, addressing their unique socio-economic challenges and historical injustices.  This targeted approach is essential for effective policy implementation and resource allocation for the DNT community.


**2.  Which of the following correctly describes the Hakki Pikki Tribe?**

(a) A Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) primarily residing in Odisha.
(b) A denotified tribe historically labelled as "born criminals."
(c) A semi-nomadic tribal group originating from Karnataka.
(d) A group primarily engaged in agricultural practices in Madhya Pradesh.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Hakki Pikki Tribe is explicitly identified in the provided text as a semi-nomadic tribal group hailing from Karnataka.  Option (a) is incorrect because the text specifies Odisha as having the highest number of PVTGs, and the Hakki Pikki are not mentioned in this context. Option (b) is incorrect as it describes Denotified Tribes, a different category.  Option (d) is incorrect because the Hakki Pikki's nomadic lifestyle contrasts with the agricultural focus described. Understanding the geographical distribution and lifestyle of various tribal groups is essential for effective policy-making and resource allocation, addressing the unique needs of these communities and promoting their welfare.


**3.  Which Indian state houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Bihar
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are mentioned as having some PVTGs, including the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes, the text explicitly designates Odisha as holding the largest number. This fact highlights the uneven distribution of PVTGs across India, underscoring the need for targeted interventions and development programs tailored to the specific needs of these vulnerable communities.  Understanding the distribution of PVTGs is crucial for effective policy design and resource allocation, ensuring that these marginalized groups receive the support they need to overcome their socio-economic challenges.


**4. What criteria are NOT used for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High level of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) Declining or stagnant population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly lists pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and declining/stagnant population as criteria for identifying PVTGs.  High literacy would contradict the characteristic of vulnerability these groups are identified by. Therefore, high literacy is NOT a criterion. This question tests factual recall regarding the specific characteristics used to define and identify PVTGs.  Understanding these criteria is crucial for accurately identifying and supporting these vulnerable groups, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively and that appropriate interventions are implemented to address their unique challenges.


**5. Which Act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(c) The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952.  The other acts listed address different aspects of social justice and human rights but are not directly related to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act. The repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act is a significant historical event, highlighting the ongoing struggle for social justice and the recognition of the rights of marginalized communities.  This question tests factual recall concerning a specific piece of legislation and its historical context.


**6. Which Ministry is responsible for the implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016?**

(a) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(c) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(d) Ministry of Education

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is responsible for the implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.  The other ministries listed have different areas of focus, making them incorrect options.  This question tests knowledge of governmental responsibilities and the allocation of resources for social welfare programs. Understanding which ministry oversees this Act is important for navigating the regulatory landscape and accessing relevant support services.


**7. Which of the following is NOT a type of nomadic community mentioned in the text?**

(a) Hunter/trappers of birds and animals
(b) Pastoral communities
(c) Peripatetic groups of peddlers
(d) Agricultural communities

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text specifically mentions hunter/gatherers, pastoral communities, and peripatetic groups of peddlers as types of nomadic communities.  Agricultural communities, by their nature, are settled and not nomadic.  This question assesses the ability to differentiate between different types of nomadic groups and their characteristics.  Understanding these different forms of nomadic lifestyles is important for creating effective policies for their welfare and integration into society.


**8.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 makes it an offense to:**

(a)  Employ people to clean sewers and septic tanks with appropriate protective gear.
(b)  Demolish insanitary latrines.
(c)  Construct sanitary latrines.
(d)  Employ people as manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Act explicitly prohibits the employment of individuals as manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines. Option (a) is incorrect because using protective gear is encouraged. Option (b) is incorrect because the Act mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines. Option (c) is also incorrect because the Act promotes the construction of sanitary latrines. This question tests knowledge of specific legal provisions and their implications for combating manual scavenging.  Understanding these provisions is crucial for effective law enforcement and the protection of human rights.


**9. Which scheme provides free competitive exam coaching to DNT students and health insurance to their families?**

(a)  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls
(b)  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme of construction of Hostels for DNTs Boys and Girls
(c)  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(d)  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is explicitly described as providing free competitive exam coaching and health insurance to DNT families. The other options describe different schemes focusing on education and housing for DNTs but not the combined benefits mentioned.  This question tests knowledge of specific government schemes and their provisions for the welfare of DNTs. Understanding these schemes is important for accessing available resources and promoting social inclusion.


**10.  Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023?**

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  World Food Programme (WFP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS). The other organizations mentioned focus on different areas of development and are therefore incorrect. This question tests knowledge of specific organizations and their publications related to population studies and demographic trends.  Understanding the source of such reports is crucial for accessing reliable data and informed policy-making.


**11. Which of the following is NOT a key target of the UNFPA by 2030?**

(a) Ending unmet need for family planning
(b) Ending preventable maternal death
(c) Ending gender-based violence and harmful practices
(d) Achieving universal primary education

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly lists ending unmet needs for family planning, ending preventable maternal deaths, and ending gender-based violence and harmful practices as key UNFPA targets by 2030. Achieving universal primary education is a broader Sustainable Development Goal, not specifically listed as a UNFPA target in this context.  This question tests understanding of the UNFPA's mandate and priorities.


**12. Which UN body monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child?**

(a)  UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(b)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(c)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The text explicitly states that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by its State parties.  The other UN bodies listed have different mandates and responsibilities.  This question tests knowledge of the UN system and the specific roles of different UN bodies.

(a) Anna University
(b) Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore
(c) IIT Bombay
(d) Jamia Millia Islamia

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text specifies that the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore topped the list of Indian Universities in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024, placing within the 201-250 bracket.  The other universities mentioned were also ranked but not at the top position among Indian institutions. This question tests knowledge of global university rankings and the performance of Indian institutions.

(c)  A Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) target of at least 50% by 2035
(d)  Mandatory single exit point for undergraduate degrees

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NEP 2020 features the establishment of MERUs, NRF, and a GER target of at least 50% by 2035.  However, it explicitly promotes *multiple* exit options for undergraduate degrees, not a mandatory single exit point. This question tests understanding of the NEP 2020's key features and potential misconceptions about its provisions.

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions that the National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023, aims to repeal the Dentists Act, 1948, and establish the National Dental Commission.  The other acts mentioned address different aspects of healthcare regulation.  This question tests knowledge of specific legislation related to healthcare regulation in India.


**19. What is the name of the mobile-based application used for dynamic identification of stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence among children and tracking of nutrition service delivery?**

(a)  CARINGS
(b)  Poshan Tracker
(c)  PENCiL
(d)  NDEAR

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly identifies "Poshan Tracker" as the mobile-based application used for dynamic identification of malnutrition and tracking nutrition service delivery.  The other options refer to different systems and portals. This question assesses knowledge of specific technology used in government programs.


**20.  Which country is mentioned as the first European country to grant paid menstrual leave to workers?**

(a)  India
(b)  Germany
(c)  Spain
(d)  United Kingdom

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that Spain is the first European country to grant paid menstrual leave to workers.  This question tests knowledge of global policy related to menstrual health and workplace rights.


**1.  Which initiative, launched under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and reduce mortality and malnutrition rates?**

(a)  National Rural Health Mission
(b)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(c)  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme is a flagship program of the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Its core objective is to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. This is achieved through a comprehensive approach encompassing supplementary nutrition, immunization, health check-ups, and pre-school education.  The other options, while relevant to healthcare in India, do not directly address the specific goals of improving the nutritional and health status of the target population group as comprehensively as the ICDS scheme. Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on health insurance, the National Rural Health Mission on rural healthcare infrastructure, and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana on health insurance coverage.  These initiatives play a supporting role but are not centrally focused on early childhood nutrition and development in the manner of ICDS.  The ICDS scheme, through its network of Anganwadi centers, provides a direct and sustained intervention at the grassroots level, making it the most appropriate answer.


**2.  Which organization, in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), released the India Ageing Report 2023, focusing on demographic trends and challenges associated with an aging population?**

(a)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The India Ageing Report 2023 was a collaborative effort between the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).  UNFPA's mandate directly aligns with population dynamics and reproductive health, making it the logical partner for such a report.  While WHO, UNDP, and UNICEF are all involved in various aspects of health and development, their primary focus does not encompass the specific area of population aging and its associated implications as directly as UNFPA.  The report's focus on demographic trends and the impact of an aging population on societal structures and resource allocation falls squarely within UNFPA's area of expertise.  Therefore, UNFPA is the most accurate answer.


**3.  Which Act, amended in 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all employments and restricts the employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations?**

(a)  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act
(b)  The Right to Education Act
(c)  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act
(d)  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, amended in 2016, is the primary legislation addressing child labour in India.  It sets the minimum age for employment at 14 years and prohibits the employment of children below this age in all types of work.  The Act further restricts the employment of adolescents (aged 14-18) in hazardous occupations and processes, protecting them from dangerous working conditions. While the other options address important aspects of children's rights and well-being, they do not directly focus on the prohibition and regulation of child labour. The Juvenile Justice Act deals with the care and protection of children in conflict with the law, the Right to Education Act guarantees free and compulsory education, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act focuses on protecting children from sexual abuse.  Therefore, the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act is the most relevant and accurate answer.


**4.  Which high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) deals with indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights?**

(a)  The UN Human Rights Council
(b)  The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(c)  The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(d)  The UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is a dedicated body established by ECOSOC to address the multifaceted challenges faced by indigenous populations globally.  Its mandate explicitly includes economic and social development, cultural preservation, environmental concerns, education, health, and human rights.  While the other options deal with related issues, they do not have the specific and comprehensive focus on indigenous issues that UNPFII possesses.  The UN Human Rights Council addresses a broader range of human rights issues, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights focuses on those specific rights, and the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples holds a more individual investigative role.  UNPFII, being a forum for discussion and policy recommendations on indigenous issues, is the most suitable answer.


**5.  Which government scheme, launched under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, aims to rehabilitate manual scavengers through alternative employment, financial assistance, and property acquisition support?**

(a)  National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM)
(b)  Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM)
(c)  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)
(d)  Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) is specifically designed to provide rehabilitation support to manual scavengers.  This includes training for alternative employment opportunities, financial assistance to establish small businesses, and aid in acquiring property.  While other schemes like NRLM, DAY-NRLM, and MGNREGA address poverty alleviation and rural employment, they do not have the targeted focus on the specific needs and vulnerabilities of manual scavengers as SRMS does.  The SRMS scheme directly addresses the challenge of providing sustainable livelihoods and social inclusion for this marginalized community.  Therefore, SRMS is the most accurate answer.


**6. Which organization released the ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report,’ highlighting the global scale of forced displacement due to conflict, persecution, and violence?**

(a)  International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b)  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
(c)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d)  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the lead UN agency mandated to protect refugees and forcibly displaced people worldwide. The "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" is a flagship publication of UNHCR, providing comprehensive data and analysis on global displacement patterns. While the IOM, OHCHR, and ICRC also work on migration and humanitarian issues, UNHCR's specific mandate and expertise in refugee protection make it the primary source for this type of report. The report's detailed statistics on refugee populations, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons are directly relevant to UNHCR's core functions.  Therefore, UNHCR is the most accurate and appropriate answer.


**7. Which act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, which had wrongly labeled certain communities as "born criminals"?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act
(b) The Protection of Human Rights Act
(c) The Habitual Offenders Act
(d) The National Commission for Scheduled Castes Act

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, repealed the discriminatory Criminal Tribes Act of 1871. The Criminal Tribes Act unjustly labeled entire communities as criminal by birth, leading to systemic oppression and marginalization.  The Habitual Offenders Act aimed to rectify this historical injustice and remove the stigma associated with the earlier legislation. While other Acts address various aspects of social justice and human rights, they do not directly relate to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act deals with atrocities against SCs and STs, the Protection of Human Rights Act establishes the National Human Rights Commission, and the National Commission for Scheduled Castes Act establishes the commission to address issues faced by Scheduled Castes. Therefore, the Habitual Offenders Act is the only legislation directly relevant to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.


**8. Which committee, chaired by Dr. K. Radhakrishnan, proposed reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions, including a transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited)?**

(a) The Yashpal Committee
(b) The Kothari Commission
(c) The National Education Policy Committee
(d) The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee was specifically tasked with reviewing and reforming the accreditation process for Higher Educational Institutions in India. Its recommendations included a shift to a binary accreditation system, simplifying the assessment process and enhancing transparency.  The other options, while influential in education policy, did not directly address accreditation reforms as the primary focus of their work. The Yashpal Committee focused on higher education reforms, the Kothari Commission on education policy broadly, and the National Education Policy Committee on framing the NEP.  Therefore, the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee is the most appropriate answer, as its mandate directly addressed the question's subject matter.


**9. Which institution, established in 1975, is a major research center of the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR) and works in over 60 countries, including India, to provide research-based policy solutions for reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition?**

(a)  The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
(b)  The World Food Programme (WFP)
(c)  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) precisely fits the description provided.  It is a leading research institution focused on food security, poverty reduction, and nutrition improvement, working extensively across many countries, including India.  While the FAO, WFP, and IFAD also contribute to food security and agricultural development, IFPRI's core function is research-based policy analysis and recommendations, aligning directly with the description given.  The other organizations have broader mandates or operational roles, whereas IFPRI's work is specifically geared towards providing policy-relevant research findings. Therefore, IFPRI is the most accurate answer.


**10. Which index, released annually by the World Economic Forum, measures gender equality across four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment?**

(a)  The Gender Inequality Index (GII)
(b)  The Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI)
(c)  The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)
(d)  The Human Development Index (HDI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) is the World Economic Forum's annual publication that measures gender disparities across various dimensions including economic participation, education, health, and political empowerment.  The GII, GSNI, and HDI address related issues but do not have the same specific focus on gender equality across these four parameters as the GGGI.  The GGGI provides a comparative assessment of gender parity across countries, making it a valuable tool for understanding global trends and policy implications.  The report's detailed methodology and data are specifically designed to measure gender gaps in these four key areas. Therefore, the Global Gender Gap Index is the most accurate answer.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced a significant change regarding the use of donor gametes in surrogacy.  Which of the following accurately reflects this change?**

(a) Donor gametes are now completely prohibited in all surrogacy procedures.
(b) Donor gametes are permitted only if the intending couple provides at least one gamete.
(c) Donor gametes are permitted only for single women (widows or divorcees) undergoing surrogacy.
(d) The rules regarding donor gametes remain unchanged from the 2022 rules.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The 2024 amendment allows surrogacy using donor gametes *only* if at least one gamete (egg or sperm) originates from the intending couple. This addresses the medical needs of couples facing infertility while maintaining a degree of genetic connection to the child. Option (a) is incorrect because the rules don't completely prohibit donor gametes; they simply restrict their use. Option (c) is partially correct regarding single women using donor sperm but is not the complete picture of the amendment. Option (d) is false, as the rules were explicitly amended.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of legal nuances.


**2.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA) defines domestic violence broadly. Which of the following is NOT explicitly included in its definition?**

(a) Physical abuse.
(b) Verbal abuse.
(c) Financial abuse.
(d) Neglect of children within the household.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** While the PWDVA aims to protect children within the household from the effects of domestic violence, the *definition* of domestic violence itself focuses on the abuse inflicted on the woman. Neglect of children is a separate issue, although it may be a consequence of domestic violence and would likely be considered in determining relief under the Act.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all explicitly included in the act's definition of domestic violence. This question tests the ability to distinguish between related but distinct concepts and demonstrates an understanding of the Act's scope.


**3. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) recently issued guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offenses under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.  Which of the following statements about these guidelines is most likely to be true, given the context of the Act?**

(a) The guidelines mandate that all children accused of heinous crimes be tried as adults.
(b) The guidelines focus solely on the age of the child suspect, with no consideration for the nature of the crime.
(c) The guidelines provide a framework for determining whether a child should be tried as an adult or juvenile, considering factors beyond age.
(d) The guidelines eliminate the provision for trying children aged 16-18 as adults for heinous offenses.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Juvenile Justice Act allows for children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults in heinous cases, but this is subject to assessment.  The NCPCR guidelines would likely provide a structured approach to this assessment, considering factors beyond just the child's age, such as the severity of the crime, the child's maturity level, and the possibility of rehabilitation. Options (a) and (b) are oversimplifications of the complex legal framework. Option (d) is incorrect because it would contradict the existing provisions of the Act.  This question assesses conceptual understanding and application of legal frameworks.


**4.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate various educational pathways in India. Which of the following best describes its primary goal?**

(a) To standardize all educational curricula across schools, higher education, and vocational training.
(b) To create a system where credits earned in different educational settings are seamlessly transferable and recognized.
(c) To eliminate vocational training programs and focus solely on traditional academic education.
(d) To establish a single national examination for all levels of education.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCrF’s core objective is to create a flexible system that allows students to accumulate and transfer credits earned through various modes of learning, such as school, higher education, and vocational training. This promotes flexibility and mobility between different educational paths. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the NCrF's purpose.  This question tests conceptual understanding and the ability to synthesize information about educational policy.


**5. According to the provided text, which of the following organizations is responsible for accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) in compliance with the Paris Principles?**

(a) The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)
(b) The National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC)
(c) The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d) The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that GANHRI is responsible for reviewing and accrediting NHRIs based on the Paris Principles. The other options are involved in human rights work but do not have the specific accreditation function described.  This question tests factual recall of organizations and their mandates.


**6. The "Prayatna" project, highlighted in a NITI Aayog report, focuses on which specific vulnerable group in India?**

(a) Children from marginalized communities.
(b) Persons with disabilities.
(c) The transgender community.
(d) Individuals affected by manual scavenging.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Prayatna project targets the transgender community, providing livelihood and entrepreneurship training. The other options are also areas of concern, but not the specific focus of this project. This question tests factual recall of specific programs and their target beneficiaries.


**7.  The  "ODF Plus" status for villages in India, as described in the text, goes beyond simply eliminating open defecation. What additional key component is crucial for achieving this advanced status?**

(a)  The construction of new schools and hospitals.
(b)  The implementation of solid and/or liquid waste management systems.
(c)  The establishment of new industries in the village.
(d)  The increase in the number of tourists visiting the village.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text defines ODF Plus as including the sustained ODF status *along with* the implementation of either solid or liquid waste management systems.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are not directly related to the definition of ODF Plus. This question tests the ability to understand and apply definitions from the text.


**8. The  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates reservation for PwDs in various sectors.  In which of the following sectors is this reservation NOT applicable?**

(a) Government jobs.
(b) Government-aided higher educational institutions.
(c) Police forces (including Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT police).
(d) Private sector companies.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the reservation under the RPwD Act does *not* apply to police forces.  Reservations are mandated for government jobs and government-aided higher educational institutions. The private sector is not covered by this specific legislation. This question tests the ability to accurately recall specific provisions of a law.


**9. The  Global Hunger Index (GHI) uses several indicators to assess hunger levels.  Which of the following is NOT a primary indicator used in the GHI calculation, according to the text?**

(a) Undernourishment.
(b) Child stunting.
(c) Child wasting.
(d) Literacy rate.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text lists undernourishment, child stunting, and child wasting as primary indicators used in the GHI.  Literacy rate, while related to overall development, is not a core component of the GHI's hunger assessment. This question tests the ability to identify key components of a specific index.


**10.  Which of the following Acts prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in *all* types of employment?**

(a) The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956
(b) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976
(c) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(d) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, specifically prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all employment. The other acts address different aspects of child exploitation but don't have this broad prohibition on child labor.  This question tests factual recall of specific legislation related to child protection.



Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  Each question is designed to test specific knowledge and avoid ambiguity.


**1.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects the current status of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a)  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of recognized PVTGs.
(b)  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-industrial levels of technology and high literacy rates.
(c)  Odisha currently houses the largest number of PVTGs.
(d)  PVTGs were initially recognized in 2006 as Primitive Tribal Groups.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, Odisha houses the highest number of recognized PVTGs (13). Option (a) is incorrect because it conflates the overall ST population with PVTG numbers. Option (b) is incorrect; the criteria for PVTG identification include *low* literacy rates, not high. Option (d) is incorrect because PVTGs were initially identified in 1973 as PTGs, later renamed in 2006. The nuanced distinction between overall ST populations and the specific categorization of PVTGs, along with the historical evolution of the term, makes this a difficult question requiring precise knowledge.


**2. The  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) primarily aims to:**

(a)  Provide financial assistance to all nomadic communities in India.
(b)  Develop and implement a comprehensive rehabilitation program for manual scavengers.
(c)  Prepare a nationwide list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes.
(d)  Oversee the implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006 for all tribal groups.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) correctly identifies the NCDNT's primary mandate. The commission focuses on creating a comprehensive, state-wise list of DNTs.  Option (a) is too broad; the NCDNT's focus isn't solely on financial aid, but also on broader welfare and development. Option (b) is incorrect as manual scavenging falls under a different legal and administrative framework. Option (d) is incorrect as the Forest Rights Act is separate legislation dealing with tribal land rights.  This question demands a clear understanding of the specific responsibilities of the NCDNT within the larger context of tribal welfare.


**3.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b)  High level of literacy
(c)  Economic backwardness
(d)  A declining or stagnant population


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer.  PVTGs are identified based on their low level of literacy, not high. Options (a), (c), and (d) are all accurate criteria used to define PVTGs. This question tests detailed knowledge of the specific selection criteria for PVTGs, distinguishing them from other tribal groups.


**4. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates which of the following?**

(a)  A minimum of 10% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.
(b)  Reservation for PwDs is applicable to all police forces in India.
(c)  Recognition of 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
(d)  Free education for children with disabilities is only available in special schools.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The RPwD Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities. Option (a) is incorrect; the mandated reservation is 4%, not 10%. Option (b) is incorrect; the reservation does *not* apply to police forces. Option (d) is incorrect; free education is available in neighborhood schools as well. This question tests knowledge of specific provisions within the RPwD Act, requiring accurate recall of percentages and exemptions.


**5.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) makes it an offense to:**

(a)  Employ individuals to clean sewers with appropriate protective gear.
(b)  Convert insanitary latrines into sanitary latrines.
(c)  Construct new sanitary latrines in urban areas.
(d)  Employ people to clean sewers and septic tanks without protective gear.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct; the PEMSR Act criminalizes employing individuals for such work without proper safety equipment. Option (a) is incorrect; employing people with protective gear is *not* an offense. Option (b) is incorrect; converting insanitary latrines is a mandated action under the Act. Option (c) is incorrect; constructing sanitary latrines is encouraged, not prohibited. This question focuses on the specific legal prohibitions within the PEMSR Act, requiring an understanding of the nuances of its provisions.


**6. Which statement about the  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) is accurate?**

(a) It primarily focuses on rote learning and memorization.
(b) It completely ignores the inclusion of vocational skills in the curriculum.
(c) It advocates for a holistic approach to education, integrating various disciplines.
(d) It proposes a reduction in the overall learning hours for students.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The NCF-SE emphasizes a holistic approach, integrating diverse subjects. Option (a) is incorrect; it promotes experiential learning. Option (b) is incorrect; it includes vocational skills. Option (d) is incorrect; it doesn't propose a reduction in learning hours. This question assesses understanding of the core philosophy and goals of the NCF-SE.


**7.  The  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) primarily aims to:**

(a) Provide financial loans to students pursuing higher education.
(b) Digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions.
(c)  Establish a national ranking system for higher educational institutions.
(d)  Regulate the fees charged by private universities in India.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer; ABC is designed for digital storage of academic credits. Option (a) is incorrect; it's not a lending institution. Option (c) is incorrect; it's not involved in university rankings. Option (d) is incorrect; it doesn't regulate university fees.  This question requires knowledge of the specific function of the ABC within the education system.


**8. Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023?**

(a)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in collaboration with International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
(d)  National Family Health Survey (NFHS)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) correctly identifies UNFPA and IIPS as the joint releasers of the report.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are involved in health and population-related data but did not release this specific report.  This question tests factual recall regarding the source of a specific publication.


**9. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 categorizes India as:**

(a) Low
(b) Moderate
(c) Serious
(d) Alarming


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct; the GHI 2023 placed India in the "Serious" category.  The other options represent different levels of hunger severity on the GHI scale. This question tests direct recall of the GHI categorization for India.


**10. Which of the following is NOT a key parameter in the Global Gender Gap Index?**

(a) Economic Participation and Opportunity
(b) Educational Attainment
(c)  Environmental Sustainability
(d) Political Empowerment


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  Environmental sustainability is not a parameter in the Global Gender Gap Index. The other options are core components of the index. This question tests knowledge of the specific components of a global index.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assesses various cognitive skills, primarily factual recall and conceptual understanding.  The questions avoid direct replication of the source material and use varied phrasing to test deeper comprehension.


**1.  A government initiative aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers while simultaneously reducing mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition rates.  This initiative is primarily associated with which of the following?**

(a) Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(c) Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(d) National Family Health Survey


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 program, an integral part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme, directly addresses the goals outlined in the question. Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on broader healthcare, Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets immunization, and the National Family Health Survey is a data collection initiative, not a direct service provider.  The description of the program's aims precisely matches the objectives of Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, making it the only suitable answer.  Other options, while relevant to overall health and well-being, do not directly match the specific goals stated in the question.


**2.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for a significant restructuring of the school education system in India. Which of the following is NOT a core element of this restructuring as described in the provided information?**

(a)  A shift to a 5+3+3+4 age-based schooling structure.
(b)  The introduction of a binary accreditation system for schools.
(c)  Emphasis on multilingualism, promoting proficiency in at least three languages.
(d)  Integration of contributions from Indian history across various disciplines into the curriculum.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE focuses on a new age-based structure, multilingualism, and incorporating Indian historical contributions.  However, the text does not mention the introduction of a binary accreditation system *for schools*.  While the text discusses accreditation for Higher Education Institutions, this is distinct from the school system's restructuring under the NCF-SE.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are all explicitly mentioned as key aspects of the NCF-SE's restructuring efforts.  The absence of any mention of a binary accreditation system for schools makes (b) the correct answer.


**3. Which organization released a report highlighting the global rise in food insecurity between 2020 and 2022, attributing the increase to overlapping crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical conflicts?**

(a)  UNHCR
(b)  UNFPA
(c)  IFPRI
(d)  WFP


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is explicitly identified as the source of the report described in the question.  The UNHCR focuses on refugees, UNFPA on population issues, and the WFP on food aid; none of these organizations' mandates directly align with the report's focus on global food policy and the analysis of multifaceted crises impacting food security.  Therefore, only IFPRI accurately corresponds to the described report and its findings.


**4.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates specific reservations for individuals with disabilities in various sectors.  Which of the following sectors is specifically EXCLUDED from these reservation provisions?**

(a)  Government-aided higher educational institutions
(b)  Government jobs
(c)  Police forces (including Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, and Delhi/UT police)
(d)  Private sector employment


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text clearly states that the reservation provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016, do *not* apply to police forces.  Reservations are mandated for government-aided higher education and government jobs. The act does not explicitly address the private sector, though it may indirectly influence practices there.  The explicit exclusion of police forces from the reservation policy is the key differentiating factor, making (c) the correct answer.


**5. Which of the following best describes the primary mandate of the National Credit Framework (NCrF)?**

(a)  To standardize the evaluation of higher education institutions.
(b)  To establish a uniform system for vocational training accreditation.
(c)  To create a unified credit system integrating learning across school, higher education, and vocational sectors.
(d)  To develop a national assessment center for evaluating student performance.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF's core purpose is to create a single, integrated framework for accumulating and transferring credits earned through various educational pathways.  Options (a) and (b) are too narrow, focusing only on specific aspects of education. Option (d) describes a different initiative (PARAKH).  The comprehensive integration of credits across different educational systems is the unique and central function of the NCrF, making (c) the correct answer.


**6.  The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) plays a crucial role in the international human rights landscape. Which of the following is a core function of GANHRI?**

(a)  Directly investigating human rights violations globally.
(b)  Developing and implementing international human rights laws.
(c)  Reviewing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on international standards.
(d)  Providing direct legal representation for victims of human rights abuses.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** GANHRI's primary function is the accreditation of NHRIs based on the Paris Principles.  Options (a), (b), and (d) describe actions undertaken by other international bodies or national institutions, not core functions of GANHRI itself.  GANHRI's role as a reviewer and accreditor of NHRIs based on established international standards is uniquely its own.


**7. The "triple threat" as defined by UNICEF in relation to WASH services for children, encompasses which three factors?**

(a)  High rates of waterborne diseases, inadequate sanitation facilities, and limited access to clean water.
(b)  Low access to basic water or sanitation, high child mortality due to unsafe WASH conditions, and high risk from climate and environmental hazards.
(c)  Lack of hygiene education, insufficient funding for WASH infrastructure, and weak governance related to WASH programs.
(d)  Inadequate water quality monitoring, insufficient sanitation coverage in schools, and limited access to hygiene products.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The text explicitly defines the "triple threat" as encompassing low access to basic water or sanitation, a high burden of WASH-related child mortality, and a high risk from climate and environmental hazards. The other options, while related to WASH challenges, do not precisely match UNICEF's definition of the "triple threat."

(b) To improve sanitation facilities in urban slums.
(c) To sustain Open Defecation Free (ODF) status and implement solid and/or liquid waste management systems.
(d) To promote hygiene education and awareness campaigns in villages.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly defines ODF Plus as building upon the achievement of ODF status by adding the implementation of solid and/or liquid waste management systems.  The other options, while relevant to broader sanitation goals, do not accurately capture the core objective of the ODF Plus initiative.


**10.  The  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education systems in India utilizes data from which two primary sources?**

(a)  National Sample Survey (NSS) and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)
(b)  Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the District Information System for Education (DISE)
(c)  Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS)
(d)  National Achievement Survey (NAS) and the National Education Policy (NEP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions that the PGI uses data from UDISE+ and NAS.  The other options list different data sources not mentioned in the text.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.


**1.  The Hakki Pikki Tribe, known for their semi-nomadic lifestyle and diverse occupations, primarily resides in which Indian state?**

(a) Rajasthan
(b) Odisha
(c) Madhya Pradesh
(d) Karnataka

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Hakki Pikki Tribe is a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka.  Rajasthan is known for different tribal groups, Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs, and Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of STs overall. These facts are mentioned in the text, but they are not directly related to the Hakki Pikki Tribe.  Therefore, Karnataka is the only accurate answer.  Understanding the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups is crucial for understanding the complexities of India's social fabric and the challenges faced by these communities in accessing resources and government support.


**2.  Which government ministry is the nodal authority for implementing policies and programs related to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Home Affairs

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly designates the Ministry of Tribal Affairs as the nodal ministry for PVTGs. While other ministries may have overlapping responsibilities concerning tribal welfare, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs holds the primary responsibility for formulating and implementing targeted policies and programs for these particularly vulnerable groups.  Understanding the roles and responsibilities of different government ministries is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of governance and policy implementation in addressing social issues.  This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of India's administrative structure.


**3. Which commission's recommendations led to the initial recognition of Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973, later renamed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Mandal Commission
(b) Renke Commission
(c) Idate Commission
(d) UNDhebar Commission

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the PTGs (later PVTGs) were first recognized in 1973 based on the recommendations of the UNDhebar Commission (1961). The Mandal Commission focused on Other Backward Classes (OBCs), the Renke Commission addressed nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, and the Idate Commission is related to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs). This question tests factual recall of specific commissions and their contributions to India's social policy.  Understanding the historical context of policies is crucial for appreciating their evolution and limitations.


**4.  Which state in India currently houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Karnataka
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The text clearly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of STs overall, and Chhattisgarh shares some PVTGs with Madhya Pradesh, Odisha holds the distinction of having the largest concentration of PVTGs. This question assesses factual recall of specific data related to the geographical distribution of vulnerable populations.  Understanding this distribution is crucial for targeted interventions and resource allocation.


**5. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is primarily tasked with which of the following functions?**

(a) Implementing rehabilitation schemes for manual scavengers.
(b) Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
(c) Monitoring the implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006.
(d) Providing scholarships to students from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage specifically mentions that the NCDNT is responsible for preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.  Options (a), (c), and (d) relate to different social welfare schemes and initiatives but not to the primary function of the NCDNT.  This question tests the understanding of the organizational structure and mandates within India's social welfare system.


**6.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates a minimum reservation percentage for PwDs in which of the following sectors?**

(a) Private sector employment
(b) Government jobs and government-aided higher educational institutions
(c) Judiciary and the legal profession
(d)  Police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and not less than 5% reservation in government/government-aided higher educational institutions.  The Act does not explicitly mandate reservations in the private sector, the judiciary, or police forces. This question tests knowledge of specific legal provisions and their implications for social inclusion.


**7. Which Act prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all employment in India?**

(a) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(b) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(c) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(d) The Right to Education Act, 2009

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, explicitly prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all forms of employment. The other acts address different aspects of child welfare, domestic violence, and education but do not directly address the issue of child labour in this comprehensive manner. This question tests knowledge of specific legislation and its impact on child rights.


**8.  The National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme is a joint initiative of which two ministries?**

(d) 3+3+4+4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly indicates that the NCF-SE is based on the 5+3+3+4 age-based framework for schooling.  This framework is a key component of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.  This question assesses understanding of recent educational reforms and their structural implications.


**1.  Which entity released the report titled ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report,’ highlighting a 21% increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises compared to 2021?**

(a) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(b) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(d) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the correct answer.  The UNHCR is a specialized agency of the United Nations dedicated to protecting refugees, forcibly displaced communities, and stateless people.  Their mandate includes monitoring global displacement trends and publishing reports on the subject. The provided text explicitly states that the UNHCR released the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" and highlights the key finding of a 21% increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises.  The other options are incorrect as they represent different organizations with different focuses. IFPRI focuses on food security, UNDESA on broader economic and social development, and GANHRI on human rights.  These organizations may release reports on related issues, but not the specific report mentioned in the question.


**2.  Which organization, established in 1971, is a global partnership engaged in research for a food-secured future and is associated with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR) is the correct answer. The provided text clearly states that IFPRI, a major research center, was established in 1975 and is a part of CGIAR, which is described as a global partnership established in 1971, focused on research for a food-secured future.  The World Food Programme (WFP) is a separate UN agency focused on food aid and relief. UNFPA focuses on population issues, and UNDESA on broader economic and social development. None of these organizations directly fulfills the description of a global partnership established in 1971 and associated with IFPRI as described in the provided text.


**3.  According to the provided text, which Indian University was ranked within the 201-250 bracket in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024, topping the list of Indian Universities in that ranking?**

**Explanation:** The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore is the correct answer. The text explicitly mentions that IISc Bangalore was placed in the 201-250 bracket and topped the list of Indian Universities in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024.  The other options, Anna University, Jamia Millia Islamia, and Mahatma Gandhi University, were also mentioned as being ranked within the 501-600 bracket, indicating lower rankings compared to IISc Bangalore.  Therefore, only IISc Bangalore satisfies the conditions specified in the question.

The other options, UNCPD, UNCRC, and WFP, are involved in different aspects of international development, but the specific report mentioned is attributed to UNDESA.  The question specifically asks about the organization that released this particular report, making the other options incorrect.


**5. Which act, repealed in 1952, led to the categorization of certain communities as “born criminals” during the British regime and is relevant to the discussion of Denotified Tribes (DNTs)?**

(a)  Habitual Offenders Act
(b)  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act
(c)  Criminal Tribes Act
(d)  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 is the correct answer. The text explains that Denotified Tribes were originally "notified" as "born criminals" under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, during the British Raj.  This act was later repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.  The other options are irrelevant to the historical context of DNTs' categorization. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act and the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act address different social issues.  Therefore, only the Criminal Tribes Act accurately addresses the historical context described in the question.


**6. Which committee, chaired by Prof. K. Kasturirangan, was responsible for creating a curriculum aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, leading to the release of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)?**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and focuses on specific details within the text, avoiding ambiguity and obvious answers.

**1.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for a significant restructuring of the school education system. Which of the following is NOT a key feature of this restructuring as proposed by the NCF-SE?**

(a) A shift to a semester-based academic calendar instead of the traditional annual system.
(b) The introduction of a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
(c)  Mandatory inclusion of at least four Indian languages in the curriculum for all students.
(d)  Flexibility and choice at the secondary level, blurring the lines between academic and vocational subjects.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE indeed proposes a move to a semester system (a), a new 5+3+3+4 age-based schooling structure (b), and flexibility in subject choices at the secondary level (d). However, the framework suggests proficiency in at least *three* languages, with at least two being Indian languages, not four (c).  The emphasis is on multilingualism, promoting students' native languages alongside a national language and a third language, often English, for wider communication.  The option (c) introduces a misleading element by exaggerating the language requirement, making it a strong distractor and highlighting the need for precise factual recall.  The NCF-SE's focus on multilingualism is crucial for understanding its approach to education in a diverse nation like India.  The other options accurately reflect the proposed changes, highlighting the framework's intention to create a more flexible and adaptable educational system.


**2.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education assesses the performance of the school education system at both state and district levels. Based on the provided information, which of the following statements regarding the PGI 2.0 (2021-22) is accurate?**

(a)  All states and union territories achieved at least the "Uttam" grade in PGI 2.0.
(b)  The PGI 2.0 index showed a significant increase in the disparity between the highest and lowest performing states/UTs compared to the 2017-18 assessment.
(c)  Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in PGI 2.0.
(d)  No state or union territory achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in the PGI 2.0 assessment.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PGI 2.0 report explicitly states that none of the states or union territories reached the highest grade, "Daksh" (d). Option (a) is incorrect because the report clearly indicates a range of grades, with some states/UTs performing significantly lower than others. Option (b) is false; the report highlights a *reduction* in the deviation between the highest and lowest scores, indicating improved equity in performance. Option (c) is incorrect; Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram were placed in the lowest grade, "Akanshi-3," not the highest. The question tests factual recall and the ability to interpret data presented in the text, emphasizing the importance of understanding the nuances of educational performance assessment in India.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options, like (a) and (b), adds to the question's difficulty.


**3. Which of the following is NOT a key feature of the National Credit Framework (NCrF)?**

(a) Seamless integration of credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education.
(b)  A system categorizing education into eight levels, with levels 1-4 representing school education.
(c) The mandatory inclusion of experiential learning, such as industrial experience, for credit accumulation.
(d)  A rigid structure with limited entry and exit points, emphasizing a linear progression through education.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF aims to create a flexible and integrated credit system (a) and uses an eight-level structure (b). It also incorporates experiential learning (c) to make the system more comprehensive.  However, the framework explicitly promotes *multiple entry and exit options* (contrary to option (d)), allowing for lifelong learning and flexibility in educational pathways. This makes option (d) the incorrect answer, highlighting the core principle of the NCrF, which is to enable individuals to tailor their educational journey according to their needs and aspirations. The question requires a nuanced understanding of the NCrF's design and its departure from traditional, rigid educational structures. The distractors are carefully chosen to represent aspects that are *partially* true but ultimately do not represent the complete picture of the NCrF's flexibility.


**4. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, established a new organization to guide and support research and innovation in India.  Which of the following individuals is NOT an ex-officio member of the NRF's Governing Board?**

(a) The Prime Minister of India
(b) The Union Minister of Science & Technology
(c) The Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India
(d) The Chief Justice of India

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Act explicitly lists the Prime Minister (a), the Union Minister of Science & Technology, and the Union Minister of Education (b) as ex-officio members of the Governing Board. The Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India (c) serves as the Member Secretary. The Chief Justice of India (d), however, does not hold an ex-officio position on this board.  This question directly tests factual recall and understanding of the organizational structure of the NRF. The inclusion of the Principal Scientific Advisor as a plausible distractor (as they hold a key position within the NRF structure) adds to the question's difficulty.  The question requires attention to specific details within the text description of the NRF's governance structure.


**5. The recently released UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, introduced several changes to the process of granting Deemed-to-be University status. Which of the following changes is NOT included in these new regulations?**

(a) Institutions less than 20 years old can now apply for Deemed-to-be University status.
(b)  A cluster of institutions under different sponsoring bodies can jointly apply for Deemed-to-be University status.
(c)  Institutions granted Deemed-to-be University status are required to establish an Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identity for their students.
(d)  Institutions must obtain prior approval from the President of India before starting any new courses or programs.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The new regulations allow institutions younger than 20 years to apply (a), permit joint applications from clusters of institutions (b), and mandate the creation of ABC identities for students (c).  However, the regulations state that approval for new courses or programs comes from the institution's Executive Council and relevant statutory councils, not the President of India (d). This question tests the understanding of policy changes and the ability to identify specific alterations within a regulatory framework. The inclusion of (d) as a distractor plays on the hierarchical nature of Indian governance and the potential for misunderstanding the decision-making process within the higher education system.  The question also requires careful reading and attention to detail to correctly identify the incorrect option.


**6.  According to the information provided, which of the following statements about the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 is INCORRECT?**

(a)  The GHI is jointly released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.
(b)  India's GHI score in 2023 showed a slight improvement compared to its 2015 score.
(c)  The report categorized India as having "serious" levels of hunger.
(d)  The GHI report was universally accepted by the Indian government without any objections raised.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text correctly identifies the organizations releasing the GHI (a), notes a slight improvement in India's score (b), and confirms India's categorization as having "serious" hunger levels (c).  However, the Indian government *did* raise objections to the methodology and data used in the GHI report (d), making this statement incorrect. This question tests factual recall and awareness of controversies surrounding international indices. The inclusion of (d) as the incorrect option highlights the importance of understanding the context surrounding such reports and the differing perspectives on their interpretations.  The question demands careful reading to identify the subtle but crucial difference in the statement (d).


**7. The  "Triple Threat Report" released by UNICEF highlights a significant challenge to children's well-being. Which of the following is NOT a component of this "triple threat" as defined in the report?**

(a)  Less than 50% access to at least basic water or sanitation services.
(b)  High rates of child mortality among the top 20 countries with the highest burden of deaths attributable to unsafe WASH.
(c)  Ranking among the top 25% of countries facing the highest risk of climate and environmental hazards in UNICEF's Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI).
(d)  High levels of adult illiteracy in countries with poor WASH infrastructure.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The "triple threat" specifically focuses on access to WASH services (a), the burden of WASH-related deaths (b), and climate risk (c). Adult illiteracy (d), while a significant concern, is not explicitly defined as part of this specific "triple threat" framework. This question requires careful reading to identify the specific components of the defined "triple threat." The inclusion of (d) as a distractor tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between related but distinct concepts within the context of child well-being. The question highlights the need for precise understanding of the specific terminology and definitions used in international development reports.


**8.  With reference to the  National Medical Commission (NMC) and its recent recognition by the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME), which statement is NOT true?**

(a) The WFME grants recognition status to accrediting agencies meeting its criteria.
(b) The NMC is a statutory body under the NMC Act, 2019.
(c)  The WFME accreditation automatically covers all existing and newly established medical colleges in India for the next 20 years.
(d) The NMC's WFME recognition is intended to improve the quality of medical education in India.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The WFME indeed accredits agencies (a), and the NMC is a statutory body (b).  The recognition is also aimed at improving education quality (d). However, the WFME accreditation for the NMC covers existing colleges and *new* colleges for the next *10 years*, not 20 (c).  This question tests factual precision and knowledge of recent developments in medical education regulation in India. The inclusion of (c) as the incorrect option highlights the importance of paying close attention to numerical details within policy announcements and reports.  The question demonstrates the significance of detailed factual recall and careful reading comprehension for accurate interpretation of information related to policy changes.


**9.  The  "India Ageing Report 2023" was released by which organization?**

(a) The World Bank
(b) The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
(c) The World Health Organization (WHO)
(d) The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the UNFPA, in collaboration with IIPS, released the report (b). The other options are incorrect. This question tests factual recall about the source of a specific report relevant to demographic trends. The inclusion of other organizations involved in similar demographic studies as distractors (a, c, d) adds to the challenge. The question highlights the importance of correctly identifying the originating source of information within the context of demographic and social development studies.


**10.  Which of the following statements regarding the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) and ODF Plus status is INCORRECT?**

(a)  ODF Plus status requires sustained ODF status alongside the implementation of solid or liquid waste management systems.
(b)  An ODF Plus Model village must demonstrate visual cleanliness, including minimal litter and stagnant wastewater.
(c)  By September 2023, 75% of Indian villages had achieved ODF Plus status.
(d)  ODF Plus status requires the establishment of a dedicated waste management facility in each village.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Options (a), (b), and (c) accurately reflect the criteria and progress of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen). However, (d) is incorrect.  While ODF Plus status encourages waste management, it doesn't mandate a *separate* facility in each village. The implementation of waste management systems can be achieved through various methods, not necessarily requiring a dedicated facility in every village. This question tests the understanding of government programs and their implementation details.  The inclusion of (d) as the incorrect option highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of policy implementation and not making generalizations based on superficial understanding.  The question emphasizes the need for precise understanding of the criteria associated with ODF Plus status.


**1.  Which statement accurately reflects the categorization of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) PVTGs are exclusively found in pre-agricultural societies.
(b)  All Scheduled Tribes (STs) are designated as PVTGs.
(c) The criteria for PVTG identification include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
(d) Odisha has the lowest number of PVTGs in India.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) correctly identifies the key criteria used to determine PVTG status.  While PVTGs often exhibit pre-agricultural levels of technology and face economic backwardness, these are not exclusive criteria.  Many PVTGs have transitioned to some level of agriculture or other economic activities.  Option (b) is incorrect because PVTGs represent a subset of Scheduled Tribes; not all STs are classified as PVTGs. Option (a) is too restrictive, as it ignores the fact that some PVTGs may have adopted some agricultural practices. Option (d) is factually incorrect; Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  The definition and identification criteria for PVTGs are crucial for understanding the unique challenges faced by these groups and for targeted policy interventions aimed at their upliftment.  Understanding the nuances of PVTG classification is vital for effective tribal welfare programs.


**2.  The Hakki Pikki tribe, known for their semi-nomadic lifestyle, primarily resides in which Indian state?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Karnataka


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Hakki Pikki tribe is specifically mentioned in the provided text as a semi-nomadic group residing in Karnataka.  The other options (Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha) are incorrect as they are not the primary location of the Hakki Pikki tribe. The question tests factual recall regarding the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups within India.  Understanding the location of various tribal communities is essential for implementing targeted development and welfare programs.  The correct identification of the Hakki Pikki tribe's location highlights the importance of geographically specific interventions in addressing the unique challenges faced by diverse tribal populations.


**3. Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023, collaborating with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)?**

(a) The World Bank
(b) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c) The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d) The World Health Organization (WHO)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with IIPS.  The other options are incorrect. While the World Bank, UNDP, and WHO are involved in various aspects of population studies and development, they are not specifically mentioned as collaborators in this particular report.  This question tests factual recall regarding the source of specific reports and the involvement of international organizations in demographic research related to India.  Understanding the roles of different UN agencies is important for comprehending global efforts in population-related issues and their impact on national-level initiatives.


**4.  According to the provided text, which Act was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952?**

(a) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(b) The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
(c) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(d) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. The other options are incorrect.  These other acts relate to different social issues and were not repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act. This question tests knowledge of Indian legal history and the evolution of legislation related to marginalized communities.  Understanding the historical context of legislation concerning criminalization of specific groups is crucial for analyzing contemporary social justice issues and the impact of past policies on present-day inequalities.


**5.  Which Ministry is responsible for implementing the Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for Denotified Tribes (DNTs) Boys and Girls?**

(a) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(b) Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Education
(d) Ministry of Women and Child Development


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions that the Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme implemented under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The other options are incorrect. While the other ministries address related social issues, this specific scholarship falls under the purview of the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. This question tests knowledge of government schemes and the allocation of responsibilities among different ministries.  Understanding the roles of various ministries is essential for analyzing government policies and their effectiveness in addressing social issues.


**6.  Which Act prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all employment, and also restricts the employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations?**

(a) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(b) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(c) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(d) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, directly addresses the prohibition of child labour below 14 years and restricts adolescent employment in hazardous occupations.  The other options, while dealing with child welfare, do not focus specifically on the legal prohibition of child labour.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of specific legislation related to child labour in India.  Knowledge of this act is crucial for comprehending the legal framework surrounding child protection and the efforts to eradicate child labour.


**7.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation of what percentage in government jobs for persons with disabilities (PwDs)?**

(a) 2%
(b) 3%
(c) 4%
(d) 5%


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, specifies a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs.  The other options are incorrect.  This question tests factual recall of specific provisions within the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.  Understanding the legal framework for PwD rights and reservation policies is essential for analyzing government efforts towards inclusivity and equal opportunities.


**8.  Which  government scheme provides free competitive exam coaching to DNTs students and health insurance to their families?**

(a)  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme
(b)  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(c)  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)
(d) Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is explicitly described in the text as providing free competitive exam coaching and health insurance to DNT families.  The other options are incorrect; they describe different schemes or organizations related to DNT welfare but do not encompass both coaching and health insurance.  This question tests knowledge of specific government schemes for DNTs.  Understanding these schemes is important for assessing government initiatives aimed at empowering marginalized communities.


**9.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prescribes a maximum punishment of what for employing individuals as manual scavengers?**

(a) A fine of Rs. 50,000
(b) Imprisonment up to 1 year
(c) Imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both
(d) Community service for a specified period


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Act clearly states that violating its provisions by employing individuals as manual scavengers can result in imprisonment up to 2 years, a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both.  The other options are incorrect.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the penalties associated with violating the law against manual scavenging.  Understanding the legal consequences of employing manual scavengers is crucial for analyzing the effectiveness of the law in preventing this practice.


**10.  Which of the following is NOT a dimension considered in the Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI) released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)?**

(a) Political
(b) Educational
(c) Economic
(d) Environmental


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GSNI, as described, focuses on Political, Educational, and Economic dimensions, along with Physical Integrity.  The Environmental dimension is not mentioned. This question tests understanding of the components of a specific index measuring gender inequality.  Knowing the specific factors considered in such indices is important for analyzing the multifaceted nature of gender inequality and the tools used to measure it.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring a deep understanding of the material and incorporating plausible distractors.  The explanations are detailed and incorporate UPSC-relevant perspectives.


**1.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects the current status of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a)  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs, exceeding all other states.
(b)  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a growing population.
(c) Odisha currently houses the highest number of recognized PVTGs.
(d)  The Bharia PVTG is exclusively found in Madhya Pradesh.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  While Madhya Pradesh has a large ST population overall, Odisha currently holds the distinction of having the highest number of recognized PVTGs. Option (a) is incorrect because it misstates the location with the highest number of PVTGs. Option (b) is incorrect as the criteria for identifying PVTGs includes a *declining or stagnant* population, not a growing one. Option (d) is incorrect because the Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, highlighting the complexities of tribal distribution across state boundaries.  Understanding the nuances of PVTG categorization and distribution across states demonstrates a crucial understanding of India's diverse tribal populations and the challenges of targeted welfare programs.


**2. The Idate Commission report, highlighted by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), primarily focuses on which of the following marginalized groups?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes (SCs) facing discrimination in urban areas.
(b)  People with disabilities (PwDs) lacking access to essential services.
(c)  De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs) in India.
(d)  Rural communities lacking access to clean drinking water and sanitation.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The Idate Commission report specifically addresses the needs of De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs).  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent other vulnerable groups in India, but they are not the primary focus of the Idate Commission report.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific commissions and their mandates, demonstrating an understanding of the complexities of addressing social justice issues in India.


**3.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  Pre-agricultural level of technology.
(b)  High levels of literacy and education.
(c)  Economic backwardness.
(d)  A declining or stagnant population.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  High levels of literacy and education are not criteria for identifying PVTGs; in fact, the opposite is true. PVTGs are characterized by low literacy rates. Options (a), (c), and (d) are all accurate criteria used to identify PVTGs. This question tests the candidate's precise understanding of the defining characteristics of PVTGs and their socio-economic conditions.


**4.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates which of the following?**

(a)  A minimum of 10% reservation in government jobs for PwDs.
(b)  The establishment of special courts in every state for faster adjudication of cases under the Act.
(c)  Reservation for PwDs is applicable to all police forces in India.
(d)  Free education for children with benchmark disabilities up to the age of 15 years.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b). The RPwD Act mandates the establishment of special courts in every district, not just every state, for faster adjudication of cases. Option (a) is incorrect; the Act mandates a minimum of 4%, not 10%, reservation in government jobs. Option (c) is incorrect because reservation is specifically *not* applicable to police forces. Option (d) is incorrect; free education is mandated up to the age of 18, not 15.  The question tests knowledge of specific provisions within the RPwD Act and highlights the importance of understanding legal frameworks for disability rights.


**5.  Which government scheme aims to provide free competitive exam coaching to DNT students and health insurance to their families?**

(a)  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme.
(b)  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship.
(c)  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED).
(d)  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT).


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The SEED scheme specifically targets the economic empowerment of DNT communities through initiatives like free coaching and health insurance.  Options (a) and (b) are other government schemes aimed at DNT welfare but don't encompass the specific combination of coaching and health insurance. Option (d) is a commission, not a scheme. This question tests the candidate's familiarity with specific government welfare programs for marginalized groups.


**6.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) makes it an offense to:**

(a)  Employ individuals to clean sewers and septic tanks with appropriate protective gear.
(b)  Construct sanitary latrines in urban areas.
(c)  Employ individuals to clean human waste from insanitary latrines without protective gear.
(d)  Demolish insanitary latrines and replace them with sanitary ones.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The PEMSR Act explicitly prohibits employing individuals to clean human waste from insanitary latrines without proper protection. Option (a) is incorrect because using protective gear is encouraged. Option (b) is incorrect because constructing sanitary latrines is a positive step. Option (d) is also incorrect, as demolishing insanitary latrines is a key aspect of the Act's preventative measures.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the legal framework aimed at eradicating manual scavenging.

(c) Ranked 111th, categorized as "Serious"
(d) Ranked 95th, categorized as "Alert"

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c). The GHI 2023 report placed India at 111th out of 125 countries, categorizing its hunger level as "Serious."  The other options present incorrect rankings and categorizations.  The question assesses factual recall of specific data from a prominent international report.


**8. Which of the following is NOT a key dimension of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as defined in the text?**

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c) Availability of specialized medical equipment in all healthcare facilities
(d) Quality


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer. While access to quality healthcare is crucial, the text focuses on accessibility, affordability, and quality as the three core dimensions of UHC. The availability of specialized equipment in *all* facilities is not explicitly stated as a core dimension, although it contributes to the overall quality of care.  This question tests the candidate's ability to identify the core concepts within a definition.


**9.  The Anganwadi system is primarily a component of which larger government program?**

(a)  National Health Mission
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
(c)  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
(d)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The Anganwadi system is an integral part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.  The other options are unrelated government programs.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the organizational structure of India's social welfare programs.


**10. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for which of the following?**

(a)  A rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects.
(b)  Proficiency in at least two languages, only one of which can be an Indian language.
(c)  A shift to an annual examination system from a semester system.
(d)  Flexibility and choice in subject selection at the secondary stage.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) accurately reflects the NCF-SE's emphasis on flexibility and choice at the secondary level. Option (a) is incorrect; the framework promotes integration. Option (b) is incorrect; it advocates for proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two Indian languages. Option (c) is incorrect; it promotes a move to a semester system, not an annual one. This question tests the candidate's understanding of educational reforms and policy changes.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a detailed understanding of the provided information.


**1.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced a significant change concerning the use of donor gametes in surrogacy. Which statement accurately reflects this change?**

(a) The use of donor gametes is now completely prohibited.
(b) Donor gametes are permitted only if the intending couple provides at least one gamete.
(c) Single women can use donor gametes regardless of their own gamete status.
(d) The rules remain unchanged regarding the use of donor gametes in surrogacy.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 amendment to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules specifically allows the use of donor gametes under a strict condition: the resulting child must have at least one gamete (either egg or sperm) from the intending couple.  This represents a significant departure from the previous prohibition (Rule 7 of the 2022 Rules). Option (a) is incorrect because the amendment does not completely prohibit donor gametes; it merely sets a condition for their use. Option (c) is also incorrect because the rules still place restrictions on single women seeking surrogacy, requiring them to use their own eggs. Option (d) is incorrect as the rules have been explicitly amended. The amendment reflects a nuanced approach balancing the needs of infertile couples with ethical considerations surrounding surrogacy.  It attempts to prevent the exploitation of surrogate mothers while providing access to assisted reproductive technologies for those who genuinely require them. The amendment also underscores the legal framework's evolving understanding of surrogacy within the Indian context.


**2. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, as amended in 2021, provides for the termination of pregnancy up to a certain gestational age under specific conditions. What is the correct gestational age limit under the amended Act for termination available to all women on the advice of one doctor?**

(a) 12 weeks
(b) 16 weeks
(c) 20 weeks
(d) 24 weeks


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The MTP Act, amended in 2021, allows for termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women based on the advice of one doctor.  This represents a liberalization of the previous law, making abortion more accessible. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they represent gestational age limits below the 20-week limit specified in the amended act. The 20-week limit represents a significant policy change aimed at increasing women's reproductive autonomy and access to safe abortion services.  However, the Act also includes provisions for terminations beyond 20 weeks under specific circumstances, such as fetal abnormalities or threats to the mother's health, requiring the advice of multiple doctors. The amendment reflects a balance between protecting women's health and rights while maintaining safeguards to prevent misuse of the law.  It also highlights the ongoing debate and evolving legal interpretation of abortion rights in India.


**3. The Anganwadi system in India is a cornerstone of which larger government initiative aimed at improving the nutritional and health status of vulnerable populations?**

(a)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b)  National Health Policy 2017
(c)  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme
(d)  Intensified Mission Indradhanush


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Anganwadi system is an integral part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.  ICDS is a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at improving the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  While Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the National Health Policy 2017, and Intensified Mission Indradhanush all contribute to improving health outcomes in India, they are not the direct umbrella program encompassing the Anganwadi system.  The Anganwadi centers provide a crucial platform for delivering essential services under ICDS, including supplementary nutrition, immunization, and health check-ups.  The ICDS scheme represents a comprehensive approach to early childhood development, recognizing the critical role of nutrition and healthcare in shaping the future health and well-being of the nation.  Its success is dependent on the effective functioning of the Anganwadi network, highlighting the interconnectedness of social welfare programs in India.


**4.  Which of the following organizations released the report titled “Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)” ?**

(a) UNICEF
(b) World Bank
(c) World Health Organization (WHO)
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Organization (WHO) released the report on the burden of disease attributable to unsafe WASH services. While UNICEF and the World Bank also work extensively on WASH-related issues and often release reports on water, sanitation, and hygiene, the specific report mentioned in the question was released by the WHO. IFPRI focuses on food policy research and is not directly involved in publishing this type of WASH-focused report. The WHO's report highlights the significant health impact of inadequate WASH services, underscoring the importance of improving access to safe water and sanitation globally. The report’s findings are crucial for policy-makers to design effective interventions to reduce waterborne diseases and improve public health outcomes.  It also emphasizes the link between WASH and broader Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to health and well-being.

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is jointly published by Concern Worldwide (an Irish NGO) and Welt Hunger Hilfe (a German NGO).  These organizations are dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty globally. The other options list organizations that contribute to development and humanitarian efforts, but they are not the publishers of the GHI. The GHI report provides a valuable assessment of hunger levels worldwide, enabling comparisons between countries and regions, and informing policy decisions to address food insecurity.  The report's methodology, however, has been subject to debate and criticism, particularly in the context of India's ranking.  Understanding the methodologies and limitations of the GHI is critical for interpreting its findings accurately.

(d) The introduction of a single national language for all schools.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE proposes a shift from the existing four-stage school system to a new 5+3+3+4 age-based design. This represents a significant change in the structure of school education in India. While options (b) also reflect aspects of the NCF-SE, the core restructuring is the change in the number of stages and the age-based design. Option (d) is incorrect; the NCF-SE emphasizes multilingualism and the use of multiple Indian languages. The 5+3+3+4 structure aims to improve the learning outcomes by optimizing the curriculum and pedagogy at different stages of development. It also addresses the need for flexibility and choice, especially at the secondary level.

(c)  Mandatory participation of all educational institutions.
(d)  Multiple entry and exit options within the educational system.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the NCrF aims for broad integration of credits, it does not mandate the participation of *all* educational institutions. The framework encourages participation but doesn't impose it as a legal requirement. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect key elements of the NCrF.  The NCrF is a significant step towards creating a more flexible and accessible educational system in India. It allows individuals to accumulate credits from various sources, enhancing their career prospects and promoting lifelong learning.

(b) Less than 50% access to at least basic water or sanitation services.
(c) High ranking in the UNICEF Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI).
(d)  High prevalence of malnutrition among children under five.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While malnutrition is a significant concern for children in many regions, the "triple threat" as defined by UNICEF specifically focuses on three WASH-related factors: low access to basic water and sanitation, high mortality rates due to unsafe WASH, and high risk of climate and environmental hazards.  High prevalence of malnutrition is a separate, though often related, public health challenge.  The "triple threat" framework highlights the interconnectedness of WASH challenges with climate change and its disproportionate impact on children's health and well-being.  Addressing these interconnected issues requires a multi-sectoral approach, integrating WASH interventions with broader initiatives related to climate resilience and nutrition.


**10.  The Paris Principles, adopted in 1993, are standards for which type of institution?**

(a) International Organizations focused on Economic Development
(b) National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs)
(c) International Courts of Justice
(d)  Specialized Agencies of the United Nations related to Human Rights


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Paris Principles provide minimum standards for the establishment and functioning of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs).  These principles guide the establishment of independent and effective NHRIs that can protect and promote human rights within their respective countries.  The other options are incorrect; the Paris Principles are not directly relevant to the standards of international organizations for economic development, international courts, or other UN specialized agencies though they might indirectly impact their work. The Paris Principles are a crucial instrument for promoting the development of strong and effective NHRIs globally.  The principles emphasize the importance of independence, impartiality, and pluralism in ensuring the effectiveness of NHRIs in protecting human rights.  Compliance with the Paris Principles is often a key factor in assessing the credibility and effectiveness of national human rights mechanisms.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question focuses on specific details and requires a high level of factual recall and analytical skills.


**1.  The Global Gender Gap Index, released annually, incorporates which four parameters for its assessment?**

(a) Economic Participation, Health and Survival, Political Empowerment, and Technological Advancement.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Global Gender Gap Index, published by the World Economic Forum, specifically uses Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment as its four key parameters. Option (a) is incorrect because technological advancement is not a primary parameter. Options (c) and (d) include elements not directly part of the GGGI's framework. The GGGI focuses on comparing gender gaps across specific dimensions of societal development, not broader concepts like economic growth or social development in general.  It's crucial to understand the precise parameters used to avoid misinterpretations of the index's findings and its implications for policymaking concerning gender equality.


**2.  The Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI), developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), aims to understand what specific aspect of gender inequality?**

(a) The impact of gender inequality on economic growth.
(b) The disparities in access to education and healthcare between genders.
(c) The systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women worldwide.
(d) The role of cultural norms in shaping gender roles and expectations.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The GSNI's primary goal is to comprehensively assess and quantify the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women globally. While options (b) and (d) touch upon related aspects, they don't capture the GSNI's holistic approach. Option (a) is too narrow, focusing solely on economics, whereas the GSNI considers a broader range of social and political factors. The GSNI's importance lies in its ability to provide a quantitative measure of deeply ingrained societal biases, helping to identify areas requiring targeted interventions to promote gender equality.

**Explanation:** Ayushman Bharat Yojana (ABY) is a comprehensive health insurance scheme aiming to provide healthcare access to a large segment of the population.  It addresses health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. While the other options address specific aspects of healthcare, ABY's scope is broader, encompassing the holistic approach described in the question. Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on immunization, National Health Policy 2017 sets overarching goals, and ABDM focuses on digital infrastructure.  ABY integrates various interventions to achieve better health outcomes across different care levels.


**2.  A report highlights the integration of credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, aiming for seamless transitions and lifelong learning opportunities. Which framework facilitates this integration?**

(a)  National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(b)  National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(c)  National Credit Framework (NCrF)
(d)  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is explicitly designed to integrate credits earned across various educational pathways.  It acts as a "meta-framework," unifying NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF to enhance flexibility and mobility in education.  While NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF-SE address specific educational sectors, only NCrF facilitates the seamless integration of credits across all three, as described in the question.  The NCrF's goal is to enable students to move fluidly between different educational and skill-development programs.


**3.  Which organization released a report indicating that progress on over half of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is weak or has stalled, citing factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and environmental crises?**

(a)  UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund)
(b)  WFP (World Food Programme)
(c)  IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute)
(d)  UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) is responsible for monitoring and reporting on the progress of the SDGs.  The question's description directly reflects the content of the UNDESA's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023.  The other organizations, while involved in development, do not specifically release reports with the stated focus on overall SDG progress and the cited challenges.  UNDESA's mandate includes analyzing global development trends and providing data on the achievement of the SDGs.


**4.  A government report categorizes states and districts into ten grades based on school education system performance using data from UDISE+ and NAS. Which assessment index is described?**

(a)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
(b)  Performance Grading Index (PGI)
(c)  Global Hunger Index (GHI)
(d)  Gender Social Norms Index


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Performance Grading Index (PGI) is the assessment system described in the question.  It uses data from UDISE+ and NAS to evaluate the performance of school education systems at state and district levels, categorizing them into a tiered grading system.  The other indices (NIRF, GHI, Gender Social Norms Index) address different aspects of development, not school education system performance. The PGI's focus on grading states and districts based on educational outcomes makes it the correct answer.


**5.  This Act aims to prevent discrimination against a specific group based on their gender identity not matching their assigned birth gender, establishing a grievance redressal mechanism and providing for identity certificates. Which Act is this?**

(a)  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005
(b)  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c)  Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019
(d)  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, directly addresses the rights and protection of transgender individuals.  It defines transgender persons, prohibits discrimination, and provides for identity certificates and grievance redressal. The other acts focus on different vulnerable groups and concerns.  The Act's specific provisions regarding gender identity, discrimination, and redressal mechanisms make it the only correct option.


**6.  A committee recommended reforms to the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions, suggesting a transition to a binary accreditation system ("Accredited" or "Not Accredited") with subcategories for institutions close to the threshold. Which committee is this?**

(a)  Idate Commission
(b)  Renke Commission
(c)  Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee
(d)  UNDhebar Commission


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee was tasked with reforming the accreditation system for Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in India.  The description of the binary accreditation system with subcategories directly aligns with the committee's recommendations. The other commissions focused on different social issues and did not address HEI accreditation. The committee's specific mandate and the details of its proposed reforms make it the correct answer.


**7.  Which organization, in collaboration with IIPS, released a report focusing on demographic trends related to India's aging population?**

(a)  UNDESA
(b)  UNCRC
(c)  UNFPA
(d)  WFP


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).  The other organizations do not have this specific focus on aging population demographics in India. UNFPA's mandate includes monitoring population trends, making it the logical choice for this report.  The report's subject matter and the collaboration with IIPS directly pinpoint UNFPA.


**8.  A scheme aims to saturate Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) households with basic facilities like housing, water, sanitation, education, and healthcare, incorporating initiatives for disease elimination and nutritional support. Which scheme is this?**

(a)  SMILE (Support for Marginalised Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise)
(b)  PM JANMAN (PM- Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan)
(c)  SEED (Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities)
(d)  National Child Labour Project (NCLP)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  PM JANMAN is the scheme specifically designed to provide comprehensive support to PVTGs, focusing on the saturation of basic facilities and incorporating various health and nutritional programs.  The other schemes target different groups or aspects of development.  PM JANMAN's holistic approach to PVTG development, including disease elimination and nutritional support, distinguishes it from other initiatives.


**9.  Which Act prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all employment, while also prohibiting adolescents (14-18 years) from working in hazardous occupations?**

(a)  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012
(b)  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c)  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(d)  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, specifically addresses the prohibition of child labour, setting age limits and specifying hazardous occupations.  The other acts deal with different aspects of child protection, not directly with the prohibition and regulation of child labor.  The Act's focus on age limits and hazardous occupations makes it the correct answer.


**10.  The government's initiative to promote 100% mechanization in sanitation, including sewer and septic tank cleaning, desilting of drains, and waste disposal, is known by which name?**

(a)  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)
(b)  ODF Plus
(c)  NAMASTE (National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem) scheme
(d)  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** NAMASTE is the specific government scheme focused on mechanized sanitation.  The other options address broader sanitation goals or the rehabilitation of manual scavengers. NAMASTE's direct aim to mechanize sanitation processes makes it the correct option.  The scheme's comprehensive approach to mechanized sanitation distinguishes it from other initiatives.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  The questions aim for a difficult level, requiring detailed knowledge and understanding.


**1.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for a significant restructuring of the school education system. Which of the following is NOT a key feature of this restructuring as proposed by the NCF-SE?**

(a) A shift to a semester system instead of an annual exam pattern.
(b)  The implementation of a rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects.
(c)  The promotion of multilingualism, encouraging proficiency in at least three languages.
(d)  The incorporation of contributions to knowledge by Indians from ancient to contemporary times.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE explicitly aims to break down rigid separations between academic and vocational subjects, promoting a more holistic and flexible approach to learning. Option (a) is correct as the NCF-SE proposes a move to a semester system. Option (c) is also a key element, emphasizing multilingualism and the importance of Indian languages. Option (d) accurately reflects the NCF-SE's aim to integrate Indian contributions to knowledge across different disciplines. Option (b) is incorrect because the framework actively works against rigid subject separations.  The intent is to create a more interconnected and adaptable educational experience for students, allowing for greater choice and flexibility in their learning pathways.


**2. The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education systems assesses performance at State and District levels. Which of the following statements about the PGI 2.0 for the year 2021-22 is FALSE?**

(a)  The index utilizes data from UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021.
(b)  States/UTs are classified into ten grades, with 'Daksh' being the highest grade.
(c)  Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram achieved the highest grade, 'Daksh', in PGI 2.0.
(d)  The index showed a reduction in the deviation between the maximum and minimum scores compared to 2017-18.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PGI 2.0 uses data from UDISE+ and NAS, classifying states/UTs into ten grades (a).  'Daksh' is indeed the highest grade (b), and the 2021-22 index did show a decrease in score deviation compared to 2017-18 (d). However, statement (c) is false.  The report explicitly states that *no* States/UTs attained the highest grade ('Daksh') in PGI 2.0; the top grade achieved was 'Prachesta-2'. The inclusion of this false statement as a distractor makes the question more challenging, requiring precise recall of the report's findings.  Understanding the grading system and the actual results is crucial for accurate analysis.


**3. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) introduced several significant provisions. Which of the following is NOT a provision included in the RPwD Act?**

(a)  Reservation for PwDs in government jobs and government-aided higher educational institutions.
(b)  Recognition of 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
(c)  Exemption of police forces from reservation mandates for PwDs.
(d)  The establishment of a special court in each district for faster adjudication of cases under the Act.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act mandates reservations for PwDs in government jobs and higher educational institutions (a) and recognizes a broad range of disabilities (b), including those mentioned in the option. It also establishes special courts for quicker case resolution (d). Option (c) is the incorrect answer.  The act explicitly states that the 4% reservation in government jobs does *not* apply to police forces (including the Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, and Delhi/UT police). This specific exemption demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the legislation, making this a challenging question for candidates who may have a general understanding of the act but lack precise knowledge of its specifics.


**4.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate credits earned through various educational pathways. Which of the following is NOT a key objective or feature of the NCrF?**

(a)  The creation of a single, inclusive framework for seamless credit transfer across school, higher, and vocational education.
(b)  The establishment of a rigid, inflexible system to prevent credit transfer between different educational streams.
(c)  The utilization of the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF).
(d)  Enabling lifelong learning by allowing multiple entry and exit options within the educational ecosystem.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF's core purpose is to create a unified and flexible credit system (a), integrating various educational pathways using existing frameworks (c) and promoting lifelong learning (d). Option (b) is incorrect because the NCrF explicitly aims for flexibility and mobility in credit transfer, directly opposing a rigid and inflexible system.  The framework’s design is fundamentally built on the principle of seamless integration and transferability of credits earned through diverse learning experiences.  Understanding this core principle is essential for correctly answering the question.


**5.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced changes to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021. Which statement regarding these amendments is INCORRECT?**

(a)  The amendments allow surrogacy using donor gametes under specific medical conditions.
(b)  The amendments permit single women (widows or divorcees) to undergo surrogacy using donor sperm and self-eggs.
(c) The amendments maintain the complete prohibition of commercial surrogacy.
(d) The amendments revoke the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in the Arun Muthuvel case.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 amendments allow surrogacy with donor gametes under specific medical circumstances (a) and permit single women to use donor sperm and their own eggs (b).  The ban on commercial surrogacy remains in effect (c).  However, (d) is incorrect. The amendments do not revoke the Supreme Court's 2023 decision in the Arun Muthuvel case, which allowed a woman with MRKH Syndrome to use donor eggs for surrogacy. The amendments, in fact, can be seen as partially building upon the court's recognition of the need for flexibility in surrogacy regulations to accommodate specific medical conditions.  A thorough understanding of both the amendments and the court decision is necessary to identify the false statement.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.  The difficulty level is assessed as 'difficult' for each.


**1.  The  "Social Model for Divyangjan inclusive care"  under the POSHAN Abhiyan, as implemented through Anganwadi centers, is characterized by which of the following three-step approaches?**

(a)  Early detection of disabilities, vocational training for children, and government job placement.
(b)  Screening for early disability signs, family counseling, and specialized school enrollment.
(c)  Screening for early disability signs, inclusion in community events and empowering families, referral support via ASHA/ANM & Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) teams.
(d)  Disability assessment by specialists, individualized education plans, and financial aid to families.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The POSHAN Abhiyan's approach, as described in the text, focuses on a three-pronged strategy: early identification of disabilities through screening, active community participation and family empowerment, and linking children and families with support services through established networks like ASHA, ANM, and RBSK.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are partially correct but lack the comprehensive and interconnected nature of the actual three-step approach. Option (a) is incomplete as it misses the crucial elements of community integration and support system engagement. Option (b) omits the crucial referral mechanism for accessing further specialized support. Option (d) focuses on a medicalized approach, neglecting the community engagement aspect.


**2.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects the key legal provisions concerning manual scavenging in India?**

(a) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, allows for manual scavenging under strict safety regulations.
(b)  The Act only addresses the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, not the prevention of the practice.
(c) The Act penalizes the construction of insanitary latrines but does not mandate their demolition or conversion.
(d)  The Act makes it an offense to employ people as manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines, employ people to clean sewers and septic tanks without protective gear, and construct insanitary latrines.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Option (d) accurately summarizes the key prohibitions outlined in the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013.  It correctly identifies the offenses related to employing manual scavengers in unsafe conditions and the construction of insanitary latrines. Option (a) is incorrect because the Act explicitly bans manual scavenging. Option (b) is false as the Act actively works towards both prevention and rehabilitation. Option (c) is incorrect as the Act mandates both the demolition and conversion of insanitary latrines.


**3.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates which of the following reservations?**

(a) A minimum of 10% reservation in government jobs and higher educational institutions.
(b)  A minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and 5% in government-aided higher educational institutions.
(c)  Reservation only in government-aided institutions, with no stipulation for government jobs.
(d)  Reservations in all government and private sector jobs and educational institutions.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Act specifically mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs and not less than 5% reservation in government/government-aided higher educational institutions. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the specific percentages and scope of the mandated reservations.  Option (a) overestimates the reservation percentages. Option (c) is inaccurate by omitting the reservation for government jobs. Option (d) is incorrect as it extends the reservation to the private sector which is not covered by the act.


**4.  According to the information provided, which state houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c)  Andaman and Nicobar Islands
(d) Odisha


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have significant PVTG populations, Odisha surpasses them according to the given data.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are mentioned as having some PVTGs, but not the highest number.


**5. The  "Triple Threat"  as defined by UNICEF's report on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) related threats faced by children, includes which three factors?**

(a) Limited access to clean water, high rates of waterborne diseases, and lack of sanitation education.
(b) Less than 50% access to at least basic water or sanitation services, within top 20 countries, highest burden of deaths attributable to unsafe WASH among children under 5, within top 25% of countries facing highest risk of climate and environmental hazards in UNICEF’s Children’s Climate Risk Index (CCRI).
(c) Inadequate sanitation infrastructure, poor hygiene practices, and insufficient government funding for WASH programs.
(d)  High rates of child mortality, malnutrition, and lack of access to healthcare.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The "Triple Threat" is explicitly defined in the text as the combination of low access to basic water and sanitation services, high mortality rates from unsafe WASH among children under five, and high risk from climate and environmental hazards, as indicated by UNICEF's Children's Climate Risk Index. Options (a), (c), and (d) represent related but distinct sets of challenges.


**6.  Which of the following accurately describes the key objective of the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan?**

(a) To eradicate all forms of malnutrition in India within five years.
(b) To improve the nutritional status of pregnant women and children under five years of age.
(c) To provide free nutritious meals to all children in India.
(d) To reduce stunting in identified Districts of India with the highest malnutrition burden by improving utilization of key Anganwadi Services.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The primary objective of POSHAN Abhiyan is to reduce stunting, a major form of malnutrition, specifically targeting districts with high malnutrition prevalence by improving the Anganwadi services' utilization. Options (a), (b), and (c) are partially accurate but do not fully capture the mission's focused approach. Option (a) is overly ambitious and unrealistic in its timeframe. Option (b) is too broad and doesn't reflect the targeted approach. Option (c) is not the primary focus of the scheme.


**7. The  "Paris Principles,"  relevant to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), primarily serve which purpose?**

(a) To establish international standards for human rights investigations.
(b) To outline the structure and composition of national human rights institutions.
(c)  To provide guidelines for the accreditation of national human rights institutions in compliance with GANHRI standards and helps in development of standards for NHRI across the world.
(d) To define the jurisdiction and powers of international human rights courts.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Paris Principles, as mentioned, are crucial for the development of standards for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) globally and help GANHRI review and accredit them.  While the other options touch upon related aspects, they don't directly address the core function of the Paris Principles within the GANHRI framework.


**8. The  "Global Gender Gap Index,"  released annually by the World Economic Forum, uses which four parameters for its assessment?**

(a) Economic participation, education, health, and political empowerment.
(b)  Income equality, social mobility, gender-based violence, and reproductive rights.
(c)  Literacy rates, employment opportunities, access to healthcare, and political representation.
(d)  Life expectancy, economic opportunity, education levels, and social progress.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the Global Gender Gap Index utilizes economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment as its four key parameters. The other options include some relevant factors but do not encompass the precise four parameters used in the index.


**9. The  "National Credit Framework (NCrF)" in India primarily aims to achieve which of the following?**

(a) Standardize the curriculum across all educational institutions.
(b) Integrate credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education to enable flexibility and mobility among them.
(c)  Increase the number of years required for higher education degrees.
(d)  Eliminate vocational education from the education system.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCrF's core purpose is to create a unified system that allows students to accumulate and transfer credits earned through various educational pathways, thus enhancing flexibility and mobility. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect; the NCrF does not aim to standardize the curriculum, increase the duration of higher education, or eliminate vocational education.


**10.  Which organization released the "India Ageing Report 2023"?**

(a) The World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in collaboration with International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
(c)  The National Institute of Social Sciences (NISS)
(d)  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), India


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text specifically attributes the release of the "India Ageing Report 2023" to the UNFPA in collaboration with the IIPS.  The other organizations are not mentioned in the context of this report's release.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues and adhering to the specified criteria.  Each question aims for a difficult level, demanding precise factual recall and conceptual understanding.


**1.  The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India is found in which state?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Jharkhand
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The text explicitly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, this question specifically asks about PVTGs, a distinct category within Scheduled Tribes.  Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand also have significant tribal populations, but the provided information clearly indicates Odisha as the state with the most PVTGs.  The question tests factual recall of a specific detail related to the geographical distribution of vulnerable tribal communities within India, a key area of concern for social justice and development policies.


**2. Which commission's recommendations led to the initial recognition of Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973?**

(a)  The Mandal Commission
(b) The Renke Commission
(c) The Idate Commission
(d) The Dhebar Commission

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage directly states that PTGs (later renamed PVTGs) were first recognized in 1973 based on the recommendations of the U.N. Dhebar Commission (1961). The Mandal Commission focused on Other Backward Classes (OBCs), the Renke Commission on nomadic tribes, and the Idate Commission on De-Notified Tribes. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the historical context of tribal welfare policies in India and their understanding of the specific commissions involved in shaping these policies.  The precise naming of the commission and the year of its report are crucial for correct identification, highlighting the need for detailed factual knowledge.


**3.  The "SEED" scheme, aimed at the economic empowerment of a specific vulnerable group, falls under the purview of which ministry?**

(a) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
(d) Ministry of Minority Affairs

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly mentions that the "Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)" is launched by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  This question tests the candidate's ability to link a specific government scheme with the responsible ministry, demonstrating understanding of India's administrative structure and social welfare programs.  The other options represent ministries involved in related social welfare initiatives, but the SEED scheme's specific allocation to the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment makes them incorrect.


**4.  Which Act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a piece of legislation that had significant negative impacts on certain communities?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act
(b) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act
(c) The Habitual Offenders Act
(d) The National Commission for Scheduled Castes Act

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the historical context of discriminatory legislation against marginalized communities in India and the subsequent legal reforms aimed at rectifying the injustices.  The other options are related to social justice and welfare but do not address the specific repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act. The precise knowledge of the repealing act is crucial for a correct response.


**5. According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016,  reservation for PwDs is *not* applicable to which of the following?**

(a) Government-aided higher educational institutions
(b) Government jobs
(c) Police forces
(d) Public sector undertakings

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that reservation for PwDs is not applicable to police forces (including Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, and police forces of Delhi and other Union Territories). While the Act mandates reservations in government jobs and government-aided higher educational institutions, the exclusion of police forces represents a specific exception to the general rule. This question tests the candidate's ability to identify exceptions and limitations within a specific legal framework, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the legislation.


**6. The UN body responsible for reviewing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) in compliance with the Paris Principles is:**

(a) The UN Human Rights Council
(b) The UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(c) The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d) The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that GANHRI (formerly the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions) is responsible for reviewing and accrediting NHRIs based on the Paris Principles.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of international human rights mechanisms and the role of GANHRI in promoting standards for national human rights institutions. The other options are involved in human rights protection but do not have the specific responsibility of accreditation based on the Paris Principles.  The question tests precise knowledge about the mandate of a specific international organization.


**7. The  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is primarily tasked with:**

(a) Providing financial assistance to DNT members.
(b) Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
(c) Implementing rehabilitation programs for manual scavengers.
(d) Monitoring the implementation of the Forest Rights Act.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the NCDNT's mandate includes preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs. While the NCDNT is involved in broader efforts to improve the welfare of DNTs, this question focuses on its primary task as described in the text. The other options are related to social welfare initiatives but are not the primary function of the NCDNT. This question tests precise knowledge about the specific responsibilities of a government body.


**8.  The  "Annapurti" initiative, mentioned in relation to the World Food Programme's activities in India, is best described as:**

(a) A program for providing mid-day meals to school children.
(b) An initiative for multi-micronutrient fortification of food.
(c) A system for food insecurity mapping and monitoring.
(d) A system of automatic grain dispensers (ATMs) for rice.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage specifically describes "Annapurti" as a pilot project involving automatic grain dispensers – ATMs for rice distribution, as part of WFP's efforts to transform the Targeted Public Distribution System in India.  The other options represent other WFP initiatives in India, but they are not the correct description of Annapurti. This question tests the candidate's ability to associate a specific initiative with its correct description within a broader context.


**9. Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023?**

(a) UNDESA
(b) UNFPA
(c)  UNHCR
(d) World Bank

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).  The other options are international organizations involved in development and humanitarian work, but the report's authorship is explicitly attributed to UNFPA. This question tests the candidate's ability to connect a specific report with its publishing organization.


**10. The  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) emphasizes which of the following aspects of science education?**

(a) Rote memorization of scientific facts
(b) Development of capacities for scientific inquiry
(c) Exclusive focus on theoretical concepts
(d) Limited interdisciplinary approaches

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage highlights that the NCF-SE emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry, in addition to acquiring knowledge of fundamental theories and laws. The other options contradict the framework's stated emphasis on inquiry-based learning and interdisciplinary connections.  This question tests understanding of educational policy and its focus on pedagogical approaches.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the subject matter.


**1.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, significantly altered the landscape of surrogacy in India. Which of the following accurately reflects a key change introduced by these rules?**

(a)  Commercial surrogacy was legalized under strict government oversight.
(b)  The use of donor gametes was completely prohibited in all surrogacy cases.
(c)  Single women were explicitly barred from utilizing surrogacy services.
(d)  Under specific medical conditions, surrogacy using donor gametes is permitted, provided at least one gamete is from the intending couple.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, made a crucial amendment to the previously existing regulations. While the overarching principle of altruistic surrogacy remained, a critical exception was introduced.  The rules now allow for surrogacy using donor gametes if the intending couple has a medically certified condition necessitating it. However, a critical condition is that the child must have at least one gamete (either egg or sperm) originating from one of the intending parents. This addresses the concerns of infertility while maintaining the core principle of preventing exploitative commercial surrogacy. Option (a) is incorrect because the amendment reinforced the ban on commercial surrogacy. Option (b) is incorrect because the rules created a specific exception for donor gametes under defined medical circumstances. Option (c) is incorrect; while regulations are stringent, the rules do not entirely bar single women from surrogacy,  allowing it under specific conditions involving self-eggs and donor sperm.


**2.  The landmark Supreme Court judgment in *Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India* had a direct impact on surrogacy laws. What was the central issue addressed in this case?**

(a)  The legality of commercial surrogacy for foreign nationals.
(b)  The permissibility of surrogacy for same-sex couples.
(c)  The right of a woman with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome to undergo surrogacy using a donor egg.
(d)  The ethical implications of gestational surrogacy versus traditional surrogacy.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The *Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India* case specifically dealt with the legal rights of a woman suffering from Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a rare condition causing uterine factor infertility. The Supreme Court's ruling in this case expanded the scope of permissible surrogacy by allowing the use of donor eggs in cases where the intending mother is medically unable to provide her own egg.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they address different aspects of surrogacy law that were not the central focus of this particular case. The case highlighted the intersection of reproductive rights and medical advancements in the context of surrogacy.


**3.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, has undergone amendments to broaden access to abortion services. Which of the following is NOT a provision under the amended MTP Act?**

(a)  Termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks is available to all women based on the advice of one registered medical practitioner.
(b)  Specific provisions allow for termination beyond 20 weeks under certain circumstances, such as fetal abnormalities.
(c)  The Act mandates mandatory spousal consent for all abortions.
(d)  The Act aims to ensure safe and legal abortion services for women.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The amended MTP Act aims to make abortion access safer and more accessible for women.  While it permits termination up to 20 weeks based on the opinion of a single doctor and allows for later terminations under specific circumstances (like fetal abnormalities), it does *not* mandate spousal consent. The removal of this requirement was a significant change aimed at empowering women to make decisions about their reproductive health. Option (a) and (d) are directly supported by the Act. Option (b) reflects the exceptions made in the amended law.


**4.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, established a robust mechanism for addressing workplace harassment.  Which component of the Act's procedure is NOT accurately described below?**

(a)  The Act mandates the formation of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in workplaces with 10 or more employees.
(b)  Aggrieved women can file complaints within three months of the incident, with the possibility of an extension.
(c)  Monetary settlements are permitted as a means of conciliation between the aggrieved woman and the respondent.
(d)  The ICC's inquiry must be completed within 90 days and a report submitted to the employer within 10 days.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sexual Harassment Act provides a detailed procedure for handling complaints.  While it emphasizes timely investigations (options a, b, and d), it explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a basis for conciliation.  The Act aims to prevent the trivialization of sexual harassment and ensure that justice is served, not merely a financial resolution.  The focus is on addressing the harm caused and holding perpetrators accountable.


**5.  The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, aims to address various aspects of menstrual health in India. Which of the following is NOT a primary objective of this policy?**

(a)  Promoting awareness and reducing stigma associated with menstruation.
(b)  Ensuring equitable access to menstrual hygiene resources for all menstruating individuals.
(c)  Mandating paid menstrual leave for all women in the workforce.
(d)  Prioritizing the needs of underserved and vulnerable populations.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy focuses on creating a stigma-free environment and ensuring access to resources.  While it emphasizes equity and prioritizes vulnerable groups, it does *not* mandate paid menstrual leave.  Paid menstrual leave is a policy being considered in some countries but is not a core component of the Indian draft policy.


**6. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, has undergone amendments to address the handling of child offenders.  Which of the following statements regarding the Act is INCORRECT?**

(a)  A child is defined as a person who has not completed 18 years of age.
(b)  The Act categorizes offenses into heinous, serious, and petty offenses based on the prescribed punishment.
(c)  The 2021 amendment removed the provision for trying children aged 16-18 as adults in heinous crimes.
(d)  The Act provides for the rehabilitation and care of children in conflict with the law.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 2015 Act, and its subsequent amendments, are complex and have been subject to much debate.  While the Act defines a child and categorizes offenses (a and b), the 2021 amendment did *not* remove the provision for trying children aged 16-18 as adults in heinous crimes. This remains a contentious aspect of the law.  The Act also emphasizes rehabilitation (d).



**7.  The National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, established a significant institution for scientific research in India. Which of the following is NOT a key function of the Anusandhan NRF as per the Act?**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a nuanced understanding of the material.


**1.  Which statement accurately reflects the current status of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a)  PVTGs are exclusively located in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.
(b) The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-industrial technology, high literacy rates, and a rapidly growing population.
(c)  The number of officially recognized PVTGs has remained constant since 1973.
(d)  Odisha currently houses the highest number of recognized PVTGs.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because Odisha currently holds the highest number of recognized PVTGs among Indian states.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect. Option (a) is false because PVTGs are spread across 18 states and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, not limited to Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. Option (b) misrepresents the criteria; PVTGs are characterized by pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. Option (c) is inaccurate; the number of PVTGs and their designation (initially Primitive Tribal Groups, then renamed) have evolved over time.  The understanding of PVTGs requires knowledge of their unique socio-economic vulnerabilities and the government's efforts to address their needs within the framework of tribal welfare policies.


**2.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)'s recent emphasis on the implementation of the Idate Commission report highlights concerns about which marginalized group?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b)  Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)
(c)  De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)
(d)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NHRC's focus on the Idate Commission report directly relates to the De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs).  The report recommended establishing a permanent commission to address the specific challenges faced by this vulnerable population.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; while these groups also experience marginalization, the NHRC's action specifically targets the DNTs' historical vulnerabilities and the need for dedicated policy interventions.  This question tests the understanding of India's social justice initiatives and the specific concerns surrounding historically marginalized communities.


**3. Which of the following accurately describes the "Drain of Wealth Theory"?**

(a) It was formulated by R.C. Dutt to explain the economic exploitation of India under British rule.
(b) It argued that India's economic prosperity was fueled by its trade with Britain.
(c) It was developed by Dadabhai Naoroji to demonstrate the positive impact of British colonialism.
(d) It was primarily focused on the social inequalities within Indian society during the colonial period.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Dadabhai Naoroji's "Drain of Wealth Theory" is a cornerstone of understanding the economic exploitation of India under British rule.  Naoroji meticulously documented how British policies systematically drained India's resources, leading to impoverishment.  Option (b) is the opposite of the theory's central argument. Option (c) is incorrect; the theory demonstrated the *negative* impact of British colonialism. Option (d) is incorrect; while the theory had broader implications for social structures, its core focus was economic.  The question tests the ability to recall key figures and their contributions to the understanding of Indian history and economics.


**4. Which governmental initiative primarily aims to empower De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs) economically?**

(a)  The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme
(b)  The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(c)  The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme
(d)  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is specifically designed to address the economic needs of DNTs.  It includes provisions for competitive exam coaching and health insurance, directly targeting economic empowerment. Options (a) and (c) provide support but are not primarily focused on economic empowerment. Option (d) is a commission for policy and advocacy, not a direct economic empowerment scheme.  This question tests the knowledge of specific government schemes and their target beneficiaries, demonstrating an understanding of policy implementation in the context of social welfare.


**5. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates which of the following?**

(a)  A minimum of 10% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.
(b)  Exemption from all taxes for individuals with benchmark disabilities.
(c)  Free healthcare services for all PwDs regardless of their income level.
(d)  A minimum of 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs (with exceptions).


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs, with exceptions for police forces. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect. The Act does not mandate 10% reservation, tax exemptions, or free healthcare for all PwDs.  The question tests knowledge of specific legal provisions and their limitations, demonstrating an understanding of the complexities of inclusive policies.


**6.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b)  High level of literacy
(c)  Economic backwardness
(d)  A declining or stagnant population


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A high level of literacy is *not* a criterion for identifying PVTGs.  PVTGs are characterized by low literacy rates, along with pre-agricultural technology, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. This question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between characteristics of PVTGs.


**7. The "ODF Plus" initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) focuses on:**

(a)  The construction of individual household toilets only.
(b)  Sustaining ODF status and implementing solid and/or liquid waste management systems.
(c)  Providing financial assistance to individuals for the construction of toilets.
(d)  Raising awareness about hygiene practices without infrastructure development.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ODF Plus initiative builds upon the Open Defecation Free (ODF) status by adding the crucial element of waste management.  This goes beyond simply having toilets and includes the management of solid and liquid waste to maintain a cleaner environment.  Options (a), (c), and (d) represent incomplete or inaccurate aspects of the ODF Plus initiative.  The question tests the understanding of the scope and goals of major government programs.


**8. The National Indicator Framework (NIF), developed by MoSPI, primarily serves to:**

(a)  Monitor the progress of only environmental sustainability goals.
(b)  Track progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
(c)  Assess the performance of only the education sector in India.
(d)  Measure the economic growth of India exclusively.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NIF is a comprehensive framework for tracking India's progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), encompassing various sectors.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are too narrow; the NIF's scope is much broader. This question tests the understanding of the purpose and function of important national planning and monitoring mechanisms.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring a thorough understanding of the material and careful consideration of the options.


**1.  The text describes a group designated as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  Which of the following statements accurately reflects the criteria used to identify PVTGs?**

(a)  High levels of literacy and advanced agricultural practices are key indicators.
(b)  Significant economic prosperity and a rapidly growing population are characteristic features.
(c)  Pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a stagnant or declining population are defining factors.
(d)  Access to modern healthcare and robust social safety nets are absent.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that PVTGs are identified based on pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a stagnant or declining population. Options (a) and (b) directly contradict this information, presenting the opposite characteristics. Option (d), while potentially true for some PVTGs, isn't a defining criterion mentioned in the text.  The identification of PVTGs highlights the government's focus on addressing the unique vulnerabilities of certain tribal communities, reflecting a commitment to inclusive development and social justice.  This is a crucial aspect of understanding India's approach to tribal welfare policies.


**2. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently emphasized the need to implement a specific commission's report concerning a vulnerable group. This group, historically labeled as "born criminals," were officially designated under a specific Act repealed in 1952.  Which group is being referred to?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b)  Other Backward Castes (OBCs)
(c)  De-Notified Tribes (DNTs)
(d)  Scheduled Tribes (STs)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions the NHRC's focus on implementing the Idate Commission report related to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs).  These communities were historically labeled "criminal tribes" under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, which was repealed in 1952.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent other marginalized groups, but the question specifically targets the group historically stigmatized as "born criminals" and addressed by the Idate Commission report.  Understanding the historical context of DNTs and their continued vulnerability is critical for analyzing social justice issues in India.


**3.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates specific accommodations for individuals with disabilities. Which of the following is NOT a provision of this Act?**

(a)  Reservation in government jobs (at least 4%).
(b)  Reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions (at least 5%).
(c)  Mandatory reservation for PwDs in police forces across India.
(d)  Free education for children with benchmark disabilities (ages 6-18).


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The RPwD Act provides for reservations in government jobs and higher education but explicitly excludes police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UTs). Options (a), (b), and (d) are all accurate provisions of the act, as detailed in the text.  Option (c) highlights a crucial exception within the Act, demonstrating the complexities of implementing inclusive policies within different sectors of government.  Understanding these nuances is essential for evaluating the efficacy of disability rights legislation.


**4. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) aims to eliminate a specific practice.  What is the central focus of this Act?**

(a)  Preventing the use of child labor in hazardous industries.
(b)  Eliminating the practice of manual scavenging.
(c)  Providing rehabilitation services for victims of human trafficking.
(d)  Ensuring safe working conditions for all sanitation workers.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act directly addresses the practice of manual scavenging—the removal of human excreta by hand from sewers or septic tanks.  While option (d) relates to the overall safety of sanitation workers, the PEMSR Act specifically targets the outlawed practice of manual scavenging.  Options (a) and (c) deal with distinct social issues. The Act's existence underscores the persistent challenge of eradicating deeply entrenched caste-based occupations and the need for comprehensive rehabilitation programs.


**5. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) proposes a significant restructuring of the school education system. Which of the following is NOT a key highlight of this framework?**

(a)  A 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.

(c)  Elimination of hard separations between academic and vocational subjects.
(d)  Restriction of multilingualism to only two Indian languages.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE promotes multilingualism, encouraging proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.  Option (d) contradicts this, advocating a limitation on language learning. Options (a), (b), and (c) accurately reflect the framework's key features. The NCF-SE's focus on multilingualism and flexible curricula demonstrates a shift toward a more inclusive and holistic approach to education.



**6.  A specific High-Level Committee, established in 2021, developed a framework to integrate credits earned through various educational pathways. This framework is designed to enhance flexibility and mobility within the education system.  Which framework is this?**

(a)  National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(b)  National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(c)  National Credit Framework (NCrF)
(d)  National Curriculum Framework (NCF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly describes the establishment of a High-Level Committee in 2021 to develop the National Credit Framework (NCrF).  This framework aims to integrate credits from school, higher education, and vocational training, promoting flexibility and mobility.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are related frameworks, but they don't address the specific integration of credits across different educational pathways as the NCrF does.  The NCrF's creation reflects the ongoing efforts to modernize India's education system and align it with global best practices.


**7.  The text mentions a specific index that tracks progress towards a global goal related to health. This index includes indicators related to maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and service capacity and access. Which index is this?**

(a)  Global Gender Gap Index
(b)  Gender Social Norms Index
(c)  UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI)
(d)  Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly describes the UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI), which tracks progress toward Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The description of its indicator categories matches the information provided. Options (a), (b), and (d) focus on different aspects of social development, not specifically health coverage. The SCI's use highlights the importance of data-driven monitoring of health outcomes and the global effort toward achieving UHC.


**8. The text details a government initiative to eliminate a specific health condition prevalent among a particular population group.  This initiative is included within a larger, multi-ministry program launched on Tribal Pride Day.  Which health condition is the focus?**

(a)  Tuberculosis (TB)
(b)  Malaria
(c)  Sickle Cell Disease
(d)  HIV/AIDS


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text mentions that PM JANMAN aims to ensure 100% saturation for Sickle Cell Disease elimination among PVTG communities. While TB elimination is also mentioned, the question specifically asks about the health condition that is the *focus* of the initiative, making Sickle Cell Disease the most appropriate answer. The inclusion of this initiative within PM JANMAN highlights the government's comprehensive approach to tribal welfare, addressing both social and health disparities.


**9.  The text describes a specific Act that established a statutory body to oversee and monitor the implementation of regulations related to a particular medical procedure. This procedure involves a woman carrying a child for an intending couple. Which Act is this?**

**Explanation:** The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, established the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) to oversee the implementation of surrogacy regulations. Options (a) and (b) are relevant laws but don't directly address the establishment of a body specifically for surrogacy. Option (d) concerns a different social issue.  The Act's existence reflects the evolving legal and ethical considerations surrounding surrogacy in India.


**10. The text mentions a specific government scheme that aims to empower a particular group through skill development and entrepreneurship training. This scheme is mentioned in a NITI Aayog report on best practices in the social sector. Which scheme is this?**

(a)  PM-Kisan
(b)  Prayatna
(c)  National Child Labour Project (NCLP)
(d)  Swachhta Udyami Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text specifically names the "Prayatna" project as a livelihood and enterprise training program for transgender people, highlighted in a NITI Aayog report.  The other options represent different government schemes focused on distinct social groups or objectives. The inclusion of Prayatna highlights the government’s efforts to address the specific needs of marginalized communities through targeted skill-development initiatives.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the provided information.


**1.  The National Indicator Framework (NIF), developed in 2018 by MoSPI, aligns with which global framework for monitoring progress on sustainable development goals?**

(a)  The World Bank's Sustainable Development Goals Index
(b)  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Report's Indicator Framework
(c) The Global Gender Gap Index of the World Economic Forum
(d) The Gender Social Norms Index of the United Nations Development Programme


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question probes the relationship between the Indian NIF and the global SDG monitoring system. Option (b) correctly identifies the Global Indicator Framework (GIF) as the UN's framework for monitoring the SDGs, with the NIF aligning with it.  Options (a), (c), and (d) represent other indices related to development but do not directly relate to the global SDG monitoring mechanism. The NIF is explicitly stated to align with the global indicators of the SDGs, making (b) the only accurate choice.  Understanding the inter-agency collaboration and the role of MoSPI in representing India in international bodies related to SDG indicators is crucial for a correct response.


**2. Which index measures the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women worldwide, using four dimensions including political, educational, economic, and physical integrity?**

(a) Global Gender Gap Index
(b) Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index
(c) Gender Social Norms Index
(d) Women’s Empowerment Index


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question assesses factual recall concerning specific indices related to gender equality. The Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI) is explicitly defined in the text as measuring the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by women globally across the four specified dimensions.  The other options, while relevant to gender equality and development, do not directly address the core focus of the GSNI as described.  Understanding the difference between these indices and their specific areas of measurement is key to answering correctly.  A strong understanding of international development indices is necessary.


**3.  The Path to Equal Report, jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP, introduces which two indices to measure women's empowerment and gender equality?**

(a) Global Gender Parity Index and the Human Development Index
(b) Women’s Empowerment Index and the Gender Inequality Index
(c) Women’s Empowerment Index and the Global Gender Parity Index
(d) Global Gender Gap Index and the Gender Social Norms Index


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This tests factual recall and comprehension of a specific report and its components.  The Path to Equal Report is explicitly mentioned as introducing the Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI).  The other options present related indices, but not the specific pair introduced in the report.  Knowing the organizations behind the report and the specific aims of the indices are crucial for selecting the correct answer.  The ability to differentiate between similar-sounding indices is a necessary skill.


**4.  The 2021 Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI) score for India reflects a decline compared to 2019. Which international organizations jointly release this index?**

(a) UNICEF and the World Health Organization
(b) The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(c) The World Health Organization and the World Bank
(d)  UNDP and the World Economic Forum


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question tests factual recall of the organizations behind a specific index. The text clearly states that the WHO and the World Bank jointly release the UHC SCI.  The other options list organizations that work in related fields but are not the correct source for this specific index.  Understanding the roles and functions of these different international organizations within the context of global health is important for getting the right answer.  Recognizing the key players in global health data and reporting is essential.


**5.  Which Ministry is the nodal Ministry responsible for the welfare of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Home Affairs

(a) ODF-compliant village
(b) ODF Plus Model village
(c)  Sustainably Clean Village
(d)  Improved Sanitation Village

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description clearly aligns with the definition of an "ODF Plus Model village," which goes beyond basic Open Defecation Free (ODF) status to encompass both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and public awareness campaigns. Option (a) is too general; it doesn't capture the enhanced features of the described village. Options (c) and (d) are also too vague and do not specifically mention the key elements of waste management and visual cleanliness that define an ODF Plus Model village.  The ODF Plus Model village designation signifies a higher level of sanitation achievement that integrates various aspects of waste management and community participation, reflecting a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to sanitation.

(c)  CRY
(d)  National Child Labour Project

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The text clearly identifies "Bachpan Bachao Andolan" (Save the Childhood Movement) as the NGO with the described activities.  The other options are either unrelated or refer to different organizations involved in child welfare.  The NGO's work highlights the significant challenge of child exploitation and the role of civil society organizations in rescuing and rehabilitating victims. The scale of the NGO's efforts underscores the importance of collaborative approaches involving government agencies, NGOs, and communities to address the issue of child labour effectively.  The rehabilitation and educational support provided by the NGO are crucial for ensuring the long-term well-being of rescued children.


**1.  Which entity is responsible for overseeing and supervising the independent ecosystem of accrediting institutions in India's higher education system, as envisioned by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020?**

(a) University Grants Commission (UGC)
(b) National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET)
(c) National Accreditation Council (NAC)
(d) Quality Council of India (QCI)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 proposed the establishment of a National Accreditation Council (NAC) to act as a meta-accrediting body.  This means the NAC would oversee and supervise the various accrediting institutions, ensuring consistency and quality across the higher education landscape. The UGC plays a significant role in recognizing institutions, but the NAC is specifically designed to manage the accreditation process itself. NABET focuses on accreditation for schools and other sectors, while QCI is a broader quality assurance body.  Therefore, the NAC is the most accurate answer, fulfilling the role of a meta-accrediting body as envisioned by NEP 2020.  The other options either have different mandates or are not the primary body responsible for overseeing the accreditation ecosystem.

(d) World Food Programme (WFP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is explicitly named as the organization that released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the IIPS.  The other options, while involved in population-related work, are not directly linked to the release of this specific report. UNDESA and UNCPD focus on broader aspects of population and development, while the WFP's mandate centers on food security. The UNFPA's focus on sexual and reproductive health and rights aligns directly with the themes likely to be covered in a report on aging populations.


**3.  According to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), which age group constitutes the Foundational Stage of schooling?**

(a) 8-11 years
(b) 11-14 years
(c) 14-18 years
(d) 3-8 years

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE proposes a new 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.  The Foundational Stage, encompassing ages 3-8, is the first stage in this new structure.  The other options represent the Preparatory, Middle, and Secondary stages, respectively, under the NCF-SE's revised structure. This change from the previous four-stage system reflects a shift towards a more holistic and developmental approach to early childhood education.


**4.  Which of the following acts seeks to repeal the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947, and establish a new regulatory body for nursing and midwifery education and training?**

(a) National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019
(b) National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023
(c) National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023
(d) Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023, specifically aims to replace the outdated Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947.  The NMC Act focuses on medical education, the NDC Act on dental education, and the NRF Act on research funding. The NNMC Act addresses the need for a modernized regulatory framework for nursing and midwifery education and training in India, highlighting the growing importance of these professions in the healthcare sector.


**5. Which Indian state houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Bihar

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Odisha is explicitly stated to house the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have significant PVTG populations, including some shared groups, Odisha surpasses them in the overall number of PVTGs within its borders.  This highlights the unique challenges and needs of tribal communities in Odisha that require specific policy attention.


**6. Which act prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all employment in India?**

(a) Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(b) Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(c) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
(d) The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, specifically prohibits the employment of children under 14 years in all forms of employment.  While the Juvenile Justice Act deals with the care and protection of children, it doesn't primarily focus on the prohibition of child labor. The Surrogacy and ART Acts address entirely different areas of social legislation.  The 2016 amendment strengthened existing laws against child labor, reflecting a commitment to protecting children's rights and well-being.


**7.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education systems in India is based on data from which two primary sources?**

(a) National Achievement Survey (NAS) and National Sample Survey (NSS)
(b) Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and National Achievement Survey (NAS)
(c) Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) and National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data
(d) District Information System for Education (DISE) and National Family Health Survey (NFHS)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PGI utilizes data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS).  UDISE+ provides data on school infrastructure, enrollment, and teacher availability, while NAS assesses student learning outcomes.  The combination of these two datasets allows for a comprehensive assessment of the performance of school education systems at the state and district levels.  The other options include irrelevant data sources or sources that do not directly contribute to the PGI's assessment methodology.


**8.  Which Ministry is the nodal ministry for Tribal Welfare in India?**

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Home Affairs
(d) Ministry of Tribal Affairs

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is explicitly identified as the nodal ministry responsible for tribal welfare in India.  While other ministries may have programs that indirectly impact tribal communities, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs has the primary and dedicated responsibility for formulating and implementing policies and programs focused on the welfare and development of tribal populations across the country.


**9.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High level of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) A declining or stagnant population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  A high level of literacy is *not* a criterion; in fact, low literacy is a characteristic often associated with PVTGs.  This highlights the socio-economic vulnerabilities that necessitate special attention and protective measures for these groups.


**10. Which international treaty forms the basis of the UNHCR's work with refugees and asylum seekers?**

(a) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(b) The Geneva Conventions
(c) The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol
(d) The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are the foundational legal documents that guide the UNHCR's mandate and actions related to refugees and asylum seekers.  While the other options address important human rights issues, they do not specifically define the legal framework for international protection of refugees as comprehensively as the 1951 Convention and its Protocol.  The UNHCR's work is deeply rooted in the principles and definitions established by these legal instruments.


**11.  The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by which organization?**

(a) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(b) World Economic Forum
(c) World Health Organization (WHO)
(d) International Monetary Fund (IMF)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The World Economic Forum (WEF) is the organization responsible for releasing the annual Global Gender Gap Index.  This index measures gender equality across various dimensions, including economic participation, education, health, and political empowerment.  While the UNDP, WHO, and IMF also address gender-related issues in their work, the WEF is the specific source for this particular index.


**12.  Which organization jointly developed the National Credit Framework (NCrF) in India?**

(a)  Only the University Grants Commission (UGC)
(b)  A High-Level Committee with members from various ministries and organizations
(c) Only the Ministry of Education
(d) Only the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCrF was not developed by a single entity but by a High-Level Committee. This committee included representatives from the UGC, AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, various ministries, and other organizations. This collaborative approach reflects the multi-faceted nature of the NCrF, which aims to integrate credits from different educational and vocational pathways.


**13.  The “triple burden” of WASH-related threats to children, as defined by UNICEF, includes all of the following EXCEPT:**

(a) Less than 50% access to at least basic water or sanitation services.
(b) High rates of childhood obesity in the country.
(c) Within the top 20 countries with the highest burden of deaths attributable to unsafe WASH among children under 5.
(d) Within the top 25% of countries facing the highest risk of climate and environmental hazards in UNICEF’s Children’s Climate Risk Index (CCRI).

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The "triple threat" defined by UNICEF focuses on access to basic services, mortality rates due to unsafe WASH, and climate risk.  Childhood obesity, while a significant health concern, is not part of UNICEF's specific definition of the "triple burden" of WASH-related threats.  The other options directly reflect the three components of this specific UNICEF framework.


**14. Which two key indicators are used to assess the severity of hunger in a country according to the Global Hunger Index (GHI)?**

(a) Undernourishment and Child Mortality
(b) Child Stunting and Child Wasting
(c) Undernourishment and Adult Mortality
(d) Adult Obesity and Child Wasting

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The GHI primarily uses Undernourishment and Child Mortality as key indicators of hunger severity.  While child stunting and wasting are related factors, they are not the primary indicators used for the overall GHI score.  The GHI's focus on undernourishment and child mortality reflects the most direct and impactful consequences of hunger.  The other options include irrelevant or less directly relevant indicators.


**15. Which of the following statements regarding the recently enacted Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, is correct?**

(a) It establishes a new research foundation but does not repeal any existing statutory body.
(b) It repeals the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008, and subsumes SERB into the NRF.
(c) The Prime Minister is not involved in the governance structure of the new foundation.
(d) The Department of Higher Education will be the administrative department for the NRF.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Anusandhan NRF Act, 2023, explicitly repeals the SERB Act, 2008, and integrates the SERB into the newly formed NRF. The Prime Minister heads the Governing Board, and the Department of Science and Technology is the administrative department.  This restructuring aims to streamline research funding and coordination in India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues and adhering to the specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.


**1.  A government initiative aims to enhance the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. This program also seeks to reduce mortality and morbidity rates associated with malnutrition. Which of the following best describes this initiative?**

(a)  National Health Mission
(b)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(c)  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
(d)  National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme is a flagship program of the Indian government primarily focused on improving the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  While the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) complements ICDS by focusing on specific nutritional targets, and the National Health Mission addresses broader health concerns, ICDS is the most comprehensive and direct answer to the question's description. Ayushman Bharat Yojana, while important for health, centers on health insurance and doesn't directly address the core aspects of child nutrition and maternal health in the way ICDS does.  The depth and breadth of ICDS's mandate make it the most accurate response.  The question specifically targets the core function of improving nutritional status and reducing malnutrition related mortality and morbidity which is precisely what ICDS aims at.


**2.  A particular tribal group is characterized by a pre-agricultural level of technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  This group is officially categorized by the Indian government as:**

(a)  Scheduled Caste (SC)
(b)  Other Backward Class (OBC)
(c)  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG)
(d)  De-notified Tribe (DNT)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description precisely matches the criteria used by the Indian government to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  These groups are recognized as requiring special attention and protection due to their extremely vulnerable socio-economic conditions. Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) are broader categories with different criteria, and while some PVTGs might overlap, the description emphasizes the unique vulnerabilities that define PVTGs. De-notified Tribes (DNTs) have a different historical context, related to their past categorization as criminal tribes, rather than their level of technological development or population trends.  The question focuses on the specific vulnerability criteria which is a key characteristic of PVTGs.


**3.  The practice of removing human excreta by hand from sewers or septic tanks, despite being legally banned, persists in certain parts of India.  What is the legal instrument that criminalizes this practice?**

(a)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b)  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(c)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(d)  The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, specifically addresses and prohibits the practice of manual scavenging. While other acts might indirectly relate to the protection of vulnerable groups or the provision of employment, only this act directly targets and criminalizes manual scavenging.  The question focuses on the legal instrument criminalizing a specific practice, making option (c) the only fitting response.  Options (a), (b), and (d) address broader social issues but do not specifically target the practice of manual scavenging.


**4.  A national-level commission in India is tasked with preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to a specific vulnerable group.  This commission also aims to address the socio-economic challenges faced by this group.  Which commission fulfills this role?**

(a)  National Commission for Scheduled Castes
(b)  National Commission for Scheduled Tribes
(c)  National Commission for Backward Classes
(d)  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is specifically mandated to address the issues of this particularly vulnerable group. The other commissions focus on other marginalized communities, such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. The question's description clearly points to the specific mandate of NCDNT, making it the correct answer.  The other options, while dealing with vulnerable groups, do not have the specific task of preparing a state-wise list of castes for this particular group.


**5.  A government scheme provides free competitive exam coaching to students from a specific community and offers health insurance to their families.  This scheme aims to empower individuals from a historically marginalized group.  What is the name of this initiative?**

(a)  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme
(b)  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(c)  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme
(d)  National Rural Livelihoods Mission


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) directly addresses the description given in the question.  It focuses on providing educational and financial assistance to members of De-notified Tribes (DNTs), a historically marginalized community. While other schemes may offer educational support or health benefits, only SEED specifically combines these elements with a focus on empowering DNTs. The question highlights the specific combination of educational and financial support for a particular community, making SEED the most appropriate answer.  The other options focus on different groups or provide a narrower range of benefits.


**6.  A legal framework in India aims to ensure that all individuals have access to a full range of quality health services without facing financial hardship.  This framework covers essential health services, from health promotion to palliative care. Which concept best describes this objective?**

(a)  National Health Policy
(b)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(c)  Universal Health Coverage (UHC)
(d)  National Health Mission


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description aligns perfectly with the definition of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), which aims to ensure that everyone has access to quality health services without financial hardship. While other options relate to healthcare initiatives in India, only UHC encompasses the broad scope and objective described in the question.  The question focuses on the core principle of access to quality healthcare services without financial burden, which is the central tenet of UHC.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a major step towards UHC but does not encompass all the aspects of UHC.  National Health Policy and National Health Mission are related frameworks but do not precisely capture the essence of UHC as described in the question.


**7.  A report examines the relative economic performance of Indian states over several decades, using indicators like share in India's GDP and relative per capita income. Which report is being described?**

(a)  Economic Survey of India
(b)  World Bank's India Development Report
(c)  Relative Economic Performance of Indian States: 1960-61 to 2023-24
(d)  Reserve Bank of India's Annual Report


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description exactly matches the content and focus of the "Relative Economic Performance of Indian States: 1960-61 to 2023-24" report.  The other reports cover broader economic aspects, or focus on different aspects of the Indian economy, or are not specifically focused on inter-state economic comparisons over a long period.  The question focuses on a specific report with a precise title and content, making option (c) the only correct answer. The other reports have a broader scope and do not specifically focus on the relative economic performance of Indian states over a long period.


**8.  The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India are found in which state?**

(a)  Madhya Pradesh
(b)  Chhattisgarh
(c)  Andhra Pradesh
(d)  Odisha


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh also have significant PVTG populations, Odisha holds the highest count.  The question directly asks for the state with the highest number of PVTGs, making Odisha the correct and unambiguous answer.  The other options present plausible distractors, as they also have substantial PVTG populations, but Odisha holds the highest number.


**9.  A specific chili pepper, known for its extreme heat, was certified by Guinness World Records and later received a Geographical Indication (GI) tag.  What is the name of this chili pepper?**

(a)  Bhut Jolokia
(b)  Naga King Chili
(c)  Kashmiri Chili
(d)  San Fernando Chili


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Naga King Chili is the only chili pepper that fits the description of being certified by Guinness World Records for its heat and subsequently receiving a GI tag. Bhut Jolokia, while also a very hot chili from Northeast India, does not fit the specific description provided in the question. The other options are not as well known for their extreme heat or GI tags. The question is designed to test the knowledge of a specific chili pepper with a unique combination of characteristics, making the Naga King Chili the only correct answer.


**10.  Which international organization released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)?**

(a)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  UNICEF


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the IIPS.  The other organizations, while active in related areas like health and development, were not involved in the release of this specific report. The question specifically mentions the report's title and collaborating institution, making UNFPA the only correct answer.  The other options are plausible distractors since they work on related issues, but the specific collaboration mentioned in the question only involves UNFPA.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring a deep understanding of the material and careful consideration of the options.


**1.  Which organization released a report titled ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report,’ highlighting a significant increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises?**

(a)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) is the UN agency specifically mandated to protect refugees and forcibly displaced people.  Their annual "Global Trends" report provides comprehensive data on global displacement.  The other organizations, while involved in international development and humanitarian efforts, do not have the primary focus on forced displacement that the UNHCR does.  IFPRI focuses on food security, UNFPA on population issues, and GANHRI on human rights institution accreditation. The report's title and subject directly point to the UNHCR's core mandate and area of expertise.  Therefore, option (c) is the only accurate answer.


**2. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate credits earned through various educational pathways. Which of the following frameworks is NOT directly encompassed by the NCrF's integration efforts?**

(a) National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(b) National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(c)  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)/National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF)
(d)  Global Indicator Framework (GIF)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NCrF explicitly aims to integrate the NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF-SE/NSEQF to create a seamless credit transfer system across school, higher education, and vocational training. The Global Indicator Framework (GIF), however, is a global standard for tracking Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is not directly related to the internal structure of India's educational credit system.  While there might be indirect links between SDG progress and educational attainment, the NCrF's primary focus is on domestic educational frameworks.  Therefore, only (d) is not a direct component of the NCrF's integration.


**3.  Which legal framework in India governs the adoption of orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered children, and children of relatives, outlining processes managed by CARA and SARAs?**

(a) Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956
(b)  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c)  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(d)  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, is the primary legal instrument regulating adoption in India for children in need of care and protection.  While HAMA, 1956, deals with adoption within the Hindu community, the JJ Act, 2015, has a broader scope, encompassing inter-country and intra-country adoptions and the roles of CARA (Central Adoption Resource Authority) and SARAs (State Adoption Resource Agencies). The other acts, (c) and (d), address entirely different social issues – manual scavenging and the rights of persons with disabilities, respectively.  The question specifically asks about the legal framework for adoption, making (b) the most appropriate and accurate answer.


**4.  The 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report, released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, categorized India's hunger situation as "Serious."  Which of the following indicators was NOT a component used in determining India's GHI score?**

(a) Undernourishment
(b) Child Stunting
(c)  Child Wasting
(d)  Adult Literacy Rate

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The GHI uses four indicators to assess the severity of hunger: undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality.  While adult literacy is related to overall societal development and may indirectly influence nutrition outcomes, it is not one of the four key indicators directly used in calculating the GHI score.  The other three options are explicitly mentioned as components of the GHI calculation in the text. Thus, (d) is the only correct option.


**5.  In the context of India's school education system, which initiative uses data from UDISE+ and NAS to classify states/UTs and districts into ten grades, reflecting the performance of the school education system?**

(a)  National Family Health Survey (NFHS)
(b)  Performance Grading Index (PGI)
(c)  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)
(d)  Global Gender Gap Index

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Performance Grading Index (PGI) is specifically designed to assess the performance of India's school education system at both state and district levels.  It leverages data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS).  The other options are irrelevant: NFHS focuses on health, NCF-SE on curriculum framework, and the Global Gender Gap Index on gender equality across various parameters.  The question directly asks for the initiative that uses UDISE+ and NAS data for grading, making (b) the only correct answer.


**6. Which of the following is NOT a key dimension of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as generally understood and promoted by international organizations like the WHO?**

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c)  Quality
(d)  Technological Advancement

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The key dimensions of UHC typically emphasized are accessibility, affordability, and quality of health services.  While technological advancement plays a significant role in improving healthcare delivery, it is not considered a core dimension of UHC itself.  Accessibility refers to whether services are available to everyone, affordability to whether they can be accessed without financial hardship, and quality to whether the services are effective and safe.  Technological advancements support these three dimensions but are not a dimension in themselves. Therefore, (d) is the correct answer.


**7. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, amended the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2022.  Which specific aspect of surrogacy was significantly altered by these amendments?**

(a)  The permissible age of surrogate mothers.
(b)  The allowance of surrogacy for foreign nationals.
(c)  The use of donor gametes in surrogacy procedures.
(d)  The maximum number of surrogacy attempts allowed for a single surrogate mother.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 2024 amendments to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules significantly changed the regulations concerning the use of donor gametes in surrogacy. Previously, the use of donor gametes was largely prohibited.  The amendments introduced conditions under which the use of donor gametes would be permitted, provided at least one gamete is from the intending couple.  The other options were not significantly altered by the 2024 amendments.  Therefore, (c) accurately reflects the key change introduced by the amendments.


**8. Which of the following committees was responsible for recommending reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions in India, leading to the acceptance of proposals by the Ministry of Education?**

(a)  The IAEG-SDGs
(b)  The National Steering Committee (NCF-SE)
(c)  Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee
(d)  The Parliamentary Standing Committee on education, women, children, youth, and sports

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee was specifically tasked with reviewing and recommending reforms to the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in India.  Their recommendations directly led to the Ministry of Education's acceptance of proposals for changes to the accreditation process.  The other committees dealt with different aspects of education, SDGs, or other policy areas.  The question explicitly asks about the committee responsible for HEI accreditation reforms, making (c) the only correct answer.


**9.  Which ministry is the nodal ministry for the implementation of the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme, a revamped version of the Anganwadi Services Scheme, focused on improving the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers?**

(a)  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b)  Ministry of Rural Development
(c)  Ministry of Women and Child Development
(d)  Ministry of Education

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) is the nodal ministry responsible for the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme.  This scheme directly falls under their purview as it aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, which are areas of core focus for the MoWCD.  The other ministries have different primary areas of responsibility. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer.


**10.  The  "Triple Threat Report" released by UNICEF highlights a "triple burden" of WASH-related threats faced by children. Which of the following is NOT a component of this "triple burden"?**

(a)  Insufficient access to basic water and sanitation services.
(b)  High burden of WASH-attributable deaths among children under five.
(c)  High prevalence of malnutrition among children.
(d)  High risk of climate and environmental hazards.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  UNICEF's "Triple Threat Report" focuses on the combined impact of limited WASH access, high WASH-related mortality rates among young children, and the increased risk of climate and environmental hazards affecting children's health and well-being.  While malnutrition is undoubtedly a major concern affecting children's health, it is not explicitly listed as one of the three components of the "triple burden" as defined in the report, making (c) the correct answer.  The other three options are directly mentioned as elements of this "triple threat."


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India's education system and vulnerable groups.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth understanding and knowledge beyond simple factual recall.

**1.  A government initiative aims to saturate Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) households with basic amenities.  Which of the following best describes the primary focus of this initiative?**

(a)  Improving agricultural practices and technology among PVTGs.
(b)  Providing comprehensive healthcare and skill-development programs for PVTGs.
(c)  Ensuring access to fundamental facilities like housing, water, sanitation, education, and healthcare for PVTGs.
(d)  Promoting cultural preservation and language revitalization within PVTG communities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The question refers to PM JANMAN, which explicitly aims to provide basic facilities like safe housing, clean drinking water and sanitation, improved access to education, health, and nutrition to PVTG households and habitations. While (b) is partially true, (c) is more comprehensive and accurately reflects the initiative's core goal. Option (a) focuses too narrowly on agriculture, and (d) addresses a different aspect of tribal welfare.  The program's multi-pronged approach aims to address the most pressing needs of PVTGs by ensuring their access to basic necessities and improving their overall quality of life.  This aligns with the broader goal of reducing socio-economic disparities and promoting inclusive development.


**2. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) in India seeks to achieve which of the following primary objectives?**

(a)  Standardize the curriculum across all educational institutions, irrespective of their type.
(b)  Establish a unified credit system integrating school, higher education, and vocational training.
(c)  Eliminate the need for formal examinations in favor of continuous assessment.
(d)  Increase the number of years required to obtain a bachelor's degree.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCrF's core aim is to create a single, unified framework for accumulating and transferring credits earned through diverse educational pathways (school, higher education, vocational training). Option (a) is incorrect; NCrF doesn't aim to standardize curricula but rather to integrate diverse learning experiences. Option (c) is inaccurate as the framework doesn't eliminate examinations, but allows for the integration of credits earned through various methods.  Option (d) is also incorrect; NCrF doesn't mandate changes to the duration of degree programs. The NCrF's emphasis on credit transfer promotes flexibility and mobility within the education system, allowing individuals to pursue diverse learning paths and acquire skills relevant to their career goals.  This aligns with the broader goals of lifelong learning and skill development emphasized in NEP 2020.


**3.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects the role of the Office of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)?**

(a)  To exclusively focus on providing financial assistance to PwDs.
(b) To solely advocate for the rights of PwDs within the education sector.
(c) To safeguard the rights of PwDs and identify inconsistencies in government policies and programs concerning PwDs.
(d) To exclusively manage government-funded rehabilitation centers for PwDs.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Office of the Chief Commissioner for PwDs is mandated to protect the rights of PwDs and identify any programme/policy at odds with the RPwD Act. Options (a), (b), and (d) are too narrow in scope. The office's responsibilities extend beyond financial assistance, education, or managing specific facilities.  Its crucial function is to act as a watchdog, ensuring that government policies and programs are in line with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and promoting the full inclusion and participation of PwDs in all aspects of society.  This supervisory role is critical in ensuring the effective implementation of disability rights legislation and achieving true inclusion.


**4. The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education in India primarily assesses which of the following?**

(a) The financial resources allocated to each school by the state government.
(b) The infrastructure and facilities available in each school.
(c) The overall performance of the school education system at the state and district levels based on data-driven metrics.
(d) The teacher-student ratio in each school.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PGI assesses the performance of the school education system at both the state and district levels, utilizing data from sources like UDISE+ and NAS.  While (b) and (d) are components of the education system's quality, the PGI is a broader metric incorporating numerous aspects of performance. Option (a) is irrelevant to the PGI's core function. The PGI's data-driven approach allows for objective evaluation and comparison of performance across different states and districts.  This facilitates identification of strengths and weaknesses and informs policy interventions aimed at improving the overall quality of school education. The index helps track progress toward national education goals and ensure accountability within the system.


**5. Which of the following is NOT a key feature of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 concerning higher education?**

(a)  Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
(b)  Introduction of a rigid, centralized curriculum across all universities.
(c)  Aiming for a 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) by 2035.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** NEP 2020 promotes flexibility and diversity in higher education, explicitly *rejecting* a rigid, centralized curriculum. Options (a), (c), and (d) are all explicit features of NEP 2020 for higher education. The policy emphasizes multidisciplinary learning, expansion of access, and the creation of a credit bank system for flexibility. The rejection of a rigid curriculum reflects a move towards more decentralized, context-specific approaches to higher education, allowing institutions to tailor their programs to the needs of their students and the regional context. This approach aims to promote innovation and cater to the diverse learning styles and career aspirations of students.


**6.  The "Caged Parrot" analogy, used by the Supreme Court of India concerning the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), primarily highlights which of the following concerns?**

(a) Lack of adequate funding for CBI operations.
(b) The CBI's operational independence and potential for political influence.
(c) The CBI's excessive reliance on technological surveillance methods.
(d) The CBI's limited jurisdiction in investigating crimes within states.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The "caged parrot" metaphor signifies the CBI's perceived lack of autonomy and susceptibility to external pressures, particularly from the government. Option (a) is not the primary concern; while funding is important, the metaphor focuses on autonomy.  Option (c) and (d) are not the central issues highlighted by the analogy. The metaphor points to a broader concern regarding the integrity and effectiveness of investigations when an investigative body is perceived as being under political control, undermining its ability to conduct impartial and objective inquiries. This raises significant questions about accountability and transparency within the justice system and its impact on the rule of law.


**7.  Which of the following statements regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 is INCORRECT?**

(a) It completely prohibits the employment of individuals for handling human excreta.
(b) It mandates the construction and maintenance of community sanitary latrines.
(c) It provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.
(d) It makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The Act doesn't completely prohibit handling human excreta; it prohibits doing so *without* appropriate protective gear and equipment. Options (b), (c), and (d) are accurate reflections of the Act's provisions. The Act's nuanced approach acknowledges the need for sanitation work while emphasizing the importance of protecting workers' health and safety. The Act's focus on rehabilitation and the provision of alternative employment is crucial in addressing the long-term consequences of manual scavenging and promoting the dignity and well-being of those affected.  The Act's emphasis on the construction of sanitary latrines is a key step in eliminating the underlying causes of manual scavenging.


**8. The De-Notified Tribes (DNTs) in India are primarily characterized by which of the following?**

(a)  Their historical association with specific geographical regions.
(b)  Their traditional occupation as artisans and craftspeople.
(c)  Their historical designation as "criminal tribes" during British rule.
(d)  Their exclusive reliance on agriculture for their livelihood.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** DNTs were historically labeled as "criminal tribes" under British colonial rule. Options (a), (b), and (d) are not defining characteristics of all DNTs.  The historical labeling had lasting negative consequences, leading to marginalization and discrimination. The government's efforts to rehabilitate and empower DNT communities are crucial in addressing the historical injustices and promoting their social and economic inclusion.  Understanding the historical context of DNTs is essential for addressing the complex challenges they face and designing effective policies for their upliftment.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to test various cognitive skills and avoid simple guessing.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  Which of the following accurately describes the core components of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)?**

(a)  A rigid, subject-specific curriculum emphasizing rote learning and standardized testing, with a focus on traditional academic subjects.
(b) A flexible framework promoting interdisciplinary learning, multilingualism, vocational education integrated with academics, and a shift towards competency-based assessment.
(c)  A curriculum solely focused on technological advancements in education, neglecting traditional learning methods and cultural relevance.
(d)  A framework that strictly adheres to the existing four-stage schooling structure, without incorporating any modifications based on age groups.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE, as detailed in the text, aims for a significant transformation of the Indian school education system. It explicitly promotes a flexible, interdisciplinary approach, going beyond traditional subject-based learning.  The emphasis on multilingualism, particularly incorporating at least two Indian languages, is a key component. The integration of vocational education into the academic curriculum, offering diverse learning pathways, is also a defining feature.  Finally, the shift towards competency-based assessment, moving away from solely standardized testing, underscores the framework's focus on holistic development. Option (a) is incorrect because it contradicts the core principles of flexibility and interdisciplinary learning. Option (c) is incorrect as the NCF-SE doesn't solely focus on technology; it aims for a balanced approach. Option (d) is incorrect because the NCF-SE proposes a revised 5+3+3+4 age-based structure, replacing the existing four-stage system.  The NCF-SE's approach aligns with the broader goals of the National Education Policy 2020, aiming for a more inclusive and relevant educational experience.


**2. The Performance Grading Index (PGI) and PGI-D are primarily designed to:**

(a)  Assess the performance of individual students within the school education system.
(b)  Evaluate the financial efficiency and resource allocation of state and district education departments.
(c)  Measure the effectiveness of teacher training programs and professional development initiatives.
(d)  Evaluate the overall performance of school education systems at the state and district levels, utilizing data on outcomes and school infrastructure.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PGI and PGI-D are explicitly designed to assess the performance of school education systems at both state and district levels.  The text clearly states that they utilize data from sources like UDISE+ and NAS, focusing on various aspects of the system's effectiveness.  These indices don't directly evaluate individual student performance (a), financial management (b), or teacher training programs (c), although these factors indirectly influence the overall scores. The PGI's grading system, categorizing states and districts into ten grades based on their performance, highlights its focus on a comprehensive assessment of the educational infrastructure and outcomes. The inclusion of factors like effective classroom transaction and school safety in PGI-D further strengthens this comprehensive assessment.


**3.  Which of the following is NOT a key feature of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 concerning higher education in India?**

(a)  The establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
(b)  A significant reduction in the number of years required for undergraduate degrees.
(c)  The creation of the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) for digital storage of academic credits.
(d)  The promotion of internationalization of education through collaborations and the potential entry of top global universities.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020, as described in the text, actually *increases* the flexibility of undergraduate degree durations, offering both 3-year and 4-year options. The policy aims to provide multiple exit options at various stages, allowing students to obtain certifications, diplomas, or bachelor's degrees depending on their progress and needs.  The other options (a, c, and d) are all accurate representations of the NEP 2020's key features for higher education, including the establishment of MERUs, the creation of the ABC system for credit transfer, and the emphasis on international collaborations to enhance the quality and global reach of Indian higher education.


**4.  The recently released UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, primarily aim to:**

(a)  Restrict the number of institutions that can apply for Deemed to be University (DtbU) status.
(b)  Centralize control over curriculum and course offerings in Deemed to be Universities.
(c)  Encourage universities to prioritize quality, strengthen research, and transform the higher education landscape.
(d)  Eliminate the need for institutions to obtain approval before starting new courses or programs.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The new regulations, as the text explains, aim to improve the quality and excellence of Deemed to be Universities.  The emphasis on strengthening the research ecosystem and transforming the higher education landscape is a central goal.  Option (a) is incorrect because the regulations actually *expand* eligibility, allowing institutions younger than 20 years to apply. Option (b) is incorrect; the regulations don't centralize control but allow for more autonomy within established guidelines.  Option (d) is incorrect as the regulations still require prior approval from the Executive Council and relevant statutory councils for new courses.


**5.  Which of the following organizations released the report "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022"?**

(a)  The International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b)  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  The World Food Programme (WFP)
(d)  The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the UNHCR released the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022" report.  The other organizations, while involved in humanitarian work, are not associated with this specific publication.  The report's focus on forced displacement aligns directly with the UNHCR's mandate of protecting refugees and those forced to flee their homes.  The IOM also works on migration issues but is not mentioned as the source for this particular report.  The WFP and GANHRI focus on different areas, making them unsuitable answers.


**6.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) primarily aims to:**

(a)  Standardize the curriculum across all educational levels in India.
(b)  Create a separate credit system for vocational training, independent of higher education.
(c)  Integrate credits earned through school, higher education, and vocational/skill education, creating a unified framework.
(d)  Eliminate the need for any form of academic credit transfer between institutions.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF, as described, seeks to create a unified and seamless credit system.  Its core objective is to allow for the integration of credits earned across diverse educational and training pathways, fostering flexibility and mobility for learners. Option (a) is incorrect because the NCrF doesn't aim for curriculum standardization but rather credit integration. Option (b) is incorrect because the NCrF aims for integration, not separation. Option (d) is incorrect because the NCrF explicitly facilitates credit transfer.


**7. The  "India Ageing Report 2023" was released by:**

(a)  The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  The UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(c)  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
(d)  The World Health Organization (WHO)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly attributes the release of the "India Ageing Report 2023" to the UNFPA, in collaboration with IIPS. The UNFPA's focus on population dynamics and reproductive health makes its involvement logical.  UNDESA, UNCPD, and WHO, while dealing with related issues, are not mentioned as the sources of this specific report.


**8.  Which of the following statements about the Global Food Policy Report 2023 is accurate?**

(a) It highlighted a significant decrease in global food insecurity in recent years.
(b) It was primarily focused on the impact of climate change on agricultural production in developed nations.
(c) It emphasized the rise in food insecurity due to multiple crises, including conflict and climate change.
(d) It concluded that food price increases in 2021-22 were primarily due to increased domestic demand.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that the Global Food Policy Report 2023 highlighted the increase in global food insecurity due to multiple factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, natural disasters, and political instability. Option (a) is incorrect as the report indicates a rise, not a decrease, in food insecurity. Option (b) is incorrect because the report's scope is global, encompassing both developed and developing nations. Option (d) is incorrect; the report attributed the price surge to supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war.


**9.  The  Paris Principles are primarily associated with:**

(a)  The establishment of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(b)  The accreditation of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) by GANHRI
(c)  The implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(d)  The functioning of the World Food Programme (WFP)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text directly links the Paris Principles to the accreditation process of NHRIs by GANHRI.  These principles provide standards for the establishment and operation of NHRIs globally. The other options are not directly connected to the Paris Principles.  The UNPFII, UNCRC, and WFP operate under different frameworks and mandates.


**10.  Which ministry is the nodal ministry for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes in India?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Panchayati Raj


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes in India.  The other ministries have roles in related areas but do not have the primary responsibility for Scheduled Tribe welfare.


**1.  A government initiative aims to improve the research capacity of Indian universities and mitigate gender disparity in science and engineering research funding.  Which initiative best fits this description?**

(a) IMPRINT India
(b) FIST Scheme
(c) PURSE
(d) SERB-POWER

**Explanation:**

The Promotion of University Research and Scientific Excellence (PURSE) scheme is a Department of Science & Technology (DST) initiative specifically designed to strengthen the research capabilities of performing Indian universities.  While other options address research and innovation, PURSE directly targets university research capacity building.  IMPRINT India focuses on public-private partnerships for research projects, and the Fund for Improvement of S&T Infrastructure (FIST) scheme provides basic infrastructure support. SERB-POWER, while addressing gender disparity, is more narrowly focused on women in exploratory research, not the broader research capacity of universities.  Therefore, PURSE most accurately reflects the description provided in the question.


**2. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) integrates credits earned through various educational pathways. Which of the following frameworks is NOT directly incorporated into the NCrF?**

(a) National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(b) National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(c) National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) / National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF)
(d)  Global Indicator Framework (GIF)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF explicitly integrates the NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF-SE/NSEQF to create a unified credit system across higher education, vocational training, and school education. The Global Indicator Framework (GIF), while relevant to broader educational goals and data collection, is not a framework for credit accumulation and transfer within the Indian education system.  The GIF is a global standard for measuring progress towards Sustainable Development Goals, not a domestic framework for integrating educational credits.  Therefore, the GIF is the only option not directly incorporated into the NCrF.


**3.  A report assesses the performance of school education systems at the state and district levels, using data from UDISE+ and NAS.  What is this report called?**

(a)  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) report
(b)  National Family Health Survey (NFHS) report
(c) Performance Grading Index (PGI) and PGI for Districts (PGI-D)
(d)  Global Hunger Index (GHI) report

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Performance Grading Index (PGI) and its district-level counterpart, PGI-D, are specifically designed to assess the performance of school education systems at state and district levels.  These reports utilize data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS).  The other options relate to different aspects of education, health, and nutrition, but not to the direct assessment of school system performance at the state and district levels as described in the question.


**4. Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023, collaborating with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)?**

(a) UNDESA
(b) UNHCR
(c) UNFPA
(d) IFPRI

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) collaborated with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) to release the India Ageing Report 2023.  The other organizations mentioned, UNDESA, UNHCR, and IFPRI, focus on different areas, such as sustainable development, refugee affairs, and food policy research respectively.  The question specifically asks about the organization involved in releasing a report related to aging in India, and only the UNFPA fits this description.


**5. Which act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, impacting the lives of Denotified Tribes (DNTs)?**

(a) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(b) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(c) The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Habitual Offenders Act of 1952 repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871. The Criminal Tribes Act was a discriminatory law that labelled certain communities as "criminal by birth," impacting their social standing and opportunities.  The other acts mentioned address different social issues, including domestic violence, atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and surrogacy regulation, but not the specific repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.


**6. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices and prevent deaths among which group of workers?**

(a)  Anganwadi workers
(b)  Teachers
(c)  Manual scavengers
(d)  Healthcare workers

(a)  The Mandal Commission
(b)  The Idate Commission
(c)  The Dhebar Commission
(d)  The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Education accepted the recommendations of the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee regarding reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions.  The other commissions mentioned focused on different areas, including backward classes, tribal welfare, and Denotified Tribes.  The question specifically asks about the committee whose recommendations were adopted for HEI accreditation reform, and only the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee fits this description.


**8.  Which organization released the report titled ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022’?**

(a)  UNFPA
(b)  IFPRI
(c)  UNHCR
(d)  UNDESA

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) released the report titled ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022.’ This report documents global trends in forced displacement, including refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons.  The other organizations mentioned focus on different areas, such as population trends, food policy, and sustainable development. The question specifically asks for the organization that released the report on forced displacement, and only the UNHCR fits this description.


**9.  The  National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs aligns with which global framework?**

(a) Global Gender Gap Index
(b) Global Hunger Index
(c) Global Indicator Framework (GIF)
(d) Gender Social Norms Index

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in India directly aligns with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF). The GIF provides a set of global indicators for monitoring progress towards the SDGs, and the NIF adapts these indicators to the Indian context, adding indicators specific to India's needs.  The other options are related to different global indices, but not to the specific framework for monitoring SDG progress.

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c) Quality
(d)  Sustainability of healthcare infrastructure

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While sustainability of healthcare infrastructure is crucial for achieving UHC, it's not considered one of the three primary dimensions of UHC. The core dimensions are accessibility (ensuring everyone can reach services), affordability (services are financially accessible), and quality (services are effective and safe).  Sustainability is important for the long-term success of UHC, but it's a supporting factor rather than a core dimension.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.  The difficulty level is assessed as "difficult" due to the nuanced nature of the information and the need for precise recall and analysis.


**1.  A village maintains its Open Defecation Free (ODF) status and has implemented comprehensive waste management systems, including visual cleanliness initiatives and public awareness campaigns. Which designation accurately reflects this village's status?**

(a) ODF-Sustained Village
(b) ODF Plus Village
(c) ODF Plus Model Village
(d)  Clean and Green Village


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes a village that meets all the criteria for an "ODF Plus Model Village."  Option (b), "ODF Plus Village," is partially correct as it fulfills the ODF status and waste management, but it lacks the additional elements of visual cleanliness and IEC messaging that define the "model" status. Option (a) is too general, and (d) is not a recognized official designation within the context of the Swachh Bharat Mission.  The "ODF Plus Model Village" signifies a higher level of achievement, incorporating not just functional sanitation but also a broader commitment to environmental cleanliness and community engagement, aligning with the holistic approach expected in governance and development initiatives.  Understanding the nuances between different ODF classifications is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of rural sanitation programs.


**2.  The India Ageing Report 2023, highlighting demographic trends such as the total fertility rate and life expectancy, was released by which organization?**

(a)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(b)  International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  World Health Organization (WHO)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UNFPA, in collaboration with the IIPS, released the India Ageing Report 2023. While the IIPS is involved, the UNFPA is the primary releasing agency.  The UNDP focuses on broader development goals, and the WHO concentrates on health aspects. The report's focus on population aging, fertility rates, and life expectancy falls directly under the UNFPA's mandate of ensuring sexual and reproductive health. Understanding the roles of different UN agencies is crucial for analyzing international development reports and their implications for national policies.  The accurate identification of the releasing organization demonstrates a grasp of international organizations and their specific areas of expertise.


**3. Which UN body issued guidance on children's rights to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment for the first time?**

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(c)  UN Committee on Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(d)  World Food Programme (WFP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UNCRC, for the first time, issued guidance on children's rights concerning environmental sustainability.  This highlights the evolving understanding of children's rights to include environmental well-being.  The UNDESA focuses on broader sustainable development goals; the UNCPD deals with population and development issues; and the WFP addresses food security.  The UNCRC's action demonstrates a growing awareness of the interconnectedness of human rights and environmental protection, a key theme in contemporary global governance.  Knowing which UN body issued this specific guidance shows an understanding of the specialized mandates of various UN organizations and their impact on international human rights frameworks.


**4. The Global Food Policy Report 2023, which analyzed the impact of multiple crises on food insecurity, was published by which research institution?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The IFPRI, a major research center within the CGIAR system, released the Global Food Policy Report 2023.

The report's in-depth analysis of food policy and its relation to global crises falls squarely under IFPRI's mandate of providing research-based policy solutions.  Correctly identifying the author of this report demonstrates an understanding of key research institutions' contributions to global food security policy debates.


**5.  Which index measures the status of women's empowerment and gender equality across the world using two distinct indices: the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI)?**

(a) Global Gender Gap Index
(b) Gender Social Norms Index
(c) UHC Service Coverage Index
(d) Path to Equal Report


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Path to Equal Report, jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP, uses both the WEI and GGPI.  The Global Gender Gap Index uses different parameters, the Gender Social Norms Index focuses on social norms, and the UHC Service Coverage Index measures health coverage.  The Path to Equal Report's dual-index approach provides a more comprehensive assessment of gender equality, moving beyond simple comparisons of men and women to a more nuanced evaluation of women's agency and opportunities.  Recognizing this unique feature of the report indicates an advanced understanding of gender equality measurement frameworks.


**6. The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in India was developed by which Ministry?**

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)
(c) NITI Aayog
(d) Ministry of External Affairs


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The MoSPI developed the NIF for SDGs in India.  The other ministries have roles in implementing SDG-related programs but not in developing the overarching NIF. The NIF’s creation falls under MoSPI’s responsibility for collecting and disseminating national statistics, making it a crucial tool for monitoring India's progress towards the SDGs.  Understanding the role of MoSPI in this context demonstrates an awareness of the importance of data and statistics in policymaking and international development cooperation.

(a)  Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
(b)  United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)
(c)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d)  Amnesty International


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** GANHRI reviews and accredits NHRIs based on the Paris Principles.  The OHCHR and UNHRC are involved in human rights protection but don't directly accredit NHRIs. Amnesty International is a non-governmental organization. GANHRI's role in accreditation establishes standards and promotes best practices for human rights institutions globally.  Understanding GANHRI's function demonstrates knowledge of international mechanisms for promoting and protecting human rights.

(c)  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)
(d)  Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The SRMS specifically targets the rehabilitation of manual scavengers. While other schemes might indirectly benefit them, the SRMS is directly focused on providing financial and skill-building support for this vulnerable group.  Understanding the specific mandate of this scheme demonstrates an awareness of government efforts to address caste-based discrimination and social inequalities.


**9.  The  "Triple Threat" report, which highlights the combined challenges of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) for children, was published by which organization?**

(a) World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) UNICEF
(c) World Bank
(d) WaterAid


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** UNICEF published the "Triple Threat" report on WASH challenges for children.  While WHO and the World Bank are involved in WASH-related work, UNICEF is the primary organization that focuses on the holistic well-being of children, including their access to safe water and sanitation.  The report's focus on the combined threats of WASH demonstrates an understanding of the interconnectedness of these issues and their impact on child health and development.

**Explanation:**

The Intensified Mission Indradhanush specifically targets children aged 0-5 years and pregnant women who have missed any vaccine doses.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on broader health interventions across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission aims to improve healthcare access through technology.  The National Health Policy 2017 sets a broader vision for Universal Health Coverage (UHC), but doesn't directly address the specific issue of missed vaccine doses in the same targeted manner as Mission Indradhanush.  The other options are related to broader health goals, but Mission Indradhanush is uniquely focused on this particular aspect of immunization coverage.  Therefore, (d) is the only accurate and precise answer.


**2.  The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed as Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, is primarily under the purview of which ministry?**

(a) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(d) Ministry of Education

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the Anganwadi Services Scheme falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD). While the scheme's objectives relate to health and nutrition, impacting areas overseen by other ministries, its administrative control rests with the MoWCD.  The other options are involved in related areas, but not the primary administrative body for this specific scheme.  The question tests factual recall of the scheme's administrative ministry.


**3.  Which of the following applications is used by Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) for efficient service delivery and monitoring of nutrition programs, including the identification of malnutrition prevalence among children?**

(a) eShram Portal
(b) CARINGS portal
(c) Poshan Tracker
(d) ICDS-CAS

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly describes "Poshan Tracker" as a mobile application used by AWWs for efficient service delivery and monitoring, including the identification of stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence. While ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) also plays a role in data capture, Poshan Tracker is specifically mentioned as the application for dynamic identification and last-mile tracking of nutrition service delivery.  eShram is for unorganized workers, and CARINGS is related to child adoption.  This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the specific application used for nutrition monitoring.


**4.  According to the provided text, which of the following is NOT a key feature of the Anganwadi system?**

(a)  It's a global frontrunner in early childhood care.
(b) AWWs and AWHs receive a fixed monthly honorarium.
(c) It is solely focused on children aged 0-6 years.
(d)  It aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the Anganwadi system's primary focus is on children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, the Saksham Anganwadi initiative expands its scope to include adolescent girls (14-18 years) in aspirational districts and the North Eastern Region (NER).  The other options accurately reflect aspects of the Anganwadi system as described in the text. The question tests understanding of the scope and limitations of the Anganwadi program, requiring careful reading of the details provided.


**5.  The 'Triple Threat' report, released by UNICEF, examines which interconnected challenges related to children's well-being?**

(a)  Malnutrition, lack of education, and inadequate healthcare.
(b)  Limited access to basic water and sanitation services, high mortality due to unsafe WASH, and high risk from climate hazards.
(c)  Child labor, child marriage, and child trafficking.
(d)  Open defecation, lack of hygiene, and poor sanitation.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly defines the 'Triple Threat' as less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation, the highest burden of WASH-related deaths among children under 5 (among top 20 countries), and the highest risk of climate and environmental hazards (among top 25%). The other options, while important child welfare issues, are not the specific focus of the UNICEF report as described. This question assesses understanding of a specific report and its key findings.


**6.  Which two organizations jointly released the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 report?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP) and International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(b)  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
(c)  UNICEF and World Bank
(d)  UNHCR and UNDESA

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly names Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe as the organizations responsible for releasing the GHI 2023 report.  The other options are involved in related areas but are not the publishers of this specific report.  This question tests factual recall of the organizations involved in producing a specific report.


**7.  In the context of the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, India's ranking and categorization are:**

(a) Ranked 100th, categorized as "moderate"
(b) Ranked 125th, categorized as "serious"
(c) Ranked 111th, categorized as "serious"
(d) Ranked 50th, categorized as "low"

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that India is ranked 111th out of 125 countries and categorized as "serious" on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale. The other options present incorrect rankings and categorizations. This question directly tests factual recall of the GHI report's findings for India.


**8.  The 2023 Global Trends report on forced displacement was released by which organization?**

(a) UNDESA
(b) UNHCR
(c) UNFPA
(d) UNCRC

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) is explicitly named as the releaser of the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report."  The other organizations focus on different aspects of global development and human rights.  This question tests the knowledge of which organization publishes a particular report.


**9.  Which of the following best describes the "ODF Plus" status for villages under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)?**

(a)  Complete elimination of open defecation.
(b)  Sustained ODF status with arrangements for either solid or liquid waste management.
(c)  Sustained ODF status with arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, plus visual cleanliness and IEC messaging.
(d)  Construction of community sanitary latrines.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text clearly defines ODF Plus as including sustained ODF status, arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and ODF Plus IEC (Information, Education, and Communication) messages. Option (a) only describes the basic ODF status, while (b) describes a less comprehensive version of ODF Plus.  Option (d) is a component of achieving ODF, not its 'Plus' status.  This question tests the understanding of a specific terminology and its definition.


**10. Which of the following is NOT a key dimension of Universal Health Coverage (UHC)?**

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c) Availability
(d) Quality

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions Accessibility, Affordability, and Quality as key dimensions of UHC. While availability of services is crucial for UHC, it is not explicitly listed as a primary dimension in the text. Accessibility refers to the ease of reaching healthcare services, affordability to the financial burden on individuals, and quality to the standards of care provided.  This question tests the understanding of core concepts within the UHC framework.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and tests various cognitive skills, with detailed explanations provided.

**1.  A national protocol was recently launched to track and assist children with disabilities.  This initiative is aligned with which broader national program focusing on nutrition and child development?**

(a)  National Rural Health Mission
(b)  National Health Policy 2017
(c)  POSHAN Abhiyan
(d)  Intensified Mission Indradhanush

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the national Anganwadi protocol for Divyang children, explicitly stating its alignment with the POSHAN Abhiyan.  POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) is a flagship program of the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) focusing on improving nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  While the other options relate to health and child welfare, they don't directly encompass the specific initiative described in the question. The National Rural Health Mission focuses on rural healthcare, the National Health Policy 2017 addresses broader health goals, and Intensified Mission Indradhanush is a vaccination program.  The Anganwadi protocol's emphasis on inclusive care and its three-step approach directly falls under the umbrella of POSHAN Abhiyan's goals of improving nutrition and child development.


**2. The "Triple Threat Report" by UNICEF highlights a critical challenge related to the health and well-being of children.  Which of the following best describes this "triple threat"?**

(a)  High rates of child mortality, malnutrition, and lack of access to education.
(b)  Inadequate access to basic water and sanitation services, high child mortality due to unsafe WASH, and high risk of climate and environmental hazards.
(c)  Prevalence of child labor, child marriage, and school dropouts.
(d)  High incidence of infectious diseases, malnutrition, and lack of access to healthcare.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNICEF "Triple Threat Report" specifically focuses on the combined risks of inadequate WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) services. The report highlights three interconnected factors: less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation services, the highest burden of deaths attributable to unsafe WASH among children under 5 (within the top 20 countries), and a high risk of climate and environmental hazards (within the top 25% of countries). Options (a), (c), and (d) address important child health issues, but they do not represent the specific combination of factors identified in the "Triple Threat Report."  The report's unique contribution is the linking of WASH-related issues with climate vulnerability, creating a complex, multi-faceted challenge.


**3. Which government scheme aims to provide social security to small and marginal farmers through a voluntary contributory pension plan?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G)
(b) Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY)
(c) Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY)
(d) Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY) is specifically designed to provide a social security net for small and marginal farmers.  It's a voluntary pension scheme where farmers contribute a small amount monthly, with the government matching the contribution.  The other options address different sectors: PMAY-G focuses on rural housing, AB PM-JAY on health insurance, and PMMSY on fisheries development.  Understanding the specific focus of each scheme is crucial for distinguishing PM-KMY's unique role in providing pension benefits to a vulnerable farmer population.


**4.  The Anganwadi system, a cornerstone of India's Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), receives financial support through which type of government scheme?**

(a)  A centrally sponsored scheme
(b)  A state-sponsored scheme
(c)  A privately funded initiative
(d)  A purely locally funded initiative

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the Anganwadi Services Scheme (now Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD).  Centrally sponsored schemes involve financial participation from both the central and state governments, but the central government plays a major role in funding and policy direction.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect, as the scheme's primary funding source is the central government.


**5.  Which organization released the 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report, highlighting concerns about hunger levels in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa?**

(a)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c)  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 report was released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, two non-governmental organizations based in Ireland and Germany respectively. While the other organizations (WHO, UNDP, and IFPRI) also work on issues related to hunger and development, they were not responsible for releasing this specific report.  Understanding the authorship of key reports like the GHI is essential for analyzing the perspectives and methodologies employed in assessing global hunger.


**6. The Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 collected a large amount of data.  Which aspect of this data was *not* finalized and published in 2016?**

(a)  Household assets
(b)  Occupation
(c)  Caste data
(d)  Housing conditions

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the SECC 2011 data, *excluding* caste data, was finalized and published in 2016.  The SECC collected extensive data on various socio-economic characteristics of households, including assets, occupation, and housing conditions. However, the caste-based information collected as part of the census remained unpublished. This highlights the complexities and sensitivities surrounding caste data collection and analysis in India.


**7.  Which Act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a piece of legislation that had stigmatized certain communities?**

(a)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b)  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(c)  The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d)  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952.  While the other acts address important social justice issues, they do not relate to the specific repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.  Understanding the historical context of discriminatory legislation and the subsequent efforts to redress past injustices is crucial for comprehending current social issues.


**8.  Which government initiative aims to provide a centralized, streamlined platform to enhance collaboration within India's startup ecosystem?**

(a)  Mission Mausam
(b)  BHASKAR initiative
(c)  ONDC's Saarthi application
(d)  NPS Vatsalya scheme

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The BHASKAR initiative, under the Startup India program, is specifically designed to create a central digital platform for startups, investors, mentors, and government agencies to connect and collaborate.  The other options address different areas: Mission Mausam focuses on meteorological research, ONDC's Saarthi on multilingual buyer apps, and NPS Vatsalya on children's pension plans.  Recognizing the specific goals and functions of each initiative is key to understanding the government's efforts to support various sectors.


**9.  What is the primary objective of the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)?**

(a)  To improve rural housing infrastructure.
(b)  To promote sustainable development in the fisheries sector.
(c)  To enhance access to healthcare services.
(d)  To provide financial assistance for skill development programs.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the primary objective of PMMSY is to promote the sustainable and responsible development of the fisheries sector and bring about a "Blue Revolution." The other options describe the goals of other government schemes.  Understanding the specific focus of different government programs is crucial for analyzing their impact on various sectors of the economy and society.


**10. The  "National Credit Framework (NCrF)" seeks to integrate credits earned through different educational pathways.  Which of the following is NOT a component of this framework?**

(a) National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(b) National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(c)  National Curriculum Framework for Higher Education (NCF-HE)
(d) National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF explicitly integrates NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF to create a seamless credit transfer system across school education, higher education, and vocational training.  There is no mention of a "National Curriculum Framework for Higher Education" (NCF-HE) within the description of NCrF.  The other options are correctly identified as components of the integrated credit framework.  This question tests the understanding of the structure and components of the NCrF.


**1.  Concerning the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), which assertion is inaccurate?**

(a) ABDM strives to construct a comprehensive digital health infrastructure ensuring universal health coverage via an integrated ecosystem.
(b) Under ABDM, each citizen receives a unique Health ID acting as a repository for individual health records.
(c) ABDM encompasses solely public healthcare facilities, excluding private providers.
(d) ABDM aims to improve equitable access to quality healthcare by encouraging the use of technologies such as telemedicine and enabling national portability of health services.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c).  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) is explicitly designed to be inclusive of both public and private healthcare providers.  Its goal is to create a unified digital health ecosystem, not one limited to the public sector. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect the ABDM's objectives and functionalities.  (a) highlights the mission's aim for universal health coverage through digital infrastructure. (b) correctly describes the unique Health ID system. (d) accurately points out the use of technology like telemedicine to enhance access and portability.  Option (c)'s exclusion of private healthcare providers is fundamentally untrue to the ABDM's inclusive approach.  The integration of public and private sectors is crucial for the mission's success in achieving universal health coverage.


**2.  Which of the following is NOT a key dimension of Universal Health Coverage (UHC)?**

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c) Availability
(d) Quality

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). While availability of healthcare services is a significant factor contributing to UHC, it is not considered one of the *key* dimensions.  Accessibility, affordability, and quality are the core pillars of UHC.  Accessibility focuses on whether individuals can physically reach healthcare services. Affordability ensures these services are financially feasible for everyone. Quality emphasizes the standard of care provided.  Availability, while important, is subsumed within accessibility (physical access) and affordability (financial access). The three key dimensions are interconnected;  even if services are available, they are meaningless without accessibility and affordability, and ultimately their value depends on their quality.


**3.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative primarily focuses on which of the following?**

(a) Strengthening and upgrading Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) to enhance efficiency.
(b) Providing financial assistance to AWWs and AWHs for personal expenses.
(c) Implementing a nationwide program for adult literacy.
(d) Promoting traditional methods of childcare.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a). Saksham Anganwadis is a targeted intervention aimed at improving AWCs.  The core objective is to strengthen, upgrade, and rejuvenate these centers nationwide to boost their overall effectiveness in delivering services. Option (b) is partially true, as Saksham Anganwadis does involve enhanced compensation for AWWs and AWHs, but this is secondary to the primary goal of upgrading the centers themselves.  Option (c) is incorrect as Saksham Anganwadi does not focus on adult literacy. Option (d) is incorrect; the program is forward-looking and employs modern technologies and methods.  The focus on infrastructure and technology is key to Saksham Anganwadis' vision of efficient service delivery.


**4.  Which statement regarding the Anganwadi system is NOT accurate?**

(a) It's a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD).
(b) Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium.
(c) The primary objective is to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-18 years, pregnant women and lactating mothers.
(d) The system uses digital tools like the 'Poshan Tracker' for efficient service delivery.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). While improving the nutritional and health status of pregnant women and lactating mothers is a key goal, the Anganwadi system primarily focuses on children aged 0-6 years.  The age range mentioned in option (c) is incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all accurate representations of the Anganwadi system. (a) correctly identifies the sponsoring ministry and scheme type. (b) accurately describes the compensation structure for AWWs and AWHs. (d) correctly points out the use of digital tools for monitoring and tracking.  The focus on children aged 0-6 years is critical because this is the period of most rapid growth and development, and therefore the period where nutritional and health interventions have the greatest impact.


**5.  The "Triple Threat" report by UNICEF highlights which interconnected challenges related to children?**

(a)  Inadequate access to basic water and sanitation services, a high burden of WASH-related deaths among children under five, and high risk of climate and environmental hazards.
(b)  High rates of child malnutrition, lack of access to quality education, and widespread child labor.
(c)  Inadequate healthcare, limited access to clean water, and high rates of infectious diseases.
(d)  Child trafficking, child abuse, and lack of legal protection for children.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a).  UNICEF's "Triple Threat" report specifically focuses on the convergence of three WASH-related threats: limited access to basic water and sanitation, a disproportionately high burden of WASH-attributable deaths among children under five, and elevated risk from climate and environmental hazards. These three factors are interconnected and exacerbate each other, creating a particularly challenging situation for children's health and well-being. Options (b), (c), and (d) are important child welfare issues, but they are not the specific focus of the "Triple Threat" report, which is specifically about the combination of water, sanitation, hygiene, and environmental vulnerabilities.


**6. According to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, which of the following statements about India is INCORRECT?**

(a) India’s GHI score showed a slight improvement compared to 2015.
(b) India ranked among the top 20 countries with the highest burden of deaths attributable to unsafe WASH among children under 5.
(c) India is categorized as having a “Serious” level of hunger on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale.
(d)  India's GHI score in 2023 was 28.7.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). While India faces significant challenges related to child mortality and malnutrition, the GHI report does not specifically place it among the top 20 countries with the highest burden of WASH-related deaths among children under five.  That statistic is related to a different UNICEF report. Options (a), (c), and (d) accurately reflect findings from the GHI 2023 report regarding India's ranking, hunger severity level, and specific score.  The GHI focuses on undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality as key indicators of hunger.  The inclusion of the WASH-related death statistic as a fact about India in option (b) is incorrect in the context of the GHI report.


**7.  Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023?**

(a)  The World Bank
(b)  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
(c)  The World Health Organization (WHO)
(d)  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). The India Ageing Report 2023 was a joint publication of the UNFPA and IIPS.  The UNFPA's mandate includes work on population dynamics and aging, making this collaboration a logical fit.  The other organizations, while involved in related areas of development, did not release this specific report.  The report provides valuable data and analysis on the demographic shifts related to India's aging population, offering insights into the challenges and opportunities this presents. The joint authorship highlights the collaborative nature of research on such complex demographic issues.


**8. The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan primarily aims to:**

(a)  Improve the literacy rates among women in rural areas.
(b)  Reduce stunting in identified districts with the highest malnutrition burden.
(c)  Increase agricultural productivity in drought-prone regions.
(d)  Promote traditional healthcare practices in underserved communities.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  POSHAN Abhiyan's central focus is on reducing stunting, a major indicator of malnutrition, in high-burden districts.  The initiative targets improvements in the utilization of Anganwadi Services to achieve this goal.  Options (a), (c), and (d) address important development areas, but they are not the primary objectives of POSHAN Abhiyan.  The initiative's emphasis on reducing stunting reflects a strategic approach to tackling malnutrition at its root cause and contributing to the overall health and development of children.  The program's emphasis on specific districts demonstrates a targeted and data-driven approach.


**9.  Which of the following is NOT a key role of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)?**

(a) Providing early childhood care and development.
(b) Conducting medical checkups and administering vaccinations.
(c) Creating awareness about health and nutrition.
(d) Monitoring and tracking the nutritional status of children using digital tools.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). While AWWs play a crucial role in promoting health and nutrition, they do not typically conduct medical checkups or administer vaccinations. This is the domain of trained healthcare professionals like Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs).  Options (a), (c), and (d) accurately reflect key aspects of an AWW's responsibilities. (a) highlights their involvement in early childhood care. (c) emphasizes their role in health education. (d) points to their use of digital tools for monitoring children's nutritional status.  The distinction between the roles of AWWs and ANMs is crucial for understanding the division of labor in the integrated child development services (ICDS) system.


**10. Which act governs the adoption of orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered children in India?**

(a) The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956
(b) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c) The Special Marriage Act, 1954
(d) The Guardians and Wards Act, 1890

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, along with its associated regulations, is the primary legislation governing the adoption of children who are orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered in India. While the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, deals with adoption within the Hindu community, the JJ Act has a broader scope, covering inter-country and intra-country adoptions and addressing the needs of all children in need of care and protection.  The other acts mentioned are not primarily focused on child adoption.  The JJ Act's comprehensive approach aims to ensure the best interests of the child are prioritized throughout the adoption process.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and careful analysis.  The difficulty level is primarily "difficult," achieved through nuanced options and demanding conceptual understanding.


**1.  A recent Supreme Court ruling addressed a specific medical condition impacting a woman's ability to conceive naturally.  This condition, which necessitated the use of donor gametes in a surrogacy procedure, is:**

(a) Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
(b) Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) Syndrome
(c) Endometriosis
(d) Tubal Factor Infertility


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly mentions the Supreme Court case *Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India*, which specifically addressed a woman with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) Syndrome.  MRKH is a rare congenital disorder affecting the female reproductive system, causing absolute uterine factor infertility.  While PCOS, endometriosis, and tubal factor infertility are all conditions that can impact fertility, the Supreme Court case directly involved MRKH syndrome.  The other options are plausible distractors for someone with general knowledge of female reproductive health issues but are not the specific condition highlighted in the provided text.  The question tests factual recall of a specific case and its connection to a particular medical condition, demonstrating an understanding of the intersection of law and healthcare.


**2.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced a significant change regarding the use of donor gametes in surrogacy procedures. This change primarily involves:**

(a) A complete ban on the use of donor gametes.
(b) Allowing donor gametes only if the intending couple are infertile due to factors other than gamete issues.
(c) Permitting donor gametes only if at least one gamete from the intending couple is used.
(d)  Restricting the use of donor gametes to cases involving severe genetic disorders.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The rules amended Rule 7 of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2022, which previously prohibited the use of donor gametes. The amendment now allows their use, provided that at least one gamete originates from the intending couple.  Option (a) is incorrect as it contradicts the amendment. Option (b) is too broad; the amendment doesn't specify infertility reasons beyond the necessity of donor gametes. Option (d) is overly restrictive; the amendment doesn't limit donor gamete use to only genetic disorders.  This question tests the understanding of a specific legal amendment and its implications on healthcare practices, requiring careful reading and interpretation of the regulatory changes.


**3.  The National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) Report provides crucial data on various health indicators.  Which of the following is NOT a direct area of focus within the NFHS-5 framework, as indicated in the text?**

(a) Maternal mortality rates
(b) Prevalence of stunting in children
(c) Access to sanitation facilities
(d)  Total fertility rate


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** While NFHS-5 likely touches upon sanitation indirectly as it relates to overall health and well-being,  the passage does not explicitly mention access to sanitation facilities as a direct area of focus within the NFHS-5 report itself. The other three options (maternal mortality rates, prevalence of stunting, and total fertility rate) are standard key indicators directly measured and reported by the NFHS surveys.  The question tests the ability to differentiate between directly mentioned data points and related but indirectly inferred information, requiring a precise understanding of the report's scope.


**4.  The Anganwadi system, a crucial component of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme, aims to primarily improve which of the following aspects?**

(a)  Adult literacy rates in rural areas.
(b)  Access to higher education for marginalized communities.
(c) The nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
(d)  Skill development programs for adolescents.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the primary objectives of the Anganwadi Services Scheme are to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and to reduce mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition. While the Anganwadi system may indirectly contribute to the other options, these are not its primary aims.  The question tests the ability to isolate the core objective of a specific government program from its broader societal impacts, requiring a precise understanding of the program's mandate.


**5.  The "ODF Plus" model village initiative, under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), goes beyond the basic Open Defecation Free (ODF) status by incorporating which additional key element?**

(a)  Increased funding for rural development projects.
(b)  Improved access to clean drinking water sources.
(c)  Arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, along with visual cleanliness.
(d)  Expansion of rural electrification programs.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly defines the "ODF Plus Model village" as one that sustains ODF status, has arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, maintains visual cleanliness (minimal litter, stagnant wastewater, plastic waste), and displays ODF Plus IEC messages. Options (a), (b), and (d) are related to rural development but are not defining characteristics of the ODF Plus model.  The question tests the understanding of a specific government initiative and its multifaceted approach to sanitation, requiring the ability to interpret a detailed definition.


**6.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, uses several key indicators to assess hunger levels.  Which of the following is NOT a primary indicator used in the GHI calculation, as mentioned in the provided text?**

(a) Undernourishment
(b) Child stunting
(c)  Prevalence of infectious diseases
(d) Child wasting


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly lists undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality as the indicators used in the GHI calculation. While infectious diseases undoubtedly impact hunger and malnutrition, they are not directly included as primary indicators in the GHI methodology as detailed in the passage.  This question tests the ability to identify the precise components of a specific index, requiring close attention to detail and a precise understanding of its methodology.


**7.  The  "Triple Threat Report" by UNICEF highlights a complex challenge related to children's well-being. This "triple threat" refers to a combination of factors involving:**

(a)  Poverty, lack of education, and inadequate healthcare.
(b)  Limited access to basic water and sanitation services, high mortality rates from unsafe WASH, and high risk from climate and environmental hazards.
(c)  Malnutrition, child labour, and lack of access to quality education.
(d)  Domestic violence, child abuse, and neglect.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage defines the "triple threat" as less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation services, a high burden of WASH-related deaths among children under 5 (among the top 20 countries), and high risk from climate and environmental hazards (among the top 25%).  The other options, while concerning, do not represent the specific "triple threat" framework described in the text.  The question tests the ability to recall and understand a specific report's framework, requiring precise knowledge of the named report and its key concept.


**8. The National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, established a new organization to provide strategic direction for research and innovation in India.  Which of the following ministries is the administrative department for the NRF, as stated in the text?**

(a) Ministry of Education
(b) Ministry of Science and Technology
(c) Department of Science and Technology
(d) NITI Aayog


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Department of Science and Technology (DST) will be the administrative department of the NRF. While the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Science and Technology are involved in the governance of the NRF, the DST is identified as the responsible administrative department.  NITI Aayog plays a consultative role but isn't the administrative body. This question tests factual recall of a specific administrative arrangement, requiring precise knowledge of government organizational structure.


**9.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) proposes a significant restructuring of the school education system. Which of the following age-based structures does the NCF-SE adopt for schooling?**

(a) 4+4+4 structure
(b) 5+3+3+4 structure
(c) 6+3+3+4 structure
(d) 5+4+3+4 structure


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the NCF-SE adopts a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, aligning with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The other options are incorrect as they don't reflect the specific structure mentioned in the provided text. This question tests factual recall of a specific curricular structure.


**10. The  "India Rankings 2023" of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs), released by the Ministry of Education, introduced a significant change. Which of the following best describes this change?**

(a) The inclusion of only private universities in the ranking system.
(b) The removal of all engineering colleges from the ranking process.
(c) The integration of "Innovation" ranking previously conducted separately by ARIIA into the India Rankings.
(d) The complete abolition of the NIRF ranking system.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

These questions aim to assess a deep understanding of the provided text, requiring more than just superficial knowledge of the topics.  They demand precise recall, analysis, and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring precise factual recall and conceptual understanding.


**1.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is associated with which of the following global partnerships?**

(a) The World Bank's Sustainable Development Goals initiative.
(b) The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
(c) The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
(d) The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the text explicitly states that IFPRI is a major research center of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).  While IFPRI collaborates with various international organizations, including those mentioned in options (a) and (c), its primary affiliation is with CGIAR. Option (d) is incorrect as the World Economic Forum focuses on global economic and geopolitical issues, not directly on food policy research.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the organizational structure and affiliations within the field of international agricultural research.  A strong understanding of the global food security landscape is crucial for UPSC aspirants, making this a relevant and challenging question.


**2.  A recent report highlighted a surge in food prices in 2021-22. Which factors contributed significantly to this surge, according to the provided information?**

(a)  Increased demand due to population growth and changing dietary patterns.
(b)  Supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war.
(c)  Speculative trading and market manipulation by large food corporations.
(d)  Adverse weather conditions leading to widespread crop failures across multiple regions.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because the text directly attributes the surge in food prices to "supply bottlenecks of COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine war".  While options (a), (c), and (d) are all potential factors influencing food prices in a broader context, the passage explicitly mentions the pandemic and the war as the primary drivers of the 2021-22 price increase.  This question tests the ability to identify specific causal factors from provided information, a skill essential for analyzing complex socio-economic issues.  Understanding the impact of geopolitical events on global food security is crucial for UPSC preparation.


**3. The UNHCR's "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" highlighted which of the following key findings?**

(a) A significant increase in forced displacement due to natural disasters.
(b) A decrease in the number of refugees hosted by low- and middle-income countries.
(c) A substantial rise in forced migration due to social and climate crises compared to 2021.
(d) A decrease in the number of stateless people compared to the previous year.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c). The provided text states that forced migration due to social and climate crises in 2022 was 21% higher than in 2021.  While other factors contribute to forced displacement (as implied by options (a) and (d)), the report specifically highlighted the 21% increase in migration due to social and climate factors. Option (b) is incorrect as the report actually states that 76% of the world's refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries.  This question assesses factual recall and the ability to extract specific data from a larger body of information – a common skill tested in UPSC exams.


**4.  The GANHRI's decision to defer the accreditation of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was primarily based on which of the following concerns?**

(a)  Lack of financial transparency and accountability in NHRC operations.
(b)  Insufficient representation of marginalized communities within the NHRC structure.
(c)  Allegations of human rights violations committed by NHRC officials.
(d)  Concerns regarding political interference in appointments and lack of cooperation with civil society.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that GANHRI deferred the NHRC's accreditation due to objections including "political interference in appointments, involving police in probes into human rights violations, poor cooperation with civil society."  While (b) is a valid concern addressed in previous GANHRI reviews, the immediate reason for the deferral is (d). Options (a) and (c) are not mentioned as direct reasons in the provided text. This question tests the ability to identify the primary cause-and-effect relationship from a complex situation, a skill essential for analyzing policy and governance issues.


**5. Which of the following bodies is responsible for reviewing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) in compliance with the Paris Principles?**

(a) The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).
(b) The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).
(c) The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI).
(d) The International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that GANHRI is responsible for reviewing and accrediting NHRIs in compliance with the Paris Principles.  While the UNHRC, OHCHR, and the International Coordinating Committee (GANHRI's predecessor) are involved in human rights issues, the specific responsibility for accreditation under the Paris Principles rests with GANHRI. This question tests direct factual recall of the organization's functions within the international human rights framework.


**6. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is a high-level advisory body to which UN entity?**

(a) The United Nations General Assembly.
(b) The United Nations Human Rights Council.
(c) The United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
(d) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that UNPFII is a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).  This question directly tests factual recall of the UNPFII's institutional position within the UN system.


**7.  The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs aligns with which of the following frameworks?**

(a) The World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).
(b) The Global Indicator Framework (GIF).
(c) The Human Development Index (HDI).
(d) The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI).

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the NIF aligns with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF).  The question tests the ability to understand the relationship between national and international frameworks for monitoring sustainable development.


**8. Which of the following parameters is NOT included in the Global Gender Gap Index?**

(a) Economic Participation and Opportunity.
(b) Educational Attainment.
(c)  Health and Survival.
(d)  Income Inequality within Households.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text lists Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment as the four parameters of the Global Gender Gap Index. Income inequality within households, while relevant to gender equality, is not explicitly listed as a parameter in the index. This tests the ability to identify what is explicitly stated versus what is implied.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.  Note that the questions are framed to avoid any direct mention of the source document.


**1.  A global partnership established in 1971, focused on research for a food-secure future, is the parent organization of a major research center established in 1975, headquartered in Washington, D.C., and working in over 60 countries, including India.  Which organization is the parent body?**

(a) The World Bank
(b) The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c) The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
(d) The International Monetary Fund (IMF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and its relationship with CGIAR.  The World Bank, FAO, and IMF are all significant international organizations, but they are not the parent organization of IFPRI. CGIAR, established in 1971, is explicitly identified as the parent organization of IFPRI in the provided text.  The description of IFPRI's work in food security and its global reach further solidifies the correct answer.  The other options are plausible distractors for someone with general knowledge of international organizations, but they lack the specific parent-subsidiary relationship described.


**2.  A report titled "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" highlighted a significant increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises in 2022, compared to the previous year.  This report was released by which organization?**

(a) The International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b) The World Health Organization (WHO)
(c) The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d) Amnesty International

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly refers to a specific report and its key finding, namely the increase in forced displacement due to social and climate crises.  While the IOM, WHO, and Amnesty International all work on related issues, only the UNHCR is explicitly linked to the report in the provided text.  The UNHCR's mandate focuses on protecting refugees and those forcibly displaced, making it the most logical organization to release such a report.  The other options are plausible distractors, but the specific report title and the focus on forced displacement strongly indicate the UNHCR as the correct answer.


**3.  In 2023, a US-led collaboration focused on diversifying and stabilizing global supply chains for critical minerals, including cobalt, nickel, and lithium, inducted a significant Asian nation as a new member. Which nation joined this partnership?**

(a) China
(b) Japan
(c) South Korea
(d) India

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question describes the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) and its focus on critical minerals. While China, Japan, and South Korea are all significant players in the global minerals market and are involved in various international collaborations, only India's induction into the MSP in 2023 is explicitly mentioned in the provided text. The description of the MSP's mandate, including its focus on global supply chain diversification and investment, further reinforces the connection to India's membership. Other options are potential distractors, representing countries with significant involvement in global mineral production and trade.


**4.  A multilateral development bank, established in 2016 and headquartered in Beijing, aims to finance infrastructure projects focusing on sustainable development in Asia and beyond.  This bank's largest shareholder holds a veto power.  What is the name of this bank?**

(a) The New Development Bank (NDB)
(b) The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
(c) The World Bank
(d) The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question describes the key characteristics of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).  While the NDB, ADB, and World Bank are all involved in development finance, only the AIIB matches all the criteria mentioned: establishment in 2016, headquarters in Beijing, focus on Asian infrastructure, and the presence of a veto power held by its largest shareholder (China).  The other options are plausible but fail to meet all the specific details provided in the question.  The emphasis on sustainable development and the geographical focus further pinpoint the AIIB as the correct answer.


**5.  A 2023 report, "Rethinking food crisis responses," highlighted the rise in food insecurity during 2020-2022 due to various factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war.  This report was published by which institution?**

(a) The World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
(c) The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question centers on a report focusing on food crises and their contributing factors. While the WFP, FAO, and UNDP all address food security issues, only the IFPRI is connected to the "Rethinking food crisis responses" report.  The report's focus on food insecurity, its mention of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war as contributing factors, and the timeframe (2020-2022) align perfectly with the information provided in the text about the IFPRI report. The other options, though relevant to food security, are not directly linked to the specific report described.


**6. An organization, headquartered in Geneva, reviews and accredits National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Paris Principles.  This organization recently deferred the accreditation of a prominent Asian nation's NHRC. What is the name of this organization?**

(a) The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
(b) Human Rights Watch
(c) The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d) Amnesty International


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question highlights the function of accrediting NHRIs based on the Paris Principles.  The OHCHR, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International are all involved in human rights advocacy and monitoring, but only GANHRI is explicitly identified as the organization responsible for reviewing and accrediting NHRIs based on the Paris Principles.  The mention of the deferred accreditation further strengthens the link to GANHRI.  The other options, while relevant to human rights, do not fulfill the specific role described in the question.


**7.  A high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), established in 2000, deals with indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, the environment, education, health, and human rights. What is the name of this body?**

(a) The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(b) The Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples
(c) The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(d) The UN Human Rights Council


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The question describes a UN body focused on indigenous issues and its advisory role to ECOSOC.  While the Special Rapporteur, Expert Mechanism, and Human Rights Council all address indigenous rights, only the UNPFII matches the description of a high-level advisory body to ECOSOC established in 2000 with a broad mandate encompassing economic, social, cultural, environmental, educational, health, and human rights aspects of indigenous issues. The other options, though relevant to indigenous rights, do not precisely fit the detailed description provided.


**8.  A recent report examined the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women worldwide across political, educational, economic, and physical integrity dimensions.  This index was released by which organization?**

(a) The World Bank
(b) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c) UN Women
(d) The World Economic Forum


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question describes an index focusing on gender inequality across multiple dimensions. While the World Bank, UN Women, and the World Economic Forum address gender issues, only the UNDP is explicitly linked to the Gender Social Norms Index in the provided text. The index's focus on systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by women, along with its four dimensions (political, educational, economic, and physical integrity), uniquely points to the UNDP as the releasing organization. The other options, though involved in gender equality work, do not match the specific index described.


**9. Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023, in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)?**

(a) The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(b) The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(c) The UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(d) The World Health Organization (WHO)


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The question asks about the release of a specific report concerning India's aging population.  While several organizations work on population issues, only the UNFPA is explicitly linked to the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with IIPS. The collaboration with IIPS and the specific report title strongly suggest the UNFPA as the correct answer. The other options, although involved in population studies, do not match the specific report and collaboration mentioned.


**10.  Which of the following Acts replaced the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(c) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015
(d) The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the legislation that superseded the Criminal Tribes Act, a piece of legislation that impacted marginalized communities. While the other options relate to the protection of vulnerable groups, only the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952 directly replaced the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871.  The question tests knowledge about the historical context and legal evolution concerning the treatment of marginalized communities in India.  The other options are distractors that deal with related but distinct legal frameworks.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  The questions are designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and careful analysis.


**1.  A global index assesses the systemic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women across four dimensions: Political, Educational, Economic, and Physical Integrity. Which index is being described?**

(a) Global Gender Gap Index
(b) Gender Social Norms Index
(c) UHC Service Coverage Index
(d) Women’s Empowerment Index


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question describes the Gender Social Norms Index, which specifically focuses on understanding the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by women and girls globally across political, educational, economic, and physical integrity dimensions.  The Global Gender Gap Index, while related, uses different parameters (Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; Political Empowerment). The UHC Service Coverage Index tracks health service access, and the Women’s Empowerment Index focuses solely on women's power and freedoms.  Therefore, only the Gender Social Norms Index precisely matches the description provided.  Understanding the nuances between these indices is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of gender equality metrics. The different approaches employed by each index highlight the complexity of measuring gender inequality, requiring a multifaceted approach to address the diverse challenges faced by women and girls worldwide.


**2. The World Economic Forum annually releases an index that assesses gender equality across four key areas: Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment. What is the name of this index?**

(a) Gender Social Norms Index
(b) Global Gender Parity Index
(c) Global Gender Gap Index
(d) Women’s Empowerment Index

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description perfectly aligns with the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), published annually by the World Economic Forum.  This index is widely recognized and used to track progress toward gender equality across various dimensions. The other options, while related to gender issues, focus on different aspects. The Gender Social Norms Index looks at the social norms that perpetuate gender inequality, while the Global Gender Parity Index and the Women's Empowerment Index have different scopes and methodologies.  The GGGI's comprehensive approach, covering economic, educational, health, and political aspects, makes it the most accurate answer.  Knowledge of this index is vital for understanding global trends in gender equality and the efforts made to bridge gender gaps.


**3.  An initiative launched in 2017 aims to reduce stunting in high-malnutrition districts by improving Anganwadi services. What is the name of this initiative?**

(a) Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(b) Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(c) National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan)
(d) Saksham Anganwadis

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Nutrition Mission, also known as POSHAN Abhiyan, launched in 2017, specifically targets the reduction of stunting in high-malnutrition districts through improvements in Anganwadi services. While other initiatives like Intensified Mission Indradhanush (focused on immunizations) and Ayushman Bharat Yojana (focused on health insurance) contribute to overall child health,  POSHAN Abhiyan directly addresses malnutrition and leverages the Anganwadi system to achieve its goals. Saksham Anganwadis is a program to strengthen Anganwadis, but the core focus of reducing stunting is the POSHAN Abhiyan's primary objective.  Understanding the specific mandates of different government programs is crucial for effective policy analysis and program evaluation. The strategic integration of nutrition interventions with existing infrastructure, like Anganwadis, highlights the importance of holistic approaches to public health.


**4. Which organization jointly released the 2023 Global Monitoring report on Tracking Universal Health Coverage, highlighting accessibility, affordability, and quality as key dimensions?**

(a) UNFPA and IIPS
(b) WHO and World Bank
(c) UNICEF and World Health Organization
(d) UNDESA and the World Food Programme


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank are the organizations that jointly released the 2023 Global Monitoring Report on Tracking Universal Health Coverage (UHC). This report is a significant contribution to the global understanding of UHC progress and challenges.  The other options represent different organizations with different mandates. UNFPA and IIPS focus on population issues, UNICEF on children's welfare, and UNDESA and the World Food Programme on broader development goals. The WHO and World Bank's collaborative effort underscores the importance of international cooperation in addressing global health challenges.   The report's focus on accessibility, affordability, and quality reflects the multifaceted nature of UHC and the need for comprehensive strategies to ensure health equity.


**5. Which organization is responsible for reviewing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) in compliance with the Paris Principles?**

(a) UNPFII
(b) UNCRC
(c) GANHRI
(d) UNHCR

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is the organization responsible for reviewing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) according to the Paris Principles.  These principles establish standards for NHRIs worldwide. The other organizations have different focuses: UNPFII deals with indigenous issues, UNCRC with children's rights, and UNHCR with refugees.  GANHRI's role in promoting and strengthening human rights institutions is crucial for upholding human rights globally. The Paris Principles provide a benchmark for the independence, authority, and effectiveness of NHRIs, ensuring their ability to protect human rights within their respective countries.  The accreditation process conducted by GANHRI adds a layer of accountability and promotes best practices in human rights protection.


**6. A report titled "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022" was released by which organization?**

(a)  UNDESA
(b)  UNFPA
(c)  UNHCR
(d)  GANHRI

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) released the report titled "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022." This report provides crucial data and analysis on global forced displacement, including refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. The other options are organizations that address various social and development issues, but their focus isn't primarily on forced displacement.  The UNHCR's mandate specifically includes protecting refugees and assisting them in finding durable solutions.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. While WHO deals with health, WFP with food security, and IFPRI with food policy research, their mandates do not directly align with the specific focus on the "triple burden" of WASH threats to children as described in the question.


**6. The National Nutrition Mission (NNM), also known as POSHAN Abhiyan, launched in 2017, aims to reduce stunting in high-malnutrition districts and ensure holistic development and nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children.  Which ministry oversees this mission?**

(a) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(d) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The question directly references the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan) and its goals concerning nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children. The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) is the ministry responsible for this mission.  The MoWCD's mandate encompasses the welfare of women and children, making it the logical ministry to oversee a program focused on nutrition within this demographic.  The other options are incorrect as their primary responsibilities do not directly align with the mission's objectives.


**7.  The  "Global Gender Gap Index," released annually by the World Economic Forum, assesses gender equality across four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.  In 2023, India's ranking in this index was:**

(a) Above 100
(b) Below 100
(c)  127 out of 146 countries
(d)  Within the top 25 countries

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question asks about India's specific ranking in the Global Gender Gap Index in 2023.  The text explicitly states that India was ranked 127th out of 146 countries in 2023.  The other options are incorrect because they do not reflect the accurate ranking provided in the source material.


**8.  The  "Gender Social Norms Index," released by the United Nations Development Programme, seeks to understand systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women worldwide.  Which of the following is NOT a dimension of this index?**

(a) Political
(b)  Educational
(c)  Economic
(d)  Environmental

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question asks about the dimensions of the Gender Social Norms Index. The text clearly lists the dimensions as Political, Educational, Economic, and Physical integrity.  Environmental is not included.  Therefore, (d) is the correct answer.


**9. The recently enacted Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, aims to provide strategic direction for research, innovation, and entrepreneurship in various fields. Which ministry serves as the administrative department for the NRF?**

(a) Ministry of Education
(b) Ministry of Science and Technology
(c) Department of Science and Technology
(d) Department of Higher Education

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question specifically asks about the administrative department responsible for the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF). The text explicitly states that the Department of Science and Technology (DST) will serve as the administrative department for the NRF.  While the Ministry of Science and Technology oversees the DST, the question asks for the specific *department*, making (c) the correct answer.


**10. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), released by the Ministry of Education, proposes a new curricular and pedagogical structure. This new structure is based on which age grouping?**

(a) 4+4+4+4
(b) 5+3+3+4
(c) 6+3+3+4
(d) 5+4+3+4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the age-based structure of the proposed curriculum framework.  The text explicitly states that the NCF-SE is designed with a 5+3+3+4 structure in terms of age groups.  The other options are incorrect as they do not represent the age-grouping mentioned in the source text.



Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1.  Which entity is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 in India?**

(a) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(b) National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board
(c) Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India
(d) Supreme Court of India

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, establishes the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) as the primary body responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act.  This includes reviewing and monitoring its implementation, supervising the functioning of State ART Supervisory Boards (SARTSBs), and ensuring adherence to the regulations.  While the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare plays a role in policy formulation and the Supreme Court interprets the law, the NARTSB holds the primary executive responsibility. The IRDAI is involved in regulating insurance aspects related to surrogacy but not directly involved in the overall implementation of the Act.


**2.  According to the provided text, which state in India houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Andhra Pradesh

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that Odisha has the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, the question specifically asks about PVTGs, a distinct category within Scheduled Tribes. Chhattisgarh is also mentioned as having some PVTGs, but the text clearly indicates Odisha holds the highest number.  Andhra Pradesh is not highlighted as having a particularly large number of PVTGs in this context.


**3. Which of the following Acts aims to regulate and supervise Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) clinics and banks in India?**

(a) Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
(b) Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c) Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021
(d) Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, is specifically designed to regulate and supervise ART clinics and banks, aiming to prevent misuse and ensure ethical practices in ART services. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, while related, focuses specifically on surrogacy. The Juvenile Justice Act deals with children's rights and protection, while the Act on manual scavengers addresses a different social issue entirely.


**4. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) recently issued guidelines for which specific aspect of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015?**

(a) Child adoption procedures
(b) Assessment of child suspects in heinous offenses
(c) Rehabilitation of child laborers
(d) Prevention of child trafficking

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The text explicitly mentions that the NCPCR issued guidelines for the assessment of child suspects in heinous offenses under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015. While the Act addresses adoption, child labor, and trafficking, the NCPCR's recent guidelines focus specifically on the assessment process for children involved in serious crimes.


**5. Which international organization released the report titled ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022’?**

(a) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(b) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)

The other organizations mentioned in the text focus on different areas, such as food policy, population trends, and human rights, respectively.


**6.  The "SEED" scheme, aimed at the economic empowerment of a specific vulnerable group, falls under the purview of which Indian ministry?**

(a) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(b) Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Rural Development
(d) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is launched by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The other ministries focus on different areas of social welfare, but the SEED scheme's specific target group and purpose place it firmly under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.


**7.  Which organization is responsible for developing and circulating guidelines to Indian states and union territories for the development of State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs) for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?**

(a)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(b)  National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog)
(c)  Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)
(d)  The Planning Commission of India

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) developed and circulated guidelines to the States/UTs for the development of State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs) for SDGs.  The other organizations are not mentioned in this context as being directly responsible for this task.


**8.  The  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) was last revised in which year before the recent release?**

(a) 2010
(b) 2015
(c) 2005

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c) Availability
(d) Quality

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions accessibility, affordability, and quality as key dimensions of UHC.  While availability of services is crucial for UHC, it is not explicitly listed as a separate dimension in the provided text.  The phrasing of the question requires selecting the option that is *not* explicitly mentioned as a key dimension.



**10.  The  "Annapurti" initiative, focused on transforming the Public Distribution System (PDS), is associated with which organization?**

(a)  Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution
(b)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(c)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text specifically mentions that the World Food Programme (WFP) is piloting innovative solutions such as 'Annapurti', automatic grain dispensers, for the PDS in India.  While the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution is involved in the PDS, the 'Annapurti' initiative is explicitly linked to the WFP's work in India.  IFPRI and FAO are international organizations that work on food-related issues, but they are not directly associated with the Annapurti initiative.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the subject matter.  The difficulty level is assessed as "difficult" for each question due to the nuanced nature of the concepts and the need for precise factual recall.


**1.  Which organization released a report highlighting the rise in food insecurity between 2020 and 2022, attributing it to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, and projecting a further increase in undernourished individuals by 2050?**

(a)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(b)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(c)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is explicitly mentioned in the text as the source of a report detailing the rise in food insecurity due to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, and projecting a substantial increase in undernourished individuals by 2050.  The other organizations, while involved in related work, are not specifically linked to this particular report in the provided text.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify the correct source of information from a list of plausible alternatives.  Understanding the roles of different international organizations in addressing global food security is crucial for UPSC preparation.


**2. Which of the following accurately describes the key features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF) in India?**

(a) It focuses solely on higher education, streamlining credit transfer within universities.
(b) It is a framework exclusively for vocational training, aiming to improve skill development.
(c) It integrates credits from school, higher education, and vocational/skill education, promoting flexibility and mobility.
(d) It is a rigid system that does not allow for credit transfer between different educational streams.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF is explicitly described as an "inclusive single Meta Framework" designed to seamlessly integrate credits earned through various educational pathways – school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education. This integration aims to enhance flexibility and mobility for learners. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they limit the scope of NCrF, while option (d) contradicts its core purpose of facilitating credit transfer.  The question tests conceptual understanding of NCrF and its objectives within the broader context of education reforms in India. The ability to synthesize information and identify the core function of a policy is critical for UPSC success.


**3. Which government agency is responsible for overseeing and supervising the accreditation system for Higher Educational Institutions in India, as envisioned by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020?**

(a) University Grants Commission (UGC)
(b) National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC)
(c) National Accreditation Council (NAC)
(d) National Medical Commission (NMC)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text specifically mentions the National Accreditation Council (NAC) as the envisioned "meta-accrediting body" responsible for overseeing and supervising the accreditation ecosystem for Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) as per NEP 2020. While the UGC and NAAC play roles in higher education, they are not the designated meta-accrediting body. The NMC is focused on medical education. This question tests factual knowledge of the organizational structure related to HEI accreditation and the implementation of NEP 2020.  Understanding the roles and responsibilities of different regulatory bodies is essential for UPSC preparation.


**4.  The Global Gender Gap Index, released annually, assesses gender equality across which four parameters?**

(a) Economic Participation, Social Mobility, Health Outcomes, and Political Representation
(b) Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment
(c)  Economic Growth, Social Justice, Healthcare Access, and Political Stability
(d)  Income Equality, Education Levels, Life Expectancy, and Voter Turnout


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Global Gender Gap Index uses four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.  Options (a), (c), and (d) present plausible but ultimately incorrect combinations of factors. The question tests factual recall of specific index components and understanding of gender equality metrics.  The ability to recall and analyze the components of a global index is a valuable skill for UPSC aspirants.

(d) Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Ministry of Urban Development


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly states that NAMASTE is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  The other options present incorrect pairings of ministries. The question tests factual recall of specific government schemes and their associated ministries.  Knowledge of government schemes and their implementing ministries is frequently tested in the UPSC exam.


**6. Which of the following accurately reflects the mandate of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)?**

(a) To provide financial aid to children in need globally.
(b) To monitor the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by its state parties.
(c) To exclusively focus on children's education and healthcare.
(d) To mediate international disputes related to child welfare.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the UNCRC monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by its state parties. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect representations of the UNCRC's mandate. This question assesses the understanding of the role and responsibilities of a specific UN body related to children's rights.  Knowledge of international organizations and their functions is a key component of UPSC preparation.


**7.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education systems in India classifies States/UTs and districts into how many grades?**

(a) Five
(b) Seven
(c) Nine
(d) Ten


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the PGI classifies States/UTs and districts into ten grades, ranging from "Daksh" (highest) to "Akanshi-3" (lowest).  The other options provide incorrect numbers of grades. This question tests the precise recall of numerical data related to a specific educational assessment framework.  Attention to detail and the ability to remember specific numerical data are important for UPSC success.


**8. Which of the following was the highest grade attained by any State/UT in the PGI 2.0 for the year 2021-22?**

(a) Daksh
(b) Utkarsh
(c) Atti-Uttam
(d) Prachesta-2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The passage clearly states that in the PGI 2.0 for 2021-22, the highest grade achieved was Prachesta-2, by two states/UTs.  This question assesses the ability to extract specific information from a descriptive passage, testing factual recall and understanding of the grading system.


**9. The  "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" was released by which organization?**

(a) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(b) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the UNHCR released the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report."  The other organizations are involved in different areas of social development and humanitarian work, but not this specific report. This question tests factual recall and the ability to link reports to their respective releasing organizations.


**10.  The  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry alongside which other key aspect of science education?**

(a)  Memorization of scientific facts and formulas.
(b)  Acquiring knowledge of fundamental theories and laws.
(c)  Conducting complex laboratory experiments independently.
(d)  Developing advanced research skills.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that NCF-SE emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry *along with* acquiring knowledge of fundamental theories and laws.  The other options are not the direct focus mentioned in the passage.  This question tests the ability to understand the specific balance emphasized in the NCF-SE framework.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India's education and healthcare systems.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth understanding.


**1.  A new framework aims to seamlessly integrate credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, ensuring flexibility and mobility.  Which of the following is the name of this framework?**

(a) National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(b) National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(c) National Credit Framework (NCRF)
(d) National Curriculum Framework (NCF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Credit Framework (NCRF) is explicitly designed to integrate credits across different educational pathways, facilitating smoother transitions between school, higher education, and vocational training.  The NSQF focuses specifically on skills qualifications, while the NHEQF pertains only to higher education. The NCF is a broader curriculum framework, not directly focused on credit transfer. The NCRF acts as a meta-framework, encompassing NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF for comprehensive credit integration.  This holistic approach addresses a major gap in India's education system, allowing for greater flexibility and personalized learning journeys.  Students can accumulate credits from diverse learning experiences, making education more accessible and adaptable to individual circumstances.  This aligns with the goals of lifelong learning and improved educational mobility promoted by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.


**2.  A committee's recommendations aim to reform the accreditation system for Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in India, transitioning to a binary system. What is the name of this committee, and what key recommendation did it suggest regarding the transition timeline?**

(a)  The Yash Pal Committee; Transition to be completed by 2025.
(b) The Kothari Commission;  A phased transition over five years.
(c) The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee;  Transition by December 2023.
(d) The National Education Policy Committee; Immediate transition.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee was tasked with reforming the HEI accreditation system.  A key recommendation was that the transition to the proposed binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited) should be completed by December 2023, even if the National Accreditation Council (NAC) is established later. The other options are incorrect. The Yash Pal Committee and Kothari Commission focused on other aspects of education reform.  The NEP 2020 envisioned the NAC, but the Radhakrishnan Committee provided the specific timeline for the transition. This demonstrates a proactive approach to improving HEI quality assurance, irrespective of the full establishment of the NAC.  The ambitious timeline highlights the urgency for improvements in the Indian higher education sector.


**3.  A recent report highlights the need to improve access to quality health services without financial hardship. Which of the following correctly identifies the concept being described and a key dimension of its implementation?**

(a)  National Health Policy 2017;  Focus on primary healthcare.
(b)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana;  Emphasis on affordability.
(c)  Universal Health Coverage (UHC);  Accessibility, affordability, and quality as key dimensions.
(d)  Intensified Mission Indradhanush;  Improved vaccination rates.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description refers to Universal Health Coverage (UHC), which aims to ensure all individuals have access to quality health services without facing financial hardship.  Accessibility, affordability, and quality are explicitly mentioned as its key dimensions. While Ayushman Bharat Yojana and National Health Policy 2017 contribute to UHC, they are not the core definition. Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on vaccination, a component of health services, not the overall concept of UHC.  Achieving UHC requires a multifaceted approach that addresses all three dimensions—accessibility (geographic and financial), affordability (cost of services), and quality (effectiveness and safety of care).  This is a significant global health goal, and India's progress toward UHC is a key indicator of its development and social progress.


**4.  Several acts aim to improve the quality of education and healthcare in specific sectors. Which of the following correctly pairs an act with its intended sector of improvement?**

(a)  National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023;  Dental education.
(b)  National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023;  Nursing education.
(c)  National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019;  Higher education.
(d)  National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023; Nursing and midwifery education.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NNMC Act, 2023, specifically targets improvements in nursing and midwifery education and regulation in India. The NDC Act, 2023, focuses on the dental sector. The NMC Act, 2019, regulates medical education.  The NNMC Act aims to address critical shortages of nurses and midwives in India, particularly in underserved areas.  The act seeks to standardize education, improve training, and streamline the regulatory framework.  This reflects a growing recognition of the crucial role of nurses and midwives in providing quality healthcare, especially in primary healthcare settings.  The creation of a dedicated commission highlights the government's commitment to strengthening this vital sector.


**5.  An index tracks progress towards a specific sustainable development goal (SDG) by assessing indicators related to health services. Which index is this, and what are some of the categories of indicators it includes?**

(a)  Global Hunger Index (GHI);  Undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting.
(b)  UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI);  Reproductive, maternal, newborn, child health; infectious diseases; non-communicable diseases; service capacity and access.
(c)  Gender Social Norms Index;  Political, educational, economic, and physical integrity.
(d)  Global Gender Gap Index;  Economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, political empowerment.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) tracks progress towards SDG 3.8.1 (Universal Health Coverage).  The SCI uses indicator categories encompassing reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health; infectious diseases; non-communicable diseases; and service capacity and access.  The other indices measure different aspects of development: GHI focuses on hunger and malnutrition; the Gender Social Norms Index assesses gender inequality; and the Global Gender Gap Index evaluates gender disparities across various dimensions.  The SCI provides a valuable metric for assessing the extent to which countries are achieving UHC, highlighting areas needing improvement.  The inclusion of diverse health indicators allows for a comprehensive assessment of health service delivery and population health outcomes.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring a deep understanding of the material and careful consideration of the options.

**1.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently highlighted the need for implementing a specific commission's report. This report recommended the establishment of a permanent body to address the concerns of a particular group in India.  Which group is this?**

(a) Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b) Scheduled Tribes (STs)
(c) De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)
(d) Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the NHRC's emphasis on implementing the Idate Commission report. This report specifically focuses on establishing a permanent commission for De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs) in India, acknowledging their unique vulnerabilities and need for dedicated support.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent other vulnerable groups in India, but the NHRC's focus in the news item explicitly points to DNTs.  The question tests factual recall regarding recent news items and the specific focus of the Idate Commission.


**2.  A particular group of tribal communities in India is centrally recognized and categorized based on specific criteria.  These criteria include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  What is the official designation of this group?**

(a) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(b) Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs)
(c) Adivasi Communities
(d) Indigenous Populations

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The description clearly outlines the criteria used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). While the term "Primitive Tribal Groups" (PTGs) was previously used, it was officially changed to PVTGs in 2006.  The question tests conceptual understanding of the categorization of tribal groups in India and the specific criteria that define PVTGs.  Options (c) and (d) are broader terms encompassing various tribal communities but do not specifically address the criteria mentioned.

(a) Gond and Oraon
(b) Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga
(c) Santhal and Munda
(d) Bhil and Mina

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question directly tests factual recall regarding recent developments related to the Forest Rights Act. The news specifically mentions the granting of habitat rights to the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  The other options list other tribal groups present in India, but they were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as recipients of these rights under the Forest Rights Act.



**4.  A specific government scheme aims to improve the educational empowerment of De-Notified Tribes (DNTs) who are not covered under existing schemes for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), or Other Backward Castes (OBCs). What is the name of this scheme?**

(a) Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme
(b) Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(c) Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship
(d) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The question focuses on a specific government initiative targeting DNTs' educational needs. The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship scheme specifically addresses this need, providing financial assistance to DNT students who are not covered under other existing reservation policies.  The other options mention other government schemes, but they don't specifically target the educational empowerment of DNTs who are not included under SC/ST/OBC categories.


**5.  Which of the following Acts was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, leading to the removal of a specific label from certain tribal communities?**

(a) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(b) The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
(c) The Forest Rights Act, 2006
(d) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** This question tests knowledge of historical legislation and its impact on marginalized communities. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, labelled certain communities as "born criminals."  The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, repealed this discriminatory legislation.  The other options represent different Acts focusing on different social issues, not directly related to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act and the subsequent removal of the "criminal" label.


**6.  A landmark judgment by the Office of Chief Commissioners of Persons with Disabilities mandates that government offices operating in inaccessible buildings must relocate their services. To which specific location must these services be moved?**

(a) To a newly constructed accessible building.
(b) To a different government building with better accessibility.
(c) To the ground floor or an accessible location within the same facility.
(d) To a temporary location until accessibility improvements are made.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question tests the understanding of a specific court ruling related to accessibility for Persons with Disabilities. The judgment mandates that government services be relocated to the ground floor or an accessible location within the same building, prioritizing immediate accessibility improvements.  Other options present alternative solutions, but the court ruling explicitly focuses on relocation within the existing facility.


**7. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation percentage for PwDs in government jobs. What is this percentage?**

(a) 2%
(b) 3%
(c) 4%
(d) 5%

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question tests factual recall about specific provisions within the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.  The other options provide alternative percentages, but only 4% is the correct figure as stated in the act.


**8.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, outlines penalties for violating its provisions. What is the maximum punishment prescribed under this Act?**

(a) A fine of Rs. 50,000
(b) Imprisonment for up to one year
(c) Imprisonment for up to two years or a fine of up to Rs. One Lakh, or both.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question tests knowledge of the legal framework related to manual scavenging. The act specifies that violating its provisions can result in imprisonment of up to two years, a fine of up to Rs. One Lakh, or both.  The other options present alternative penalties but do not accurately reflect the maximum punishment as defined in the act.


**9.  The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices and prevent deaths of sewer and septic tank workers. Which ministry is primarily involved in this initiative?**

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assess different cognitive skills, with a detailed explanation provided for each correct answer.

**1.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs plays a central role in addressing the needs of India's tribal populations.  Considering the significant disparities among tribal groups, which of the following statements accurately reflects the current situation regarding the distribution of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India?**

(a)  Odisha has the largest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).
(b)  Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of STs.
(c)  Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh share an identical list of PVTGs.
(d)  Andaman and Nicobar Islands have the lowest number of PVTGs.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement (b) is correct. While Odisha holds the highest number of PVTGs, Madhya Pradesh boasts the largest absolute population of STs overall.  This highlights the complexity of addressing tribal welfare, requiring nuanced policies that account for both numerical dominance and the specific vulnerabilities of particular groups. Option (a) is incorrect because Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs, not the highest number of STs in total. Option (c) is incorrect because while some PVTGs are found in both states, the lists are not identical. Option (d) is not directly comparable; the statement refers to the number of PVTGs, not the total ST population.  The sheer numerical size of the ST population in Madhya Pradesh necessitates a distinct focus on resource allocation and policy implementation. This underscores the need for comprehensive data-driven strategies in tribal welfare.


**2. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, aims to secure the rights of forest-dwelling communities.  Considering the recent applications of this act, which of the following tribal groups has been granted habitat rights under this legislation?**

(a)  Chenchus
(b)  Konda Reddis
(c)  Bharia
(d)  Kurabas


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharia tribe, categorized as a PVTG, has recently been granted habitat rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. This demonstrates the ongoing efforts to secure land and forest rights for particularly vulnerable tribal groups.  The Chenchus and Konda Reddis, while also tribal groups, were not specifically mentioned in the provided context regarding recent applications of the Forest Rights Act.  The Kurabas are another tribal group but not mentioned in the context of recent habitat rights grants. The successful application of the Forest Rights Act to the Bharia tribe highlights the importance of targeted legal interventions to protect the rights and livelihoods of vulnerable communities. This also underscores the complex interplay between legal frameworks and the practical implementation of such laws.


**3.  The concept of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) reflects a specific approach to addressing the needs of certain tribal communities within India. Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify PVTGs?**

(a)  Pre-agricultural level of technology.
(b)  High levels of literacy.
(c)  Economic backwardness.
(d)  Declining or stagnant population.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

High levels of literacy are NOT a criterion for identifying PVTGs. In fact, low levels of literacy are a key characteristic of PVTGs, indicating their socio-economic vulnerability.  The other options—pre-agricultural technology, economic backwardness, and declining/stagnant population—are all recognized indicators of the vulnerability that defines PVTGs. This question highlights the importance of understanding the specific criteria used to categorize vulnerable populations and the implications of these categorizations for policy design.  The contrast between high literacy and the reality of PVTG characteristics emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to address the unique challenges faced by these groups.


**4. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 had a profound and negative impact on certain communities in India.  Which of the following groups were designated as “criminal tribes” under this Act, later to be referred to as Denotified Tribes (DNTs)?**

(a)  Hakki Pikki
(b)  Gujjars
(c)  Both (a) and (b)
(d)  Neither (a) nor (b)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both the Hakki Pikki and Gujjars were among the groups classified as “criminal tribes” under the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871.  This act had a devastating impact on these communities, leading to social stigma and marginalization.  While the act has been repealed, the legacy of this discriminatory legislation continues to affect DNTs. This question tests the understanding of historical injustices and their ongoing consequences, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the historical context of social inequalities. The inclusion of both groups as correct answers highlights the broad sweep of the Criminal Tribes Act and the diverse communities impacted by its discriminatory provisions.


**5.  Several government initiatives aim to improve the lives of people with disabilities (PwDs). Which of the following is NOT a key provision or feature of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016?**

(a)  Reservation for PwDs in government jobs.
(b)  Recognition of 21 types of disabilities.
(c)  Mandatory reservation for PwDs in police forces.
(d)  Free education for children with benchmark disabilities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, does NOT mandate reservation for PwDs in police forces.  While the act provides for reservation in government jobs and educational institutions, it makes an exception for police forces.  The other options—reservation in government jobs, recognition of 21 types of disabilities, and free education for children with benchmark disabilities—are all key provisions of the Act. This question tests the understanding of specific legal provisions and their limitations, highlighting the importance of detailed knowledge of relevant legislation. The exclusion of police forces from the reservation policy underscores the need for ongoing advocacy and policy refinement to ensure inclusive practices across all sectors.


**6.  The issue of manual scavenging persists in India despite legal prohibitions.  Which of the following acts specifically addresses the prohibition of employment as manual scavengers and their rehabilitation?**

(a)  The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem.
(b)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013.
(c)  The Swachh Bharat Mission.
(d)  The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS).


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, directly addresses the prohibition of manual scavenging and the rehabilitation of those involved in this practice. While other initiatives like the National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem, Swachh Bharat Mission, and SRMS contribute to reducing manual scavenging, this act is the primary legislation focused on its prohibition and the rehabilitation of those affected. This question tests knowledge of specific legislation and its role in addressing social issues. The focus on the 2013 act highlights the importance of legal frameworks in combating harmful practices and ensuring the rehabilitation of affected individuals.  It emphasizes the need for both policy and practical measures to address the complex issue of manual scavenging.


**7.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) plays a vital role in upholding human rights in India. In the context of De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), what specific commission's report did the NHRC recently emphasize the need to implement?**

(a)  The Renke Commission report
(b)  The Idate Commission report
(c)  The Dhebar Commission report
(d)  The Mandal Commission report

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NHRC recently stressed the need to implement the recommendations of the Idate Commission report concerning DNTs.  This report likely addressed the specific needs and challenges faced by these communities.  The other commissions, while relevant to broader social issues, were not specifically mentioned in the context of the NHRC's recent statement regarding DNTs. This question assesses the knowledge of specific commissions and their relevance to particular social groups. The emphasis on the Idate Commission report underscores the importance of targeted policy recommendations for marginalized communities and the role of human rights institutions in advocating for their implementation.


**8.  The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 introduced significant changes to India's education system. What is the proposed curricular and pedagogical structure for schooling in terms of age groups, as recommended by NEP 2020?**

(a) 4+3+3+4
(b) 5+3+3+4
(c) 6+3+3+4
(d) 5+4+3+4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 recommends a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling based on age groups.  This structure represents a significant departure from the earlier system and aims to create a more holistic and flexible education framework. The other options do not reflect the NEP 2020's proposed structure. This question assesses the understanding of key policy reforms and their implications for the education system. The adoption of a new curricular and pedagogical structure reflects the government's commitment to improving the quality and accessibility of education in India.  The specific structure proposed highlights the importance of early childhood care and development and the need for a more integrated approach to education.


**9.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) provides an assessment of hunger levels in different countries. According to the GHI 2023, which of the following is the correct categorization of India's hunger level?**

(a)  Low
(b)  Moderate
(c)  Serious
(d)  Alarming

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2023 categorizes India's hunger level as "Serious."  This indicates a significant challenge in addressing hunger and malnutrition within the country.  While India's score might show some improvement compared to earlier years, it still reflects a concerning level of hunger that requires sustained and comprehensive interventions.  The other options do not accurately reflect India's GHI categorization. This question assesses the ability to interpret international indices and their implications for national policies. The "Serious" categorization highlights the need for focused efforts to improve food security and nutritional outcomes in India.  It calls for a comprehensive analysis of the underlying causes of hunger and the implementation of targeted programs to address this critical issue.


**10.  The concept of "ODF Plus" status reflects a higher standard of sanitation than simply "Open Defecation Free" (ODF).  Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of an ODF Plus Model village?**

(a)  Sustained ODF status.
(b)  Arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management.
(c)  Absence of any visible litter.
(d)  Presence of only rudimentary solid waste management systems.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

An ODF Plus Model village requires arrangements for BOTH solid and liquid waste management, going beyond a rudimentary system. The other options—sustained ODF status, absence of visible litter, and observing visual cleanliness—are all characteristics of an ODF Plus Model village. This question assesses the understanding of nuances in sanitation standards and the implications for achieving higher levels of environmental cleanliness. The requirement of comprehensive waste management systems in ODF Plus Model villages highlights the importance of holistic approaches to sanitation.  It emphasizes the need to move beyond basic ODF status and strive for a higher level of environmental hygiene and community well-being.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues and adhering to the specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and tests various cognitive skills.


**1.  A significant policy initiative aims to integrate credits earned through diverse educational pathways, fostering flexibility and mobility within the education system.  Which framework facilitates this integration?**

(a) National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(b) National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(c) National Credit Framework (NCrF)
(d) National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is explicitly designed to integrate credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education.  This creates a unified system, allowing for seamless transfer of credits between different educational programs and institutions.  Options (a) and (b) focus on specific sectors (skills and higher education respectively), while (d) focuses on the curriculum framework, not credit transfer.  The NCrF acts as a meta-framework encompassing these other frameworks, making it the most suitable answer.  This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of educational policy in India.  The difficulty is moderate due to the need to differentiate between closely related concepts within the Indian education system.


**2.  The concept of "Person with benchmark disability" under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, is defined by a specific percentage of disability. What is this percentage?**

(a) 30%
(b) 50%
(c) 40%
(d) 60%


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, defines a "Person with benchmark disability" as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability. This threshold is crucial for accessing various rights and benefits outlined in the Act.  The other options are incorrect and represent plausible distractors for someone with partial knowledge of the Act.  This tests factual recall and understanding of the legal definition of disability in India. The difficulty level is easy as the answer is directly stated in the provided text.


**3.  A specific category of Scheduled Tribes, recognized for their particularly vulnerable circumstances, were initially designated as Primitive Tribal Groups. What is the current official designation for this group?**

(a)  Vulnerable Tribal Groups (VTGs)
(b)  Especially Vulnerable Tribal Groups (EVTGs)
(c)  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(d)  Marginalized Tribal Groups (MTGs)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The text clearly states that the groups initially known as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) were renamed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in 2006. This renaming reflects a shift in terminology and a focus on the specific vulnerabilities faced by these communities. The other options are fabricated and serve as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the terminology used in Indian tribal welfare policy. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the evolution of terminology in Indian tribal welfare policies. The difficulty is moderate, requiring precise knowledge of the terminology used.


**4.  A 2008 commission identified a significant number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes in India. Which commission was this?**

(a)  The Sarkaria Commission
(b)  The Dhebar Commission
(c)  The Renke Commission
(d)  The Mandal Commission


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Renke Commission (2008) is explicitly mentioned as the source for the estimate of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes in India.  The other commissions focused on different aspects of Indian governance and social structure, making them incorrect choices.  The question tests factual recall and knowledge of Indian social science commissions.  The difficulty is moderate because the Renke Commission is less widely known compared to the other options.


**5.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, sets a maximum penalty for employing individuals in manual scavenging without proper safety equipment. Which of the following penalties is CORRECT?**

This highlights the seriousness of the offense. The other options are incorrect and designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the legal penalties. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of Indian labor laws. The difficulty is moderate, requiring precise recall of the legal penalties.


**6.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has advocated for the implementation of a specific report to address the needs of a marginalized group.  Which report is this?**

(a) The Sachar Committee Report
(b) The Idate Commission Report
(c) The Mandal Commission Report
(d) The Ranganath Mishra Report


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The text explicitly mentions the NHRC's call for the implementation of the Idate Commission report concerning De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs).  The other reports dealt with different issues, making them unsuitable answers. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the role of the NHRC in addressing social issues. The difficulty is moderate as it requires specific knowledge of the relevant commission and its report.


**7.  A specific community, historically designated as "born criminals" under British rule, is now the focus of welfare initiatives. What is the current name for this group?**

(a)  Nomadic Tribes (NTs)
(b)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(c)  De-notified Tribes (DNTs)
(d)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly discusses De-notified Tribes (DNTs) and their historical categorization as "born criminals" during British rule.  While some DNTs may be included in SCs, OBCs, or NTs, the question focuses on their specific designation and the historical context. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the historical context of social categorization in India. The difficulty is moderate because it requires knowledge of the specific historical context of the DNTs.


**8.  The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India is found in which state?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Jharkhand
(d) Odisha


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage directly states that Odisha has the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh also have PVTGs, Odisha holds the highest count. This question tests factual recall of geographical distribution of PVTGs.  The difficulty is easy because the answer is explicitly stated.


**9.  Which ministry is the nodal agency for the welfare of tribal communities in India?**

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Home Affairs


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly names the Ministry of Tribal Affairs as the nodal ministry for tribal welfare.  The other ministries have related responsibilities, but the primary responsibility for tribal welfare rests with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. This question tests factual recall of governmental responsibilities. The difficulty is easy because the answer is directly stated.


**10.  The  Global Gender Gap Index, released annually, uses several parameters to assess gender equality. Which of the following is NOT a parameter used in this Index?**

(a) Economic Participation and Opportunity
(b) Educational Attainment
(c)  Political Empowerment
(d)  Environmental Sustainability


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage lists Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment as the parameters used in the Global Gender Gap Index. Environmental Sustainability is not mentioned. This question tests factual recall and understanding of global indices related to gender equality. The difficulty is easy because the answer is directly implied by the omission of environmental sustainability from the list.



**1.  In the context of India's tribal population, which statement accurately reflects the distribution of Scheduled Tribes (STs)?**

(a) Odisha has the largest number of Scheduled Tribes in absolute terms.
(b) Madhya Pradesh possesses the highest concentration of STs in absolute numbers.
(c)  Arunachal Pradesh boasts the highest percentage of ST population.
(d) Lakshadweep has the highest percentage of ST population.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Odisha houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), Madhya Pradesh holds the distinction of having the largest Scheduled Tribe population in absolute terms.  This means that even though other states might have a higher percentage of their overall population belonging to Scheduled Tribes, Madhya Pradesh's sheer size and population contribute to a larger absolute number of ST individuals residing within its borders.  Options (a) and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the absolute versus percentage distribution of STs. Option (d) is partially correct, as Lakshadweep has a very high *percentage* of its population as STs, but this is not the highest absolute number.  The question highlights the crucial distinction between absolute numbers and percentages when analyzing demographic data, a key analytical skill required in the UPSC exam.


**2.  Which ministry is the nodal authority for addressing the welfare concerns of India's tribal communities?**

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Panchayati Raj


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the designated nodal ministry for all matters related to the welfare and development of tribal communities in India.  It is responsible for formulating policies, implementing schemes, and monitoring progress concerning various aspects of tribal life, including education, health, economic empowerment, and social justice.  Other ministries may have overlapping responsibilities in certain areas, but the Ministry of Tribal Affairs holds the primary and overarching authority in this domain.  The options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as their mandates are focused on broader aspects of governance than the specific needs and challenges faced by tribal communities.  Understanding the specific roles and responsibilities of different ministries is a critical element of UPSC preparation, demanding factual recall and an understanding of the Indian administrative structure.


**3.  The term "PVTGs" denotes a specific category within the Scheduled Tribes. What does this acronym stand for?**

(a) Primitive Tribal Groups
(b) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups
(c) Protected Tribal Groups
(d) Prioritized Vulnerable Tribal Groups


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs stands for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups. This is a special category of Scheduled Tribes (STs) that are recognized by the Indian government based on their pre-agricultural level of technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  The term was changed from "Primitive Tribal Groups" (PTGs) in 2006 to reflect a more nuanced and sensitive understanding of these communities.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either use outdated terminology or misrepresent the criteria used for identifying these groups.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of government classifications and policies regarding vulnerable populations.


**4. Which of the following criteria is NOT used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High level of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) Declining or stagnant population


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The identification of PVTGs relies on several factors indicating their vulnerability.  A pre-agricultural level of technology, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population are all key indicators.  However, a *high* level of literacy is not a criterion for PVTG identification; in fact, the opposite—low literacy—is a defining characteristic. The question assesses conceptual understanding of the criteria and requires the candidate to identify the outlier among plausible distractors. This tests the ability to analyze information and understand the nuances of government classifications.


**5.  The Dhebar Commission, a significant body in the history of tribal welfare in India, was primarily tasked with:**

(a) Defining the criteria for Scheduled Castes
(b) Recommending measures for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes
(c) Formulating policies for rural development
(d) Establishing the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Dhebar Commission, officially known as the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, was established in 1960-61 to examine the problems faced by Scheduled Tribes and recommend measures for their upliftment.  While other commissions and acts deal with other aspects of social welfare, the Dhebar Commission specifically focused on tribal welfare. The question tests factual recall and knowledge of historical commissions related to social policy.  The other options are incorrect as they represent the mandates of other government bodies.


**6.  Which state in India has the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Jharkhand


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs among all Indian states.  While other states also have significant PVTG populations, Odisha's count surpasses all others.  The question assesses factual recall of specific data points related to the geographical distribution of vulnerable populations.  The other options, though containing states with significant tribal populations, are incorrect as they do not have the highest number of PVTGs.


**7.  The "Panchsheel Principles" are a set of guidelines for tribal development. Which of the following is NOT a core tenet of these principles?**

(a) Respect for tribal rights to land and forests
(b) Imposition of alien values on tribal communities
(c) Development aligned with tribal genius
(d) Training tribal teams in administration and development


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Panchsheel Principles emphasize development that respects tribal cultures and traditions, avoids the imposition of external values, and promotes self-governance.  Imposing alien values directly contradicts this core principle.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are all core elements of the Panchsheel Principles, outlining a respectful and participatory approach to tribal development.  This question tests conceptual understanding of the principles and the ability to identify a contradictory statement.


**8.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently highlighted the need for the implementation of a specific commission's report related to a vulnerable group. Which commission's report is this?**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.  The difficulty is achieved through plausible distractors and nuanced options.


**1.  Considering the criteria for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India, which of the following factors is NOT a primary criterion for their designation?**

(a)  Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b)  High levels of literacy and education
(c)  Economic backwardness
(d)  A declining or stagnant population


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The identification of PVTGs hinges on their vulnerability, characterized by pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  High literacy and education would indicate a degree of social and economic progress, counteracting the very definition of a PVTG.  The other options directly reflect the established criteria used by the Indian government to identify these vulnerable groups.  Understanding the underlying rationale behind PVTG designation is crucial for comprehending government policies and initiatives aimed at their welfare.  The focus is on communities that require special attention due to their extreme socio-economic disadvantages and precarious existence.  Option (b) directly contradicts this fundamental principle.


**2. Which of the following statements accurately reflects the relationship between Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and Nomadic Tribes (NTs) in India?**

(a)  All DNTs are NTs, but not all NTs are DNTs.
(b)  All NTs are DNTs, but not all DNTs are NTs.
(c)  DNTs and NTs are entirely separate and distinct groups with no overlap.
(d)  The terms DNT and NT are interchangeable and refer to the same population group.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The crucial distinction lies in the historical context.  Denotified Tribes were labeled "criminal tribes" during British rule, a designation that has since been repealed. However, many DNTs are also nomadic or semi-nomadic in their lifestyle.  Therefore, all DNTs fall under the broader category of nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes were historically categorized as DNTs.  Understanding this historical context and the nuances of social categorization in India is vital for a comprehensive grasp of the social dynamics and policy challenges related to these communities. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the complex relationship between these groups.


**3.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates which of the following EXCEPT:**

(a)  Reservation for PwDs in government jobs (at least 4%).
(b)  Reservation for PwDs in government-aided higher educational institutions (at least 5%).
(c)  Mandatory reservation for PwDs in all police forces across India.
(d)  Free education for children with benchmark disabilities (ages 6-18).


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act aims to ensure inclusivity and equal opportunities for persons with disabilities.  The Act specifies reservation quotas in government jobs and higher education institutions.  It also guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities. However, a key exception is the exclusion of police forces from the mandatory reservation clause.  This exemption reflects the specific operational requirements and considerations within law enforcement agencies.  The other options accurately represent the provisions of the RPwD Act, focusing on the rights, access, and inclusivity of PwDs in various spheres of life.


**4.  Which of the following is NOT a primary objective of the Anganwadi Services Scheme in India?**

(a)  Improving the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years).
(b)  Reducing incidences of mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition among targeted groups.
(c)  Providing vocational training and higher education opportunities for adult women.
(d)  Improving the nutritional status of pregnant women and lactating mothers.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Anganwadi Services Scheme primarily focuses on the holistic development and well-being of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  Its core objectives revolve around improving nutrition, health, and reducing malnutrition-related issues.  While the scheme indirectly contributes to women's empowerment, providing vocational training and higher education is not its primary or direct objective.  The other options directly align with the scheme's fundamental goals of addressing early childhood development and maternal health.  Understanding the specific mandate of the Anganwadi system is crucial for analyzing its impact on India's overall health and social development indicators.


**5. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) in India has the primary mandate of:**

(a)  Providing financial assistance and healthcare to DNT communities.
(b)  Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
(c)  Implementing rehabilitation programs for manual scavengers.
(d)  Monitoring the implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006.

**Explanation:** The NCDNT's core function is to systematically document and identify DNT communities across different states.  This involves compiling a comprehensive state-wise list of castes that fall under this category. While the commission's work indirectly supports welfare initiatives, its primary mandate is focused on accurate identification and documentation.  Options (a), (c), and (d) describe different government programs and responsibilities that are not the direct mandate of the NCDNT.  This question tests the understanding of the specific roles and responsibilities of various governmental bodies involved in the welfare of marginalized communities.


**6. Which of the following parameters is NOT included in the Global Gender Gap Index released annually by the World Economic Forum?**

(a)  Economic Participation and Opportunity
(b)  Educational Attainment
(c)  Environmental Sustainability
(d)  Political Empowerment


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Gender Gap Index assesses gender equality across four key dimensions: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.  Environmental sustainability is not a direct parameter of the index, although gender disparities might influence environmental outcomes.  The index focuses on the relative gaps between men and women within these specific domains.  Understanding the composition and scope of the index is essential for interpreting its findings and their implications for policy-making.

(c)  Proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.
(d)  Flexibility and choice in subject selection at the secondary stage.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE proposes a restructured schooling system and advocates for multiple exit points, allowing students to take board examinations on at least two occasions during a school year, retaining the best score.  The framework emphasizes multilingualism, flexibility in subject choices at the secondary level, and a holistic approach to learning. Option (b) contradicts this flexibility and choice.  This question tests the understanding of the key features and recommendations of the NCF-SE and its implications for India's school education system.


**9.  Which of the following statements regarding the  "sandbox technique" used in the construction of the Ramappa Temple is INCORRECT?**

(b)  It was a marvel of ancient engineering.
(c)  It was solely used for the construction of the gopuram.
(d)  The Kakatiya dynasty adopted the Chalukyan style of Vesara architecture.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "sandbox technique" was a sophisticated foundation method employed throughout the Ramappa Temple's construction, not limited to the gopuram (tower).  The use of sand, lime, jaggery, and karakkaya created a stable and durable base.  The Kakatiya dynasty's architectural style, incorporating elements of Chalukyan Vesara architecture, is well-documented.  The other options accurately reflect the information about the temple's construction.


**10.  The  "Triple Threat Report" released by UNICEF examines which of the following combinations of risks faced by children?**

(a)  Malnutrition, lack of access to clean water, and conflict.
(b)  Limited access to basic water and sanitation services, high burden of WASH-related deaths, and high risk of climate and environmental hazards.
(c)  Child labor, child marriage, and lack of education.
(d)  Poverty, disease, and lack of healthcare access.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** UNICEF's "Triple Threat Report" specifically focuses on the combined challenges of inadequate WASH services (water, sanitation, and hygiene), a high death toll due to unsafe WASH conditions, and the amplified risks posed by climate change and environmental hazards.  This combination represents a unique and interconnected set of threats affecting children's well-being.  The other options address important child-related concerns but do not reflect the specific focus of the "Triple Threat Report."


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in education, higher education, and related organizations.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills.

**1.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for a significant restructuring of the school education system.  Which of the following is NOT a core element of this restructuring?**

(a) A 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.
(b)  The integration of vocational education seamlessly into the academic curriculum.
(c)  A rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects to maintain educational standards.
(d)  Emphasis on multilingualism, with proficiency in at least three languages.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE explicitly aims to break down the traditional barriers between academic and vocational streams, promoting a more holistic and flexible approach to education. Options (a) and (d) are directly mentioned as key features of the NCF-SE's restructuring. Option (b) reflects the framework's integrated approach to vocational training.  Option (c), however, is incorrect because the NCF-SE actively works against rigid separations, aiming for a more integrated and flexible system that allows students to pursue their interests across different disciplines. This integrated approach is central to the policy's vision of a more inclusive and relevant education system.  The removal of rigid boundaries allows for greater student choice and better alignment with the diverse needs and aspirations of learners.


**2. The Performance Grading Index (PGI) and PGI-D are used to evaluate the performance of the school education system in India. Which statement about their methodology is accurate?**

(a)  PGI relies solely on subjective teacher evaluations to assess overall school performance.
(b)  PGI-D focuses exclusively on the infrastructure of schools and not on teaching methodologies.
(c)  Both PGI and PGI-D utilize data from UDISE+ and NAS to inform their rankings.
(d)  PGI uses a five-point grading scale to rank states and districts.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both PGI and PGI-D explicitly use data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) as the foundation for their assessment of school education systems at state and district levels respectively. Option (a) is incorrect because PGI uses objective data, not subjective teacher evaluations. Option (b) is incorrect; PGI-D encompasses a broader range of factors including classroom transactions and school safety, not just infrastructure. Option (d) is incorrect; the PGI uses a ten-point grading scale, not a five-point scale. The reliance on UDISE+ and NAS data ensures a degree of objectivity and standardization in the assessment process, although the indicators used within these datasets themselves might be subject to debate and refinement.

(b)  It creates a single, unified framework to integrate credits earned through various educational pathways.
(c)  It focuses solely on higher education, neglecting vocational and skill-based training.
(d)  It eliminates the need for formal qualifications, replacing them with a purely credit-based system.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF's central purpose is to create a cohesive and flexible system that allows students to accumulate and transfer credits earned through diverse educational avenues, including school, higher education, vocational training, and skill development. Option (a) is incorrect because flexibility is a key feature of the NCrF. Option (c) is incorrect; a crucial aspect of the NCrF is the integration of vocational and skill-based training. Option (d) is incorrect; the NCrF complements, rather than replaces, formal qualifications, providing a more flexible and adaptable pathway for learners. This integrated approach acknowledges the diverse learning pathways available to individuals and aims to remove barriers to educational and professional mobility.  The framework envisions a system where learning is recognized and valued regardless of the setting in which it occurs.

(d)  DtbUs are required to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 regulations grant DtbUs greater autonomy, allowing them to introduce new courses with the approval of their Executive Council and relevant statutory councils. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all salient features of the updated regulations. Option (c) is incorrect; the regulations aim to provide more flexibility and autonomy to DtbUs to develop their curricula, fostering innovation and responsiveness to the changing demands of the higher education landscape.  The increased autonomy is intended to encourage innovation and improve the quality of higher education offerings.  However, the regulations still require adherence to relevant quality assurance standards and safeguards.


**6.  The  UGC [Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India] Regulations, 2023,  aims to attract top global universities to India. Which restriction is imposed on FHEIs operating in India under these regulations?**

(c)  FHEIs must obtain UGC approval before establishing campuses or offering programs.
(d)  FHEIs are free to set their fees without any regulatory constraints.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The regulations mandate that FHEIs must secure UGC approval before establishing campuses, introducing programs, or discontinuing any courses.  Options (a) and (d) are incorrect; while FHEIs have significant autonomy, they are still subject to regulatory oversight to ensure compliance with Indian standards and laws. Option (b) is incorrect; the regulations specifically prohibit online or distance learning programs. The requirement for UGC approval is a key safeguard to ensure that FHEIs adhere to Indian educational standards, maintain academic quality, and operate within the legal framework of the country.  This balance between attracting top global institutions and safeguarding national interests is a core principle of the regulations.


**7.  The  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has several key objectives for higher education in India. Which of the following is NOT a stated aim of NEP 2020 regarding higher education?**

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index focuses on economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all parameters included in the index. Option (c) is incorrect; while environmental issues are increasingly important in global development discussions, they are not currently a parameter within the framework of the Global Gender Gap Index.  The index's current parameters are designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of gender equality in key areas of human development, focusing on the disparities between men and women in access to resources, opportunities, and power.


**9.  The  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a significant initiative under the NEP 2020. Which statement accurately reflects its primary function?**

(a)  It provides financial aid to students pursuing higher education.
(b)  It digitally stores academic credits earned from various institutions.
(c)  It assesses the quality of teaching in different educational institutions.
(d)  It offers online courses and certifications to students.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ABC serves as a digital repository for academic credits earned by students from diverse educational institutions. Option (a) is incorrect; ABC does not provide financial assistance.

(b)  The surge in food prices due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical conflicts.
(c)  The significant improvement in global food security in recent years.
(d)  The projected increase in undernourishment due to climate change.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IFPRI report highlighted the worsening global food security situation, not its improvement. Options (a), (b), and (d) were all major concerns discussed in the report. Option (c) is incorrect; the report emphasized that food insecurity has been worsening, not improving, due to a complex interplay of factors including climate change, conflict, and economic instability.  The report served as a call for a rethinking of food crisis responses, urging for more proactive and comprehensive strategies to address the growing challenges to global food security.


**1.  Which statement accurately reflects the characteristics of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a) PVTGs are identified based solely on their pre-agricultural technology.
(b) Odisha has the lowest number of PVTGs in India.
(c) The term "PVTGs" replaced "PTGs" in 2006.
(d)  All tribal groups with low literacy rates are classified as PVTGs.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the government of India officially changed the designation of Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in 2006.  While pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population are criteria used for identifying PVTGs, they are not the sole determinants (a is incorrect). Odisha houses the highest, not the lowest, number of PVTGs (b is incorrect).  Low literacy is a criterion, but not all tribes with low literacy are automatically classified as PVTGs; other factors are crucial (d is incorrect).  The comprehensive understanding of the criteria used to identify PVTGs is essential for a correct answer.


**2.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently emphasized the implementation of a specific commission's report.  Which commission's report is this?**

(a) Renke Commission
(b) UNDhebar Commission
(c) Idate Commission
(d) Mandal Commission

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NHRC's emphasis is on the implementation of the Idate Commission report, which recommended establishing a permanent commission for De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs) in India. The Renke Commission focused on nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes (a is incorrect). The UNDhebar Commission's recommendations led to the recognition of Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), which are now PVTGs (b is incorrect). The Mandal Commission dealt with Other Backward Classes (OBCs) (d is incorrect).  The question tests factual recall regarding the specific commission's report highlighted by the NHRC, requiring precise knowledge of recent developments concerning the rights of marginalized communities.


**3.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High levels of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) Declining or stagnant population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because high levels of literacy are not a criterion for identifying PVTGs.  In fact, low literacy is one of the key indicators of vulnerability within these groups. Options (a), (c), and (d) are all established criteria for identifying PVTGs, highlighting their pre-agricultural lifestyles, economic disadvantages, and demographic challenges.  The question tests the ability to identify a contrasting characteristic from a set of established criteria, requiring accurate recall and understanding of the PVTG identification process.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills, with detailed explanations provided.

**1.  A Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Madhya Pradesh, also recognized as a PVTG in Chhattisgarh, recently received Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. Identify this group.**

(a) Kamar
(b) Baiga
(c) Bharia
(d) Konda Reddi

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Bharia PVTG in Madhya Pradesh, also found in Chhattisgarh, received Habitat Rights.  While Kamar and Baiga are also mentioned as PVTGs in both states, the question specifically asks for the group that *recently* received these rights, which was the Bharia tribe. Konda Reddis are mentioned as a hunter/trapper group, not directly related to the Habitat Rights context.  Understanding the specific details presented in the text is crucial to answering this question correctly. The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern specific information from a larger body of text.


**2.  Which state in India boasts the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Andhra Pradesh

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are mentioned in the context of specific PVTGs receiving rights, but not as the states with the highest overall number. Andhra Pradesh is not mentioned in this context. This question tests factual recall of a specific statistic related to PVTG distribution.

(a) Renke Commission
(b) Dhebar Commission
(c) Idate Commission
(d) Mandal Commission

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage directly mentions the NHRC stressing the implementation of the Idate Commission's report regarding DNTs.  The Renke Commission is mentioned in relation to the number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, but not in the context of the NHRC's recommendation. The Dhebar Commission is related to the initial recognition of Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), while the Mandal Commission focused on Other Backward Classes (OBCs).  The question tests the ability to connect specific events and organizations based on their contextual relationship within the text.


**4.  Which ministry is the nodal authority for addressing the concerns of De-Notified Tribes (DNTs) in India?**

(a) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Rural Development
(d) Ministry of Home Affairs

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** While the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is mentioned in the context of Scheduled Tribes (STs), the passage explicitly states that the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment is involved in several schemes for DNTs, including the SEED scheme.  This demonstrates a need to carefully differentiate between different government bodies and their respective mandates. The question tests conceptual understanding and the ability to correctly identify the relevant ministry from the given information.


**5. Which Act is primarily responsible for banning manual scavenging in India?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(d) The Right to Education Act, 2009

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly mentions that manual scavenging is banned under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR). The other acts address different aspects of social justice and human rights but do not specifically target manual scavenging. This question tests factual recall of legislation related to a specific social issue.


**6. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates a specific percentage of reservation for PwDs in government jobs. What is this percentage?**

(a) 2%
(b) 3%
(c) 4%
(d) 5%

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that the RPwD Act mandates not less than 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs. It is important to note that this reservation is not applicable to certain police forces.  This tests factual recall of a specific numerical detail within the legislation.


**7.  Which international organization, in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), released the India Ageing Report 2023?**

(a) World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The text explicitly states that the UNFPA, in collaboration with IIPS, released the India Ageing Report 2023. The other organizations are involved in various development and humanitarian efforts, but not in the specific release of this report. This question tests factual recall and knowledge of international organizations involved in population studies.

(a) Ending unmet need for family planning
(b) Eradicating extreme poverty
(c) Ending preventable maternal death
(d) Ending gender-based violence and harmful practices

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNFPA's three zeros by 2030 targets are explicitly mentioned in the passage: family planning, maternal deaths, and gender-based violence.  Eradicating extreme poverty is a broader Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) but not specifically listed as a UNFPA target.  This question tests understanding of an organization's specific goals and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct objectives.

(a)  Accessibility
(b)  Sustainability
(c)  Efficiency
(d)  Innovation

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly lists Accessibility, Affordability, and Quality as the key dimensions of UHC.  While sustainability, efficiency, and innovation are important aspects of healthcare systems, they are not specifically identified as core dimensions of UHC in this context. This question assesses conceptual understanding of the definition of UHC.


**12. The "Triple Threat Report" released by UNICEF examines the combined impact of three WASH-related challenges faced by children. Which of the following is NOT one of the three challenges?**

(c) High prevalence of child malnutrition.
(d) High risk of climate and environmental hazards.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "Triple Threat" refers to limited WASH access, high WASH-related child mortality, and high climate/environmental risk.  Malnutrition is a significant problem, but it's not part of UNICEF's defined "Triple Threat" in this context. This question tests the ability to understand and recall specific information from reports and identify the specific factors included within a defined framework.


**13.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) proposes a new schooling structure. Which of the following represents this new structure in terms of age groups?**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assesses various cognitive skills, primarily factual recall and analysis.  The questions avoid direct reproduction of the source material and employ plausible distractors.

**1.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) mandates the establishment of which committee in organizations with 10 or more employees?**

(a)  District Complaints Committee
(b)  National Complaints Committee
(c)  Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)
(d)  Local Complaints Committee

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The POSH Act, 2013, explicitly requires organizations with 10 or more employees to constitute an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). This committee is responsible for receiving and investigating complaints of sexual harassment within the workplace. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they represent committees either at a different jurisdictional level or for different circumstances.  The ICC is a crucial element of the Act's mechanism for addressing sexual harassment at the workplace, ensuring a prompt and effective redressal system within the organization itself.  The establishment of the ICC demonstrates a commitment to preventing and addressing workplace sexual harassment, aligning with international best practices and legal frameworks aimed at safeguarding women's rights in the workplace.


**2.  According to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, a child is defined as a person who has not completed how many years of age?**

(a) 16 years
(b) 18 years
(c) 21 years
(d) 15 years

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, clearly defines a "child" as a person who has not completed 18 years of age. This definition is crucial in determining the legal framework and procedures applicable to children involved in the justice system.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they do not reflect the legal definition provided in the Act. The 18-year age limit is significant because it distinguishes between juveniles and adults in terms of legal responsibility and the types of proceedings they face.  This reflects international conventions and principles emphasizing the special protection and care required for children within the justice system.  The amendment introduced in 2015 also allows for the possibility of trying certain children aged 16-18 as adults under specific circumstances related to heinous offences, but the basic definition remains 18 years.


**3. Which Act aims to regulate and supervise Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) clinics and banks and prevent their misuse, thereby ensuring safe and ethical practices?**

(a)  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
(b)  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(c)  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021
(d)  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, specifically addresses the regulation and supervision of ART clinics and banks. Its primary goal is to prevent misuse of these technologies and ensure that ART services are provided safely and ethically.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, while related, focuses specifically on surrogacy practices. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, deals with a different area of social concern altogether. The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, addresses a separate legal domain. The comprehensive regulatory framework provided by the ART Act, 2021, is crucial for ensuring responsible and ethical practices in the field of assisted reproductive technologies, protecting the rights and well-being of individuals involved.


**4.  The  "Temple of Healing v. Union of India" judgment by the Supreme Court focused on which aspect related to children?**

(a)  Child labor eradication
(b)  Improving access to education for children with disabilities
(c)  Bringing children in Childcare Institutions (CCI) into the adoption pool
(d)  Strengthening the Juvenile Justice system for children in conflict with the law

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court's judgment in *Temple of Healing v. Union of India* specifically addressed the need to identify and bring children living in Childcare Institutions (CCI) whose parents haven't visited them for over a year, or who have unfit parents/guardians, into the adoption pool.  The judgment highlights the importance of collaborative efforts to expedite the adoption process for these children.  Options (a), (b), and (d) address other important child-related issues but are not the central focus of the *Temple of Healing* judgment.  The ruling underscores the urgent need to address the welfare of children in CCIs, ensuring their timely placement in suitable adoptive families.  This decision emphasizes the role of the state and various agencies in identifying and facilitating the adoption of such children, aligning with the broader goal of child welfare and protection.


**5. Which government scheme aims to provide free competitive exam coaching to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) students and provide health insurance to their families?**

(a)  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme
(b)  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs
(c)  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(d)  Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is specifically designed to provide comprehensive support to DNTs, including free coaching for competitive exams and health insurance for families. The other options are also government initiatives for the welfare of marginalized communities, but their focus is on different aspects of empowerment.  The SEED scheme is a significant step towards addressing the socio-economic challenges faced by DNT communities, focusing on education and healthcare as critical pillars of empowerment.  This targeted approach is designed to improve their overall well-being and enhance their opportunities for social and economic advancement.


**6.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 mandates a minimum reservation of what percentage in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities?**

(a) 2%
(b) 5%
(c) 4%
(d) 3%

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation of 4% in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities. This legal provision reflects a commitment to inclusive employment policies and aims to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal opportunities in the workforce.  The other options are incorrect and do not represent the legally mandated reservation percentage.  This reservation policy is a crucial step towards promoting inclusivity and ensuring that persons with disabilities are not discriminated against in the job market.  It aims to create a more equitable and just society where individuals with disabilities have the same opportunities as their non-disabled counterparts.  However, it's important to note that this reservation is not applicable to police forces.


**7. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prescribes a maximum punishment of how many years of imprisonment for violating its provisions?**

(a) 5 years
(b) 3 years
(c) 1 year
(d) 2 years

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, sets a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment for violating its provisions, which prohibit the employment of manual scavengers.  This Act is a crucial step towards eradicating this inhumane practice and ensuring the dignity and safety of those who have historically been forced into manual scavenging.  The other options do not reflect the legally prescribed maximum imprisonment term.  The Act aims to not only prohibit the practice but also provide rehabilitation opportunities for manual scavengers, ensuring their transition to alternative livelihoods. The stringent punishment reflects the gravity of the offense and the commitment to eliminating manual scavenging from Indian society.


**8.  Which organization released the “India Ageing Report 2023”?**

(a)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  National Family Health Survey (NFHS)
(d)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), released the “India Ageing Report 2023”. This report provides valuable insights into the demographic changes and challenges related to an aging population in India.  The other options are involved in health and development work but did not release this specific report.  The report highlights the need for proactive policy measures to address the needs of India's growing elderly population, including healthcare, social security, and economic opportunities.  It serves as a crucial resource for policymakers and stakeholders to develop strategies for sustainable and inclusive development in the context of an aging society.


**9.  The  "Supriyo @ Supriya Chakraborty vs Union of India" case, decided by the Supreme Court, primarily dealt with which issue related to LGBTQIA+ rights?**

(a)  The right of transgender persons to adopt children
(b)  The right to same-sex marriage
(c)  The decriminalization of homosexuality
(d)  The right to gender affirmation surgery

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court case of *Supriyo @ Supriya Chakraborty vs Union of India* directly addressed the issue of legal recognition for same-sex marriages in India. The court's decision did not grant legal recognition to such unions. Other aspects of LGBTQIA+ rights, such as adoption rights, decriminalization of homosexuality (which already happened), and the right to gender affirmation surgery, were not the primary subject of this particular case.  The case highlights the ongoing legal and social debates around LGBTQIA+ rights in India and the complexities involved in achieving legal equality for same-sex couples.  The judgment has implications for the future trajectory of LGBTQIA+ rights advocacy and the need for legislative reforms.


**10. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) emphasizes the development of which capacity in Science Education?**

(a)  Memorization of scientific facts
(b)  Capacities for scientific inquiry
(c)  Rote learning of scientific theories
(d)  Passive reception of scientific information

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE emphasizes the development of "capacities for scientific inquiry" in science education.  This approach prioritizes critical thinking, problem-solving, and hands-on learning over rote memorization or passive reception of information.  The other options represent less effective and outdated pedagogical approaches. The focus on scientific inquiry aligns with modern educational philosophies that prioritize active learning and the development of higher-order cognitive skills.  This approach aims to cultivate a deeper understanding of scientific concepts and methods and to foster a more engaged and informed citizenry.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  The questions are designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and analysis.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  A government initiative aims to completely mechanize sanitation work, including sewer cleaning, septic tank emptying, and waste disposal.  Which program best aligns with this objective?**

(a) Swachhta Udyami Yojana
(b) National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE)
(c) Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)
(d) Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NAMASTE scheme is explicitly designed to promote 100% mechanization in sanitation work, addressing the hazardous nature of manual scavenging.  Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for sanitation equipment but doesn't focus solely on mechanization. SRMS focuses on rehabilitating manual scavengers into alternative professions. PEMSR is a law prohibiting manual scavenging, not a program for mechanization.  Therefore, NAMASTE is the most appropriate answer. The question tests factual recall and understanding of government schemes.


**2.  A newly enacted law establishes a national research foundation to provide strategic direction for research in various fields, including natural sciences, engineering, and social sciences.  Which Act created this foundation?**

(b)  Impacting Research Innovation and Technology (IMPRINT) India Act
(c) Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023
(d) Fund for Improvement of S&T Infrastructure (FIST) Scheme Act

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Anusandhan NRF Act, 2023, specifically establishes the Anusandhan National Research Foundation.  The SERB Act, 2008, was repealed and subsumed into the NRF. IMPRINT India is a collaborative initiative, not a foundational act. The FIST scheme provides infrastructure support, not the foundational structure of research. The question tests factual recall and understanding of Indian government legislation related to research and development.

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High level of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) A declining or stagnant population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  PVTGs are identified based on pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. High literacy rates would contradict the vulnerability criteria. This question tests understanding of the criteria used for categorizing vulnerable groups.


**5.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is primarily responsible for which of the following tasks?**

(a) Implementing rehabilitation schemes for manual scavengers.

(c) Overseeing the implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006.
(d) Monitoring the educational progress of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCDNT's main mandate is to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes.  While other options involve related social issues, they are not the primary responsibility of the NCDNT.  This question tests the understanding of the specific functions of a particular government commission.


**6. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation percentage for PwDs in which of the following sectors?**

(a) Private sector employment
(b) Government jobs
(c) Private sector higher educational institutions
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.  It also mandates reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions but does not extend this to the private sector. This question tests the understanding of legal provisions related to disability rights.


**7.  Which Act primarily addresses the issue of manual scavenging in India and prescribes punishments for violations?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR)
(c) The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005
(d) The Right to Education Act, 2009

This framework aims to create a more holistic and flexible education system by integrating vocational education at various levels and removing rigid boundaries between academic and vocational streams. Option (a) is incorrect as the NCF-SE explicitly promotes flexibility and integration. Option (b) is incorrect because the NCF-SE suggests a move *towards* a semester system, not away from it. Option (c) is directly contradictory to the framework's emphasis on multilingualism and the use of Indian languages.


**2. The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education assesses various aspects of the school system.  Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of the PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22?**

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PGI 2.0 report explicitly states that *no* state or UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in 2021-22.  Options (a) and (d) are correctly described in the text. Option (b) accurately describes the grading system used. The contrast between the actual outcome (no state achieving "Daksh") and option (c) makes this a challenging question, testing factual recall.


**3. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to revolutionize the Indian education system. Which of the following is NOT a core principle underlying the NCrF?**

(a)  Seamless integration of credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education.

(d) The Act does not allow for any differentiation in the treatment of children based on the severity of the offense.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Juvenile Justice Act defines a 'child' as a person below 18 years. However, it allows for the assessment of children aged 16-18 accused of heinous crimes to determine if they should be tried as adults. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent aspects of the Act's provisions, particularly concerning the age of majority and the differential treatment of children based on offense severity.  The question assesses the understanding of the nuanced legal provisions of the Act.

(c) VSKs are primarily designed to track the number of teachers but not students.
(d) VSKs have a centralized helpdesk for grievance redressal for stakeholders in the school ecosystem.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** VSKs are designed to monitor various aspects of the school ecosystem, including students (enrollment, learning outcomes, dropouts) and projects/activities.  Options (a), (b), and (d) correctly represent the functions of VSKs. Option (c) is incorrect because VSKs track both students and teachers. The question tests the specific functions of VSKs within the broader NDEAR initiative.

(a) Accessibility of healthcare services.
(b) Affordability of healthcare services.
(c) Quality of healthcare services.
(d)  Geographic proximity of healthcare facilities.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

(a)  Access to higher education and vocational training for adolescent girls.
(b)  The nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
(c)  Financial inclusion and economic empowerment of women in rural areas.
(d)  The provision of digital literacy training to Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs).


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The core objective of the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme, formerly known as the Anganwadi Services Scheme, is to enhance the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. While the scheme also incorporates elements related to adolescent girls' development, digital inclusion, and economic empowerment, these are secondary objectives supporting the primary goal of improving the health and nutrition of the target group. Option (a) is too narrow, focusing only on a subset of the scheme's beneficiaries and objectives. Option (c) is not the primary focus. Option (d), while a component of the scheme's modernization, is not its primary goal. The scheme's emphasis on improving nutritional and health indicators, as evidenced by its inclusion under the Poshan Abhiyan, makes (b) the most accurate answer.


**2.  Which of the following initiatives directly contributes to achieving the goals of the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan by leveraging technology for efficient service delivery and monitoring?**

(a)  The Intensified Mission Indradhanush.
(b)  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM).
(c)  The Poshan Tracker mobile application.
(d)  The National Health Policy 2017.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Poshan Tracker mobile application is explicitly designed to aid Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) in efficient service delivery and monitoring under the Poshan Abhiyan.  It facilitates the dynamic identification of stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence among children and tracks nutrition service delivery.  The other options, while important for overall health and well-being, do not directly address the NNM's goal of improving the utilization of key Anganwadi services through technological means. The Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on immunization. The ABDM aims for broader healthcare access. The National Health Policy 2017 sets a broader policy framework.


**3. The 'Triple Threat Report' by UNICEF highlights which of the following interconnected challenges related to children's well-being?**

(a)  High rates of child mortality, malnutrition, and lack of access to quality education.
(b)  Inadequate WASH services, high burden of WASH-attributable deaths, and high risk of climate and environmental hazards.
(c)  Limited access to healthcare, gender inequality, and prevalence of child labor.
(d)  Prevalence of child marriage, lack of birth registration, and inadequate social protection programs.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNICEF 'Triple Threat Report' specifically focuses on the combined threats of inadequate Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) services, the high burden of deaths attributable to unsafe WASH among children under five, and the high risk of climate and environmental hazards. These three factors are presented as interconnected challenges negatively impacting children's health and well-being. The other options, while relevant to children's well-being, are not the specific focus of this particular UNICEF report.

(a)  Provide financial assistance to all sanitation workers in India.
(b)  Eliminate the practice of manual scavenging and rehabilitate those engaged in it.
(c)  Improve sanitation infrastructure in urban areas.
(d)  Raise awareness about the importance of hygiene and sanitation.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act focuses on eliminating the practice of manual scavenging and providing rehabilitation services to those previously involved in this hazardous occupation.  While the act indirectly supports improved sanitation infrastructure and awareness campaigns, its core goal is to address the issue of manual scavenging directly.


**10.  Which of the following is a key feature of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 concerning higher education?**

(a)  Elimination of all undergraduate degree programs.
(b)  Introduction of multiple exit options within undergraduate degree programs.
(c)  Reduction of the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education.
(d)  Prohibition of foreign universities from operating in India.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The NEP 2020 introduces multiple exit options within undergraduate degrees, allowing students to obtain certifications, diplomas, or bachelor's degrees after completing one, two, or three years of study, respectively. This provides flexibility and caters to diverse learning needs and career aspirations.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they contradict the NEP 2020's goals and provisions.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues and adhering to the specified criteria.  Each question aims for a difficult level, requiring precise factual recall and understanding.


**1.  The text discusses several vulnerable groups in India.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects the current status of a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG)?**

(a)  The highest number of PVTGs is located in Madhya Pradesh, due to its large overall tribal population.
(b)  The Kamar tribe, recognized as a PVTG, has recently been granted Habitat Rights in only Madhya Pradesh.
(c)  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, and a growing population.
(d)  Odisha currently houses the highest number of recognized PVTGs in India.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because the text explicitly states that Odisha has the highest number (13) of PVTGs. Option (a) is incorrect; while Madhya Pradesh has the highest *overall* ST population, Odisha leads in the number of PVTGs. Option (b) is incorrect; the Kamar tribe has been granted Habitat Rights in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Option (c) is incorrect; the criteria include a *declining or stagnant* population, not a growing one.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct concepts (overall tribal population vs. PVTG population).

(d)  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT): Preparing a state-wise list of DNT castes.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is incorrect.  The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship specifically targets DNT students *not* covered under SC/ST/OBC categories. The other options correctly describe the primary objectives of the respective schemes. This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in descriptions of government programs, a key skill for UPSC aspirants.

(d) It establishes a Special Court in every district for faster adjudication of cases under the Act.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is incorrect. The Act provides free education for children with "benchmark disabilities," defined as those with at least 40% of a specified disability.  The other options accurately reflect provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016.  This question tests detailed knowledge of the Act and its specific provisions, highlighting the importance of understanding legal nuances for the exam.


**4. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) introduced several reforms. Which of the following is NOT a key highlight of the NCF-SE?**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India's education and social sectors.  Each question is designed to be challenging and tests factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.


**1.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) in India aims to achieve seamless integration of credits earned from diverse educational pathways. Which of the following is NOT a key component of this framework?**

(a)  A standardized credit system dividing education into eight levels, encompassing school, higher, and vocational education.

(c)  A system for recognizing and crediting experiential learning from industries, alongside formal education.
(d)  A mandatory requirement for all students to complete a minimum number of credit hours in each educational level before progressing.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NCrF seeks to provide flexibility and mobility between different educational pathways. While it uses a credit system and integrates various frameworks, it does *not* mandate a fixed number of credit hours for each level. The framework is designed to be inclusive and accommodate diverse learning experiences, allowing students to enter and exit the system at various points and accumulate credits through different means. Option (d) misrepresents the framework's flexibility and emphasis on diverse learning pathways. Options (a), (b), and (c) accurately reflect the NCrF's core components.


**2. The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee's recommendations on accreditation reforms for Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in India proposed several significant changes.  Which of the following is NOT among these recommendations?**

(a)  A transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited), moving away from a graded system.
(b)  The establishment of the National Accreditation Council (NAC) as a meta-accrediting body.
(c)  A composite assessment system amalgamating programme and institutional accreditation.
(d)  The immediate mandatory closure of all HEIs that fail to meet the new accreditation standards by December 2023.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Radhakrishnan Committee's recommendations aimed to improve the assessment and accreditation processes for HEIs.  While they advocated for a binary system, a composite assessment approach, and the establishment of the NAC, they did *not* recommend the immediate closure of non-compliant institutions. The committee suggested a transition period, allowing HEIs time to adapt to the new regime, even if the NAC's establishment was delayed.  Option (d) presents an unrealistic and drastic measure not included in the recommendations.

**4. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) introduced several key changes in India's school education system. Which of the following is NOT a core element of the NCF-SE?**

(a)  A shift to a 5+3+3+4 age-based curricular structure.
(b)  Emphasis on multilingualism, with students aiming for proficiency in at least three languages, including at least two Indian languages.
(c)  The integration of vocational education into the mainstream curriculum, starting at the secondary level.
(d)  The complete elimination of board examinations for grades 10 and 12.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE advocates for significant changes, including a new age-based structure, multilingualism, and integrated vocational education. However, it *does not* propose the complete elimination of board examinations.  Instead, it suggests allowing students to take board exams twice a year, retaining the best score. Option (d) misrepresents the NCF-SE's approach to assessment.


**5.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education in India serves a crucial purpose. What is the primary goal of this index?**

(a) To rank states and districts based solely on student performance in national-level examinations.
(b) To provide financial incentives to high-performing states and districts in the education sector.
(c) To assess the overall performance of school education systems at the state and district levels, considering multiple factors beyond exam results.

(c)  India's GHI score indicated a "serious" level of hunger, with high rates of undernourishment, child stunting, and wasting.
(d) The GHI report methodology was universally accepted by the Indian government.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 2023 GHI report categorized India's hunger level as "serious," highlighting high rates of undernourishment, child stunting, and wasting. While there might have been some marginal improvement since 2015, the overall situation remains concerning.  The Indian government did raise objections to the report's methodology, indicating disagreement with some aspects. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the report's key findings and the government's response.


**7.  Several organizations play a significant role in addressing global and national challenges related to population, health, and development. Which of the following organizations released the India Ageing Report 2023?**

(a)  The World Bank
(b)  The World Health Organization (WHO)

These three factors create a complex threat to children's well-being. The other options, while important, do not represent the specific "triple threat" identified in the report.


**1.  Which framework seamlessly integrates credits from school, higher, vocational, and skill education, aiming for flexibility and mobility among them?**

(a) National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(b) National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(c) National Credit Framework (NCrF)
(d) National Curriculum Framework (NCF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is explicitly designed to unify and integrate the credit systems of school, higher, vocational, and skill education.  This integration allows for the accumulation and transfer of credits earned in one type of education towards another, promoting flexibility and mobility for learners.  The other options, while relevant to education in India, do not encompass this holistic integration of credits across different educational pathways. NSQF focuses on skills, NHEQF on higher education, and NCF on the school curriculum, each operating within its own framework.  The NCrF's unique contribution is its meta-framework nature, binding these separate systems together under a single credit system.  This facilitates lifelong learning by allowing students to seamlessly transition between different educational and vocational paths based on their individual needs and aspirations.  This aligns with the broader goal of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 to create a more flexible and adaptable education system.

(a) UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b) UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(c) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d) World Food Programme (WFP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is explicitly named in the provided text as the organization that released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).  The other organizations listed, while involved in various aspects of population studies and development, are not directly associated with this specific report. UNDESA and UNCPD deal with broader population trends and development goals, while WFP focuses on food security. The UNFPA's mandate includes addressing population dynamics and reproductive health issues, making its involvement in a report on aging in India entirely consistent with its core functions.  The collaboration with IIPS, a leading Indian demographic research institution, further strengthens the credibility and relevance of the report within the Indian context.


**3. Which committee proposed reforms to the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions, accepted by the Ministry of Education?**

(a) The National Steering Committee
(b) The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee
(c) The Parliamentary Standing Committee on education, women, children, youth, and sports
(d)  The Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Ministry of Education accepted the proposed reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions as recommended by the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee. The other committees mentioned in the text have different mandates. The National Steering Committee focused on the National Curriculum Framework, the Parliamentary Standing Committee reviewed the NEP 2020 implementation, and the IAEG-SDGs deals with Sustainable Development Goals indicators. The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee's specific focus on accreditation reforms makes it the only appropriate answer.  The committee's recommendations likely involved crucial aspects like strengthening assessment processes, creating a roadmap for the National Accreditation Council (NAC), and proposing a transition to a new accreditation regime.  These reforms are central to improving the quality and standards of higher education in India.


**4.  Which Act seeks to repeal the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947, and establish a commission to regulate nursing and midwifery education and training?**

(a) National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019
(b) National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023
(c) National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023
(d)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023, is explicitly mentioned in the text as the legislation aiming to replace the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947, and establish a new regulatory body for nursing and midwifery education and training in India.  The other options are incorrect because they address different aspects of the healthcare system.  The NMC Act, 2019, pertains to medical education; the NDC Act, 2023, addresses dental education; and the Manual Scavengers Act focuses on a different social issue. The NNMC Act's specific focus on nursing and midwifery is crucial given the growing need to improve the quality and accessibility of nursing education and services in India, particularly in underserved areas.  The Act likely addresses issues like the shortage of nursing colleges and the low nurse-to-population ratio.


**5. Which index, released by the United Nations Development Programme, aims to understand systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women worldwide?**

(a) Global Gender Gap Index
(b) UHC Service Coverage Index
(c) Gender Social Norms Index
(d) Women’s Empowerment Index

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Gender Social Norms Index, released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), is specifically designed to measure the systematic disadvantages and discrimination against girls and women globally.  The other indices focus on different aspects of gender equality and development. The Global Gender Gap Index (World Economic Forum) assesses gender parity across various dimensions. The UHC Service Coverage Index (WHO and World Bank) tracks progress on health-related SDGs. The Women’s Empowerment Index (UN Women and UNDP) focuses on women's agency and freedoms. The Gender Social Norms Index uniquely targets the underlying social norms and attitudes that contribute to gender inequality, making it the most appropriate answer. This index likely considers factors such as access to education, economic opportunities, political participation, and physical safety.


**6. Which body monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by its State parties and issued guidance on children’s right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment for the first time?**

(a) UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b) UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(c) UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(d) World Food Programme (WFP)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) is the specific body that monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is mentioned in the text as having issued guidance on the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment for the first time.  The other organizations have different mandates. UNDESA focuses on broader economic and social development goals. UNCPD deals with population issues. The WFP concentrates on food security. The UNCRC's unique role in monitoring the Convention and its issuance of this groundbreaking guidance highlight its importance in safeguarding children's rights in the context of environmental sustainability.  This guidance likely addresses issues like the impact of climate change and pollution on children's well-being.


**7. Which organization, headquartered in Washington, D.C., released the Global Food Policy Report 2023: Rethinking food crisis responses?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), headquartered in Washington, D.C., is explicitly identified in the text as the author of the Global Food Policy Report 2023.  While the other organizations may contribute to research or policy discussions on food security, the IFPRI is specifically named as the source of this report.  The WFP is involved in food aid and distribution, UNFPA focuses on population and reproductive health, and CGIAR is a broader research partnership. The IFPRI's report likely addresses critical issues related to food crises, such as rising food prices, supply chain disruptions, and the impact of climate change.  The report's focus on rethinking crisis responses indicates a need for new strategies to address food insecurity effectively.


**8. Which of the following correctly describes the criteria for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  High levels of literacy and economic prosperity.
(b)  Pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a growing population.
(c)  Pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
(d)  Post-industrial technology, high literacy, economic advancement, and a stable population.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  Option (a) is the opposite of the actual criteria. Option (b) incorrectly states that PVTGs have a growing population; the text specifies a declining or stagnant population. Option (d) describes a group that is the opposite of PVTGs. The criteria for PVTGs highlight the extreme vulnerability and marginalization of these groups, requiring specific government attention and support to address their unique challenges.  These criteria are crucial for targeted interventions to improve their living standards, health, and education.


**9. Which government scheme aims to improve the educational empowerment of Denotified Tribes (DNTs) who are not covered under SC/ST/OBC categories?**

(a)  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme
(b)  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls
(c)  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(d)  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls is explicitly mentioned in the text as a centrally sponsored scheme designed to improve the educational empowerment of DNTs who are not covered under other reservation categories.  The other options address different social issues. The NCLP focuses on child labor rehabilitation. The SEED scheme addresses broader economic empowerment of DNT communities. The SRMS scheme is for manual scavengers. The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship directly targets educational access for DNTs, a crucial step in overcoming social and economic marginalization.  The scholarship's focus on pre-matric and post-matric levels ensures support throughout a student's education.


**10. Which Act prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all employment and also prohibits employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations?**

(a) Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(b) Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(d)  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, is specifically mentioned in the text as prohibiting the employment of children under 14 years in all employment and adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  The other options are incorrect. The Juvenile Justice Act focuses on the care and protection of children. The Manual Scavengers Act addresses a specific form of exploitative labor. The NCLP is a scheme rather than legislation. The Child Labour Amendment Act is a crucial piece of legislation for protecting children from exploitation and ensuring their right to education and development.  The Act's provisions for both children under 14 and adolescents in hazardous occupations demonstrate a comprehensive approach to combating child labor.

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b) UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c) UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(d) UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question points to the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees).  The report's title, "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022," directly aligns with the UNHCR's mandate: protecting refugees and those forcibly displaced.  The details provided—establishment in 1950, Geneva headquarters, and global operations—match the UNHCR's profile.  UNDESA (a) focuses on broader economic and social issues.  UNCPD (c) deals with population and development matters.  UNCRC (d) focuses on children's rights.

This deferral, the second in a row, cited concerns like political interference and inadequate cooperation with civil society.  What organization is responsible for accrediting the NHRC?**

(a) UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC)
(b) UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(c) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d)  International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description clearly refers to GANHRI (Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions). The text explicitly mentions GANHRI deferring the NHRC's accreditation due to concerns about political interference and cooperation with civil society. While the UNHRC (a) is involved in human rights, it does not directly accredit national institutions.  UNPFII (b) focuses on indigenous issues, and the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions (d) is an older name for GANHRI.  The answer hinges on understanding the role of GANHRI in establishing standards and accrediting national human rights institutions globally. This question tests knowledge of global governance structures and their impact on national institutions.


**4. The 22nd session of a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), established in 2000, focused on indigenous issues. This body consists of independent experts nominated by governments and indigenous organizations.  Which body held its 22nd session?**

(a) UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(b) UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(c) UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(d) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is the correct answer.  The prompt explicitly states that a body focusing on indigenous issues, established in 2000 and advising ECOSOC, held its 22nd session.  This directly points to the UNPFII.  The other options—UNCRC (a), UNCPD (b), and GANHRI (d)—deal with different subject areas: children's rights, population and development, and national human rights institutions, respectively.  The question tests knowledge of UN specialized agencies and their functions.  UPSC often examines the role of such bodies in international cooperation and policymaking.


**5. A 2023 report, "Rethinking Food Crisis Responses," analyzed global food insecurity, highlighting the impact of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war.

A global partnership established in 1971, focused on agricultural research for food security, is the parent organization of a major research center established in 1975, headquartered in Washington, D.C., and working in over 60 countries, including India.  What is the name of this parent organization?**

(a)  The World Bank
(b)  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
(d)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and its relationship with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). Option (a) is incorrect because the World Bank is a separate international financial institution. Option (b) is incorrect, as FAO is a specialized agency of the UN dealing with food and agriculture but not the parent organization of CGIAR. Option (d) is incorrect; UNDP is involved in development but not directly linked to CGIAR's agricultural research focus.  The key here is understanding the hierarchical relationship between CGIAR and IFPRI, a crucial aspect of international development organizations.


**2.  A report highlighting a 21% increase in forced displacement in 2022 compared to 2021, with 30% of displaced individuals being children, and 76% of the world's refugees hosted by low- and middle-income countries, was released by which organization?**

(a)  The International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b)  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières)
(d)  The World Health Organization (WHO)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the provided text explicitly states that IFPRI provides "research-based policy solutions for reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition." Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. While IFPRI's work might indirectly relate to sustainable tourism, international trade, or organic farming, its core mandate and primary focus as described are on poverty, hunger, and malnutrition reduction through policy research.  This aligns with its role within the CGIAR, a global partnership focused on food security. The other options represent different areas of international development, but they do not directly reflect IFPRI's main function.

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The passage clearly states that the UNHCR released the report in question. The WHO focuses on health issues, the IMF on economic matters, and the World Bank on development finance; none of these are directly associated with the release of a report on forced displacement.  Understanding the mandates of different UN agencies is key to correctly answering this question.  The distractors are plausible because they are all prominent international organizations dealing with global issues, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall the specific organization responsible for this particular report.

**Explanation:** The correct answer is (c) because the passage explicitly states that AWWs and AWHs are covered under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), and Anganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana (AKBY) insurance schemes. Option (a) is incorrect as AWWs receive a performance-linked incentive of ₹500 per month from the Centre in addition to their honorarium, and many states also provide additional honorariums. Option (b) is incorrect because, while the central government's honorarium is ₹4,500, a performance-linked incentive is also provided. Option (d) is incorrect as the passage notes that most states/UTs provide additional honorarium from their resources.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the Indian social welfare system.


**2. Which of the following accurately describes the key objectives of the Anganwadi Services Scheme (now Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0)?**

(c) To provide digital literacy training to all women in India.
(d) To solely focus on early childhood care and education for children aged 3-6 years.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Option (b) correctly identifies the primary objectives of the Anganwadi Services Scheme as outlined in the provided text.  The scheme aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and to reduce mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they present an incomplete or inaccurate representation of the scheme's goals.  While digital inclusion is a component of the Saksham Anganwadi initiative, it's not the sole objective. Similarly, while early childhood care and education are important aspects, they are not the only focus. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the scheme's scope.


**3.  The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan primarily aims to:**

(d)  Completely eliminate malnutrition in India within five years.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that the POSHAN Abhiyan aims to reduce stunting in identified districts with the highest malnutrition burden by improving the utilization of key Anganwadi Services. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.  While improved nutrition contributes to poverty reduction, it's not the primary goal of POSHAN Abhiyan.  Free healthcare is not the central focus, and complete malnutrition elimination within a short timeframe is unrealistic and not stated as an objective. The question assesses understanding of the NNM's specific goals and its relationship to other social programs.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are all mentioned as key features of the Saksham Anganwadi initiative. This question tests the understanding of the initiative's scope and limitations.


**5. According to the provided text, which organization released the report titled "Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)"?**

(a) UNICEF
(b) World Bank
(c) World Health Organization (WHO)
(d)  International Monetary Fund (IMF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the World Health Organization (WHO) released the report "Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)".  UNICEF is mentioned in relation to a separate report on WASH, while the World Bank is mentioned in the context of UHC. The IMF is not mentioned at all. The question tests factual recall of the report's source.

(d)  Save the Children and UNICEF


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text specifically names Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe as the organizations that released the GHI 2023.  The other options list other well-known NGOs but are not the ones responsible for publishing the specific report. This question assesses factual recall of the report's authors.


**8.  According to the GHI 2023, India's ranking among 125 countries and its categorization on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale are:**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India's education and social welfare systems.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring a deep understanding of the material.


**1.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI) 2.0, released by the Ministry of Education, assesses which aspects of the Indian school education system?**

(a)  Teacher training programs and curriculum development initiatives only.
(b)  The financial allocation and infrastructure development in schools only.
(c)  Student enrollment rates and teacher-student ratios only.
(d)  The performance of the school education system at the State and District levels, considering factors like UDISE+ data and NAS results.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PGI 2.0 is a comprehensive index designed to evaluate the overall performance of school education systems at both the state and district levels. It leverages data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) to provide a holistic assessment. Options (a), (b), and (c) are too narrow and do not encompass the broad scope of the PGI 2.0, which considers various factors related to educational outcomes, resource allocation, and infrastructure.  The index aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of school education systems across India.  Its multi-faceted approach makes it a crucial tool for policy-makers and educational administrators.


**2.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects a key finding of the PGI 2.0 report for the year 2021-22?**

(a)  All states and union territories achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").
(b)  Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram attained the highest grade ("Daksh").
(c)  No state or union territory achieved the highest grade ("Daksh"), and Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest attained grade of "Prachesta-2".
(d)  The deviation between the maximum and minimum scores remained unchanged from 2017-18.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22 highlighted a significant finding: no state or union territory reached the highest grade ("Daksh"). This underscores the ongoing challenges in achieving uniform educational standards across India.  Furthermore, the report specifically noted that Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest attained grade, which was "Prachesta-2".  Option (a) is incorrect because no entity reached the highest grade. Option (b) is incorrect as the mentioned states achieved the lowest grade. Option (d) is incorrect because the report actually showed a reduction in the deviation between the maximum and minimum scores compared to 2017-18. This signifies progress in narrowing the performance gap between better-performing and underperforming states/UTs.


**3. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least what percentage in higher education by 2035?**

(a) 25%
(b) 35%
(c) 45%
(d) 50%


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A key objective of the NEP 2020 is to significantly expand access to higher education.  The policy sets an ambitious target of achieving a GER of at least 50% by 2035. This demonstrates a commitment to increasing the number of students enrolled in higher education as a percentage of the eligible population (aged 18-23 years). Options (a), (b), and (c) are lower than the actual target set by the NEP 2020, underestimating the policy's ambition for expanding access to higher education.  Reaching this target would require substantial investment in higher education infrastructure, faculty development, and financial aid for students.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 placed the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore in the 201-250 bracket, making it the top-ranked Indian university in that particular ranking.  While IIT Bombay and IIT Madras are also prestigious institutions, they did not top the list of Indian universities in this specific ranking. Anna University was placed in a lower bracket. The ranking highlights the increasing global recognition of Indian institutions of higher learning, although it also underscores the need for continued improvement to compete with top global universities.


**5.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate credits earned through which educational pathways?**

(a)  Higher education only.
(b)  Vocational and skill education only.
(c)  School education only.
(d)  School education, higher education, and vocational and skill education.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF is a comprehensive framework designed to create a seamless system of credit accumulation and transfer across various educational pathways.  It aims to integrate credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education. This will enhance flexibility and mobility for learners, allowing them to switch between different educational programs and accumulate credits towards various qualifications. Options (a), (b), and (c) are too limited in scope and do not reflect the NCrF's goal of creating a unified credit system across diverse educational settings.  This integrated approach is a crucial aspect of the NEP 2020's vision for a more flexible and learner-centric education system.


**6.  The  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, introduced which significant change regarding the age of institutions eligible to apply for Deemed to be University (DtbU) status?**

(b)  Removed the age requirement entirely.
(c)  Reduced the minimum age requirement from 20 years to less than 20 years.
(d)  Maintained the minimum age requirement at 20 years.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A key change introduced by the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, was the reduction in the minimum age requirement for institutions applying for DtbU status.  Previously, institutions needed to be at least 20 years old. The new regulations allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply, opening up opportunities for younger, high-performing institutions to achieve DtbU status. Options (a) and (d) are incorrect because they state the opposite of the actual change.  Option (b) is also incorrect, as the regulations still have an age requirement, although significantly lowered. This change reflects a move towards recognizing and rewarding excellence in younger institutions.


**7.  Which ministry is the nodal ministry for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Home Affairs


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India.  It plays a crucial role in formulating and implementing policies and programs aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of ST communities.  While other ministries also contribute to ST welfare through various schemes, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs holds the primary responsibility. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they are not the primary nodal ministries for ST welfare.  The Ministry's role is critical in addressing the historical and ongoing challenges faced by ST communities in terms of access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.

(b)  Construct sanitary latrines.
(c)  Employ people as manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines.
(d)  Implement mechanized sanitation systems.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, explicitly prohibits the employment of individuals as manual scavengers. This is a crucial step towards eradicating this hazardous and dehumanizing practice. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they describe actions that are either permissible or actively encouraged under the Act.  Option (a) describes the use of protective gear, which is a requirement for safe sanitation work. Option (b) refers to the construction of sanitary latrines, a key goal of the Act. Option (d) describes mechanized sanitation, which is a solution to eliminate manual scavenging. The Act aims to provide rehabilitation and alternative employment opportunities for those previously engaged in manual scavenging.


**9. The  National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) is a collaborative initiative between which two ministries?**

(a) Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b) Ministry of Education and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology

(a) 4+4+4 design
(b) 5+3+3+4 design
(c) 6+3+3+3 design
(d) 5+4+3+4 design


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE proposes a significant restructuring of the school education system in India, moving from the traditional four-stage structure to a new 5+3+3+4 design based on age groups. This framework is aligned with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Options (a), (c), and (d) represent alternative age-based designs that are not consistent with the NCF-SE's proposed structure. The 5+3+3+4 design aims to create a more holistic and integrated curriculum that caters to the developmental needs of children at different age levels.  It emphasizes foundational learning in the early years and provides greater flexibility and choice in the later years.

This report provides crucial data and analysis on the global scale of forced displacement due to conflict, persecution, and other factors. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they are other UN agencies that address related but different aspects of global issues.  The UNHCR's report is a key resource for understanding the challenges faced by refugees and internally displaced persons worldwide and for informing policy responses to these complex issues.


**13. The  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 categorized India's level of hunger as:**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth understanding and knowledge.  The difficulty level is assessed as "difficult" for each.


**1.  Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India:**

I.  The highest number of PVTGs is found in Odisha.
II.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include a pre-agricultural level of technology and economic backwardness.
III.  The term PVTG replaced the earlier term Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 2006.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) I and II only
(b) I, II and III
(c) II and III only
(d) I and III only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct.  Statement I accurately reflects that Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs in India. Statement II correctly identifies two key criteria used to determine PVTG status: a pre-agricultural level of technology and economic backwardness. Other criteria include low literacy rates and a declining or stagnant population.  Statement III is true as the government officially changed the designation from PTGs to PVTGs in 2006.  The change aimed to reflect a more sensitive and respectful terminology.


**2. Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a)  Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b)  High level of literacy
(c)  Economic backwardness
(d)  Declining or stagnant population


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  While pre-agricultural technology, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population are all criteria used to identify PVTGs, a *high* level of literacy is the opposite of what is typically observed in these groups.  PVTGs are characterized by significantly lower literacy rates compared to the general population, highlighting their vulnerability and need for targeted support.

The NHRC's call for implementation refers to the Idate Commission report. This report specifically recommends the establishment of a permanent commission for De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs) in India.  These communities face unique challenges due to their historical marginalization and often lack access to basic rights and services.

(a) District Complaints Committee
(b) Local Complaints Committee

**Explanation:** The POSH Act explicitly requires organizations with 10 or more employees to form an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). This committee is responsible for investigating complaints of sexual harassment within the organization.

The committee's recommendations involved designating a specific percentage of the region as an ecologically sensitive area, aiming to strike a balance between environmental protection and economic activities.  The Gadgil Committee also addressed similar issues in the Western Ghats but with different recommendations. The other options are either inaccurate or refer to different committees focusing on environmental issues. The Kasturirangan Committee's report is significant because it directly addresses the complex challenges of balancing environmental protection and economic development in a crucial biodiversity hotspot.  Knowledge of this committee and its recommendations is vital for understanding environmental policy in India, a key aspect of the UPSC syllabus.

Which two UN agencies jointly produced this report?**

(a) UNICEF and WHO
(b) UNDP and UNFPA
(c) UN Women and UNDP
(d) UNHCR and UN DESA

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "Path to Equal" report was jointly produced by UN Women and UNDP.  The report introduced the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI), focusing solely on women's agency, and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI), comparing women's and men's status across key human development dimensions.  The other options are incorrect as they do not represent the correct partnership.  Understanding the methodologies and findings of this report is crucial for analyzing global gender equality trends and the status of women's empowerment, a vital topic in the UPSC syllabus.


**9. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) recently issued guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offenses under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.  What is the age limit defined for a "child" under this Act?**

(a) 16 years
(b) 18 years
(c) 21 years
(d) 14 years

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Home Affairs
(d) Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation

Option (a), WFP, is a separate UN agency focused on food assistance. Option (b), FAO, is another UN agency involved in food and agriculture, but it doesn't directly house IFPRI. Option (d), UNDP, is a UN development agency with broader mandates than IFPRI's specific focus on food policy.


**2. A 2022 report highlighted that forced displacement globally reached 108.4 million people due to conflict, persecution, and violence.  This report, focusing on forced displacement, was released by an organization established in 1950 with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.  Which organization published this report?**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description points to the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). The text explicitly mentions that UNHCR released the 'Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report', aligning perfectly with the question's description.  GANHRI (a) focuses on human rights institutions, UNPFII (c) on indigenous issues, and UNFPA (d) on population issues, making them unsuitable for a report on forced displacement.


**3.  An organization, established in 1993 and headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, deferred the accreditation of India's National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) due to concerns about political interference and lack of cooperation with civil society.  What is the name of this organization?**

(a) UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(b) UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(c) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d)  World Food Programme (WFP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question details describe the GANHRI (Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions).

**4.  A 2023 report, examining the impact of population shifts, the climate crisis, and disruptive technologies on children, was released by a UN agency initially established in 1980.  The report provides a comprehensive analysis of global trends affecting children. This report is associated with which organization?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
(c) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

**Explanation:** The description refers to UNICEF's (United Nations Children's Fund)  "State of the World's Children" report. The text explicitly mentions UNICEF's 1980 establishment and its focus on child welfare issues, aligning with the question.  WFP (a) focuses on food, UNHCR (c) on refugees, and IFPRI (d) on food policy research, making them inappropriate choices for a report on broad child welfare trends.


**5. In 2023, the Bihar state government released a report on a caste survey, an exercise described as a "social survey" focused on caste demographics.  This survey, conducted at the state level, contrasts with the regular decennial census in India, which is a Union subject under Article 246 of the Constitution. What is the main difference between the Bihar caste survey and the regular Indian census?**

(a) The Bihar survey focuses solely on religious demographics, while the census includes caste data.
(b) The Bihar survey is a state-level initiative, while the census is a nationwide Union subject.
(c)  The Bihar survey is conducted every five years, while the census is conducted every ten years.
(d) The Bihar survey collects data on economic conditions, while the census focuses only on population numbers.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The core difference lies in the jurisdictional level. The Bihar caste survey is a state-level initiative, whereas the regular Indian census falls under the Union List (a Union subject) and is conducted nationwide.  The other options misrepresent the nature and scope of both the Bihar survey and the national census.

(a) Global Hunger Index (GHI)
(b) Gender Social Norms Index
(c) Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI)
(d) Women’s Empowerment Index


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI). The provided text explicitly mentions these two indices and their respective focuses on women's empowerment and gender parity, making them the correct answer.  The other options list indices that address different aspects of development and do not constitute a pair of indices specifically designed to measure the status of women.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring detailed knowledge and analysis, and avoids direct replication of the source material.


**1.  A legal framework in India aims to regulate the practice of one woman bearing and giving birth to a child for an intending couple, prohibiting monetary compensation beyond basic medical expenses.  Which Act governs this practice, and what type of surrogacy does it primarily permit?**

(a) Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021; Commercial Surrogacy
(b) Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021; Altruistic Surrogacy
(c) Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971; Traditional Surrogacy
(d) Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956; Gestational Surrogacy


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, specifically addresses surrogacy in India.  It aims to prevent exploitation by strictly regulating the practice and prohibiting commercial surrogacy. The Act primarily permits altruistic surrogacy, where the surrogate mother receives no monetary compensation beyond medical expenses and insurance. Option (a) is incorrect because while the ART Act, 2021, is related to assisted reproductive technologies, it's the Surrogacy Act that specifically deals with the legal framework for surrogacy. Option (c) is incorrect as the MTP Act deals with abortion, a separate legal matter, although related in some circumstances to surrogacy. Option (d) is incorrect because the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act deals with adoption, a different legal process entirely.


**2.  A recent Supreme Court ruling denied a woman's plea to terminate a 26-week pregnancy, citing the absence of an immediate threat to the mother and lack of fetal abnormality. Which Act primarily governs the legal framework for medical termination of pregnancy in India, and what is a key consideration in determining the legality of such a procedure?**

(a) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021; gestational age of the fetus
(b) The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016; the health of the mother
(c) The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971; the health of both mother and fetus
(d) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015; the age of the mother


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, governs abortion in India. While the Act has been amended to increase access, a key consideration remains the health of both the mother and the fetus. The court's decision highlights this balancing act.  Option (a) is incorrect as it refers to surrogacy, not abortion. Option (b) is incorrect as it focuses on disability rights, not abortion. Option (d) is incorrect because it concerns juvenile justice, unrelated to the legal framework for abortion.


**3.  The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) recently issued guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offenses, as defined under a specific Act.  Which Act is this, and what is a key distinction it makes concerning the treatment of children involved in serious crimes?**

(a) The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956;  age of criminal responsibility
(b) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015;  differentiation between heinous and petty offenses
(c) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012;  mandatory reporting of offenses
(d) The Right to Education Act, 2009; compulsory education until age 14


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, governs the treatment of children in conflict with the law.  A key aspect is its differentiation between heinous offenses (potentially leading to adult court proceedings for older juveniles) and other offenses.  The NCPCR guidelines directly relate to this distinction. Option (a) is incorrect because it focuses on immoral trafficking. Option (c) is incorrect as it specifically addresses sexual offenses against children. Option (d) is incorrect; it concerns the right to education, not juvenile justice.


**4.  A government initiative aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers by leveraging a network of community-based centers.  What is the name of this initiative, and what is its primary implementing agency?**

(d) National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyaan); NITI Aayog


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme is a flagship program of the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  It uses a network of Anganwadi Centers to provide services focused on improving the nutritional and health status of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Option (a) is incorrect as it's a broader health insurance scheme. Option (c) is also incorrect; it's another health insurance program. Option (d) is incorrect, though related to nutrition, POSHAN Abhiyaan operates *within* the ICDS framework.


**5.  A recent report highlighted the need to implement recommendations from a specific commission regarding the welfare of communities historically labeled as "criminal" during British rule. Which commission is this, and what is the primary group it focuses on?**

(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); promoting sexual and reproductive health
(c)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); sustainable development
(d)  World Health Organization (WHO); global health


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is the organization that released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with IIPS.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and demands precise factual recall and analysis.


**1.  The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India is found in which state?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Andaman and Nicobar Islands
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The passage explicitly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, the question specifically asks about PVTGs, a distinct category within Scheduled Tribes.  Chhattisgarh shares some PVTGs with Madhya Pradesh, but neither state has the highest overall number of PVTGs. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have PVTGs, but fewer than Odisha.  The question tests factual recall of a specific statistic related to tribal populations in India.


**2. Which government act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, impacting the legal status of Denotified Tribes (DNTs)?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955
(c) The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly indicates that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which negatively categorized certain communities, was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952.  The other options are related to social justice and protection of marginalized communities but do not address the specific repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act. This question assesses knowledge of historical legislation impacting the DNT community and their legal framework.


**3.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates a minimum reservation percentage in which of the following sectors?**

(a) Private sector employment
(b) Government jobs and government-aided higher educational institutions
(c) Judiciary and legislative bodies
(d) Armed forces and paramilitary forces

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act, 2016, specifically mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and not less than 5% reservation in government/government-aided higher educational institutions.  The act does not directly address reservation in the private sector, judiciary, legislature, or the armed forces, which are subject to separate regulations and policies. This question tests the understanding of specific legal provisions concerning disability rights in India and their application in different sectors.


**4.  The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate which specific practice?**

(a) Open defecation
(b) Manual scavenging
(c) Unsanitary waste disposal in urban areas
(d) Use of traditional latrines in rural areas

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly mentions the National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem's goal of eliminating hazardous cleaning and preventing deaths of sewer and septic tank workers, which directly relates to the elimination of manual scavenging. While the policy indirectly addresses open defecation and other sanitation issues, its primary focus is on ending the practice of manual scavenging. This question tests the understanding of specific government initiatives targeting a particular social issue.


**5. Which of the following is NOT a criterion used for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High level of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) Declining or stagnant population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage lists the criteria for identifying PVTGs as pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and declining/stagnant population.  High literacy is the opposite of one of the stated criteria. This question tests the ability to identify exceptions within a set of defined criteria.


**6.  The "Prayatna" project, highlighted in a NITI Aayog report, focuses on providing which type of support to the transgender community?**

(a) Healthcare and medical assistance
(b) Legal aid and advocacy
(c) Livelihood and enterprise training
(d) Housing and shelter provisions

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage specifies that the Prayatna project is a livelihood and enterprise training program for transgender people. While other support initiatives exist for the transgender community, the Prayatna project specifically targets skill development and economic empowerment. This question tests the understanding of specific government programs targeting marginalized communities.


**7.  According to the passage, which act defines a “child” as a person who has not completed 18 years of age?**

(a) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age. While other acts deal with children's rights and protection, the JJ Act specifically provides this definition. This question focuses on precise legal definitions related to child welfare legislation.


**8. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced which significant change regarding the use of donor gametes?**

(a) Completely banned the use of donor gametes in surrogacy.

(c) Allowed the use of donor gametes for all intending couples.
(d) Restricted the use of donor gametes only to married couples.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage states that the 2024 amendment allows surrogacy using donor gametes only when the intending couple has a medical condition necessitating it, and at least one gamete must be from the intending couple. This clarifies a previous prohibition and highlights the nuanced approach to regulating surrogacy.  This question tests understanding of recent amendments to surrogacy laws in India.


**9.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate credits earned through which educational pathways?**

(a) Higher education only
(b) School education and higher education only
(c) School education, higher education, and vocational/skill education
(d) Vocational/skill education only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that the NCrF aims to seamlessly integrate credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational & skill education. This holistic approach is central to the framework's design. This question tests the understanding of the NCrF's comprehensive scope.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1.  Considering the socio-economic characteristics used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), which of the following would be LEAST likely to be classified as a PVTG?**

(a) A tribe with a high rate of population decline and limited access to modern healthcare.
(b) A tribe predominantly engaged in subsistence farming with low literacy rates.
(c) A tribe with advanced agricultural techniques and high levels of technological adoption.
(d) A tribe exhibiting economic backwardness and a stagnant population.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. Option (c) directly contradicts these criteria by describing a tribe with advanced agricultural techniques and high technological adoption, indicating a higher level of socio-economic development than what characterizes PVTGs. Options (a), (b), and (d) all align with at least one or more of the defining characteristics of PVTGs, making them more likely candidates for classification.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills in understanding the defining characteristics of PVTGs.


**2.  The Idate Commission report, highlighted by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), focused on which specific marginalized group in India?**

(a) Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b) Scheduled Tribes (STs)
(c) De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)
(d) Other Backward Classes (OBCs)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The news excerpt explicitly mentions the NHRC's emphasis on implementing the Idate Commission report's recommendations concerning De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs). This directly points to option (c) as the correct answer. The other options represent different marginalized groups in India, but they are not the specific focus of the Idate Commission report as highlighted in the context. The question tests factual recall regarding the specific group addressed by a particular commission report.


**3.  Which state in India has the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Andhra Pradesh


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that Odisha has the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of STs, this question specifically targets the number of PVTGs, a distinct sub-category within STs.  Chhattisgarh shares some PVTGs with Madhya Pradesh, but neither holds the highest overall number.  Andhra Pradesh is not mentioned as having a significant number of PVTGs. The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between different tribal classifications.

(d)  People with disabilities facing societal discrimination.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 'notified' communities later known as Denotified Tribes (DNTs) as "born criminals."  The Act's repeal highlights its negative historical impact on this specific group. While other options might face marginalization, the Act directly targeted DNTs.

(a) Private sector employment
(b) Government jobs
(c) Private sector higher education institutions
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The provided text specifies that the RPwD Act, 2016, mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with disabilities.  It does not mandate reservation in the private sector, either for employment or higher education.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the Act's reservation mandate.  The question tests detailed knowledge of specific legislation related to disability rights.

(c)  The Bharia PVTG is exclusively located in Madhya Pradesh.
(d)  Odisha currently houses the largest number of PVTGs in India.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that Odisha currently has the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. Option (a) is incorrect; the text indicates Odisha, not Arunachal Pradesh, holds this distinction. Option (b) is incorrect because the criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population—the opposite of what is stated in the option. Option (c) is incorrect as the text mentions the Bharia PVTG is present in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  This question tests factual recall and requires careful attention to detail within the provided information.


**2. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently highlighted the need for the implementation of a specific commission's report.  Which commission's report is this?**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions the NHRC's emphasis on implementing the Idate Commission report regarding DNTs.  Option (a) is incorrect; while the Renke Commission is mentioned, it's not the focus of the NHRC's recent statement. Option (c) is incorrect; the UNDhebar Commission is related to PVTGs, not DNTs.  Option (d) is incorrect; the Sarkaria Commission deals with Centre-State relations, a topic outside the immediate context. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the specific context of the NHRC's statement.


**3.  Which of the following is NOT a measure undertaken by the Indian government for the welfare of Denotified Tribes (DNTs)?**

(a)  The establishment of the National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT).

(c)  The implementation of the "SEED" scheme for economic empowerment.
(d)  The exclusive reservation of government jobs for DNTs, irrespective of other quotas.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text details several government initiatives for DNT welfare, including the NCDNT, scholarships, and the SEED scheme.  However, it does not mention any exclusive reservation for DNTs in government jobs, separate from existing SC/ST/OBC quotas.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all mentioned as government initiatives for DNT welfare. This question assesses factual recall and the ability to identify information *not* present in the text.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act focuses on the rights and inclusion of PwDs, including reservation, special courts, and free education. Option (c) is incorrect; the Act promotes inclusion, not a ban on employment.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all direct mandates of the RPwD Act as described in the text. This question tests understanding of the Act's provisions and the ability to identify a statement that contradicts its aims.


**5.  Which of the following statements concerning the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) is FALSE?**

(c)  The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.
(d)  The Act defines manual scavengers, including those working as sweepers in government or private organizations.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act addresses the issue of manual scavenging, criminalizing the practice and providing rehabilitation measures.  Option (b) is incorrect; while the Act aims to eliminate insanitary latrines, it doesn't mandate their immediate demolition within a fixed timeframe.  It focuses on gradual conversion to sanitary latrines. Options (a), (c), and (d) accurately reflect the Act's provisions as described in the text. This question evaluates understanding of the nuances of the legislation.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE proposes significant changes to the school education system, including the age-based structure, multilingualism, and subject flexibility. Option (b) is incorrect; the NCF-SE does *not* eliminate board examinations but allows students to take them on multiple occasions. Options (a), (c), and (d) are features of the proposed restructuring as described in the text. This question tests understanding of the NCF-SE's key proposals.


**8.  The Global Gender Gap Index and the Gender Social Norms Index are released by different organizations. Which organization releases the Global Gender Gap Index?**

(a)  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(b)  The World Economic Forum
(c)  The World Health Organization (WHO)
(d)  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index annually.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect; these organizations release other important indices related to gender but not the Global Gender Gap Index. This question tests factual recall regarding the source of specific global indices.


**9. The Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT) is working on a significant project. What is the primary focus of this project?**

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect; while related to language and terminology, they are not the primary focus of the CSTT's current project as described in the text. This question tests understanding of the CSTT's current work.


**10.  The National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) report provided data on spousal abuse in India. Which of the following statements best reflects a finding from this report?**

(a)  Spousal abuse was less prevalent in Southern states compared to Northern states.
(b)  Karnataka reported the lowest percentage of ever-married women experiencing spousal violence.
(c)  A significant percentage of ever-married women reported experiencing spousal violence.
(d)  The report found no correlation between education levels and spousal abuse.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NFHS-5 report indicated a significant percentage of ever-married women experienced spousal violence.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect; the text suggests higher rates in certain Southern states (like Karnataka) and doesn't specify the lowest prevalence.  Option (d) is incorrect; the text doesn't exclude a correlation between education and spousal abuse. This question tests the ability to interpret data from a specific report.


These questions aim to challenge UPSC aspirants by requiring in-depth knowledge of the facts and their interrelations rather than simple recall.  They are designed to be difficult and require a good understanding of the social issues discussed.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues related to tribal welfare, marginalized communities, and persons with disabilities.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assesses various cognitive skills, including factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.


**1.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects the current status of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a)  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs.
(b)  The criteria for identifying PVTGs includes pre-industrial level technology, high literacy rates, and economic prosperity.
(c)  Odisha currently houses the largest number of recognized PVTGs.
(d)  The term "PVTGs" was first used in 1961, based on the recommendations of the U.N. Dhebar Commission.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, Odisha currently holds the distinction of having the highest number of recognized PVTGs (13). Option (a) is incorrect because it confuses the total ST population with the number of PVTGs.  Option (b) is incorrect as the criteria for PVTG identification includes pre-agricultural technology, *low* literacy rates, and economic *backwardness*. The term PVTGs replaced PTGs (Primitive Tribal Groups) in 2006, making option (d) incorrect.  Understanding the nuances between overall tribal populations and the specific categorization of PVTGs is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of India's tribal welfare policies.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct concepts.


**2. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently emphasized the need for the implementation of a specific commission's report concerning which marginalized group?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes
(b)  Scheduled Tribes
(c)  De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)
(d)  Persons with Disabilities


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The passage explicitly states that the NHRC stressed the need to implement the Idate Commission report, which focuses on the welfare and rights of De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes. This highlights the ongoing challenges faced by these communities and the importance of addressing historical injustices. Options (a), (b), and (d) represent other vulnerable groups, but the NHRC's focus in this instance was specifically on DNTs.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the specific focus of the NHRC's recommendation.


**3.  Which of the following is NOT a characteristic used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b)  High level of literacy
(c)  Economic backwardness
(d)  Declining or stagnant population


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). The passage clearly outlines the criteria for identifying PVTGs, which include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. A high level of literacy would contradict the very definition of a vulnerable group.  The other options are all accurate descriptors of PVTGs. This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify inconsistencies within the given criteria.


**4.  The Hakki Pikki Tribe, a semi-nomadic group, primarily hails from which Indian state?**

(a)  Madhya Pradesh
(b)  Chhattisgarh
(c)  Odisha
(d)  Karnataka


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d). The passage specifically mentions the Hakki Pikki Tribe as a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka.  The other options are incorrect as they are not the primary location of this specific tribal group. This question tests factual recall of specific tribal group locations.


**5.  Which Indian ministry is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of tribal communities?**

(a)  Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b)  Ministry of Rural Development
(c)  Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d)  Ministry of Home Affairs


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The passage directly states that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare. The other options are involved in social welfare, but not as the primary and designated authority for tribal issues. This question tests factual recall of the relevant government ministry.


**6. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation percentage in which sector?**

(a)  Private sector employment
(b)  Government jobs
(c)  Higher education institutions
(d)  Both (b) and (c)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d). The passage explicitly states that the RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and no less than 5% in government-aided higher educational institutions.  The act does not directly address private sector employment. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the scope of the reservation mandate.


**7.  The "SEED" scheme, aimed at the economic empowerment of a specific marginalized group, is launched by which ministry?**

(a) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
(d) Ministry of Minority Affairs


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The passage clearly states that the "Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)" is launched by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. This highlights the government's efforts to address the economic disparities faced by DNT communities. The other options are incorrect as they are not the implementing ministry for this specific scheme. This question tests factual recall of the implementing ministry for a specific welfare scheme.


**8. Which act banned the practice of manual scavenging in India?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(c) The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(d) The Right to Information Act, 2005


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). The passage explicitly mentions that the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, banned the practice of manual scavenging. The other options are related to social justice and human rights but do not specifically address the issue of manual scavenging.  The question assesses factual recall of the relevant legislation.


**9.  The Vimukta Jatis Day is celebrated on which date by the DNT communities in India?**

(a) August 9th
(b) August 31st
(c) October 2nd
(d) September 29th


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  The passage explicitly states that August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.  The other dates are associated with different events related to the provided text. This question tests factual recall of specific dates related to social justice celebrations.


**10.  Which international organization released the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report"?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). The passage clearly attributes the release of the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" to the UNHCR. The other options are involved in different areas of international development and humanitarian assistance, but not the specific report mentioned.  The question tests factual recall of the publishing organization for a specific report.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  A legal framework in India addresses sexual harassment at the workplace, mandating the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations exceeding a certain employee threshold. Which of the following accurately describes the mandate of these ICCs?**

(a) To exclusively handle complaints of physical contact or advances.
(b) To mediate monetary settlements between the aggrieved woman and the respondent.
(c) To investigate complaints and recommend actions to the employer, potentially including actions against false complaints.
(d) To solely forward all complaints directly to law enforcement authorities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The POSH Act 2013 mandates ICCs to investigate complaints of sexual harassment, encompassing a range of unwelcome acts or behavior.  While they *may* forward complaints to the police, they also conduct inquiries, reaching findings and recommending actions to the employer based on their investigation. Critically, the Act also allows ICCs to recommend action against those filing false complaints, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to redressal and accountability. Options (a), (b), and (d) represent incomplete or inaccurate aspects of the ICC’s role. Option (a) is too narrow, focusing only on one type of sexual harassment. Option (b) is incorrect because the Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a basis for conciliation. Option (d) ignores the investigative and recommendatory powers of the ICC.


**2. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced modifications to the existing surrogacy regulations in India.  Which of the following accurately reflects a key change introduced by these amendments?**

(a)  A complete ban on surrogacy involving donor gametes.
(b)  Permitted surrogacy for foreign nationals under specific circumstances.
(c)  Allowing surrogacy for single women (widows or divorcees) only with their own eggs and donor sperm.
(d)  Elimination of the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB).

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 2024 amendments to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, notably altered the rules regarding surrogacy for single women.  Previously, the use of donor gametes was largely restricted. Now, while surrogacy is still largely altruistic, single women are permitted to use their own eggs with donor sperm.  This is a significant shift, reflecting a more nuanced approach to reproductive rights. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. Option (a) contradicts the amendment allowing donor sperm for single women. Option (b) is wrong as surrogacy for foreign nationals remains banned. Option (d) is false; the NARTSB continues to function.


**3.  In the context of child labour in India, the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, introduced crucial changes. What is a key provision of this amendment?**

(a)  Legalizing child labour in certain agricultural sectors.
(b)  Permitting adolescents (14-18 years) to work in all industries.
(c)  Prohibiting the employment of children below 14 years in all employment, with additional restrictions on adolescents in hazardous occupations.
(d)  Removing all legal restrictions on child labour in the informal sector.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 2016 amendment significantly strengthened the legal framework against child labour.  It unequivocally prohibits the employment of children under 14 in all forms of work.  Further, it imposes additional restrictions on adolescents (14-18 years) preventing them from working in hazardous occupations and processes.  This demonstrates a commitment to protecting children from exploitative labour practices. Options (a), (b), and (d) are inaccurate. The amendment does not legalize child labour in any sector.  It does not permit adolescents to work in all industries.  It strengthens protections across all sectors, including the informal economy.


**4. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and its subsequent amendment in 2021, have impacted the legal framework for child adoption in India. Which of the following reflects a significant change introduced by the 2021 amendment?**

(a)  Abolition of the District Child Welfare Committee's role in adoption processes.
(b)  Granting District Magistrates the authority to issue adoption orders.
(c)  Eliminating all appeals against adoption orders issued by Child Welfare Committees.
(d)  Complete privatization of the adoption process.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  A key change introduced by the 2021 amendment to the Juvenile Justice Act was the delegation of authority to District Magistrates (DMs) to issue adoption orders.  Previously, this authority resided solely with civil courts. This amendment aimed to streamline the adoption process and make it more efficient. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. The District Child Welfare Committees retain their crucial role.  The amendment did not eliminate appeals but rather shifted the appellate jurisdiction.  The adoption process remains under governmental oversight and is not privatized.


**5.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, significantly altered the legal landscape for people with disabilities in India. Which of the following is NOT a provision of this Act?**

(a)  Recognition of 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
(b)  Mandating a minimum of 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.
(c)  Ensuring free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18.
(d)  Establishing special courts in every district for faster adjudication of cases under the Act.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act, 2016, introduced numerous positive changes, including the recognition of a wider range of disabilities, free education for eligible children, and the establishment of specialized courts. However, the Act does *not* mandate a 5% reservation in *all* government jobs; the reservation is 4% and specifically excludes police forces. Options (a), (c), and (d) accurately reflect provisions within the Act.


**6. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, aims to eradicate manual scavenging in India.  Which of the following is NOT a key provision of this Act?**

(a)  Banning the employment of manual scavengers.
(b)  Mandating the construction of insanitary latrines.
(c)  Providing for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.
(d)  Making it an offense to employ individuals to clean sewers and septic tanks without appropriate protective gear.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The 2013 Act actively works to eliminate manual scavenging. It prohibits the employment of manual scavengers and mandates actions to improve sanitation infrastructure.  Crucially, it *prohibits* the construction of insanitary latrines, not mandates it. Options (a), (c), and (d) accurately reflect the Act's provisions.  The Act aims to prevent the use of insanitary latrines, promote safe working conditions, and support the rehabilitation of those previously engaged in manual scavenging.


**7.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) proposes significant changes to the Indian school education system.  Which of the following is NOT a key feature of the NCF-SE?**

(a)  A 5+3+3+4 age-based curricular and pedagogical structure.
(b)  Promoting multilingualism, with students aiming for proficiency in at least three languages.
(c)  Introducing a rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level.
(d)  Emphasis on developing capacities for scientific inquiry in science education.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE advocates for a more holistic and flexible approach to education.  It emphasizes multilingualism, scientific inquiry, and a seamless integration of academic and vocational subjects, rather than a rigid separation. Option (c) is the opposite of the framework's intent.  The NCF-SE seeks to break down traditional barriers between subjects to create a more integrated and relevant learning experience.


**8.  The National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, established a new body to guide research and innovation in India.  What is a key function of the NRF?**

(a)  To exclusively focus on research in the humanities and social sciences.
(b)  To solely fund research projects in private sector companies.
(c)  To provide strategic direction for research and innovation across a broad range of scientific and technological fields, including social sciences.
(d)  To replace all existing research funding mechanisms in India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NRF has a broad mandate to foster research and innovation across various scientific and technological domains, explicitly including the interface between humanities and social sciences. It is not limited to a single sector or disciplinary area. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. The NRF's scope is multidisciplinary and encompasses both public and private sector engagement.  It complements, not replaces, existing research funding mechanisms.

**1.  Which statement accurately reflects the categorization of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) PVTGs are identified solely based on their pre-agricultural technology.
(b)  All Scheduled Tribes (STs) are classified as PVTGs.
(c)  The criteria for PVTG identification include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
(d) Odisha has the lowest number of PVTGs in India.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The definition of PVTGs explicitly includes multiple criteria beyond just pre-agricultural technology. While pre-agricultural technology is a factor, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and population trends are also crucial in determining PVTG status.  Not all STs are PVTGs; PVTGs represent a specific, particularly vulnerable subset within the larger ST population. Odisha, in fact, houses the highest number of PVTGs, not the lowest.


**2.  The Hakki Pikki tribe, a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka, is best described as:**

(a) Primarily engaged in agriculture.
(b) A group exclusively categorized as a Denotified Tribe (DNT).
(c) A semi-nomadic community with diverse livelihood strategies, including transport, trade, and entertainment.
(d)  A community that is not considered a nomadic tribe.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group with various occupations, not limited to a single activity.  Crucially,  while all DNTs are nomadic tribes, not all nomadic tribes are DNTs—the Hakki Pikki tribe's categorization is not solely as a DNT.


**3.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High levels of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) Declining or stagnant population


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that low literacy is a criterion for identifying PVTGs.  High literacy would indicate a level of development contradictory to the vulnerability that defines PVTGs.


**4. Which government initiative aims to improve the educational empowerment of Denotified Tribes (DNTs) who are not covered under SC/ST/OBC categories?**

(a)  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme
(b)  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(c)  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)
(d) Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship program is explicitly designed to address the educational needs of DNTs who don't fall under other reservation categories. While the SEED scheme also helps DNTs, its focus is broader than just education. The NCDNT is a commission, not a direct empowerment scheme. The Nanaji Deshmukh scheme focuses on hostel construction.


**5. According to the provided text, which state has the highest number of PVTGs in India?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Andaman and Nicobar Islands
(d) Odisha


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that Odisha has the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.


**6.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates:**

(a)  A minimum of 10% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.
(b)  Reservation for PwDs is applicable to all police forces in India.
(c)  Recognition of 15 types of disabilities.
(d) Free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities within the specified age range.  The act mandates a minimum of 4%, not 10%, reservation in government jobs, and excludes police forces.  Furthermore, the act recognizes 21, not 15, types of disabilities.


**7. Which legal instrument prohibits manual scavenging in India?**

(a) The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem
(b) The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)
(c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR)
(d) The Swachhta Udyami Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act specifically outlaws manual scavenging.  The other options are initiatives to address or mitigate the issue but do not represent the primary legal instrument prohibiting the practice.


**8. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) for school education, as mentioned in the text, primarily aims to:**

(a)  Reduce the number of subjects studied at the secondary level.
(b)  Eliminate vocational education from the curriculum.
(c) Transform the school education system through changes in curriculum and pedagogy.
(d)  Introduce a single, uniform language for all schools across India.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF's main goal is a comprehensive overhaul of the school education system, encompassing both curriculum and teaching methods. The other options misrepresent the NCF's aims.


**9.  The National Medical Commission (NMC) is:**

(a) A non-statutory body overseeing medical education and practice in India.
(b)  A body that has received WFME recognition for 5 years.
(c)  A statutory body established under the NMC Act, 2019, overseeing medical education and practice in India.
(d) Primarily responsible for regulating dental education.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NMC is a statutory body established by the NMC Act, 2019, and its mandate includes medical education and practice. The NMC's WFME recognition is for 10 years, not 5.  The National Dental Commission (NDC) is responsible for regulating dental education.


**10. Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023?**

(a) The World Bank
(b) The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(c) The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
(d) The World Health Organization (WHO)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly attributes the release of the India Ageing Report 2023 to the UNFPA in collaboration with IIPS.  The other organizations are involved in other reports or areas of work related to population and development, but not specifically this report.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and focuses on specific factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.


**1.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) mandates the establishment of which committee in organizations with 10 or more employees?**

(a)  A District Grievance Redressal Committee
(b) A National Commission for Women Investigative Panel
(c) An Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)
(d) A Local Committee for Sexual Harassment Complaints

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The POSH Act, 2013, explicitly requires organizations with 10 or more employees to form an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) to handle complaints of sexual harassment.  This committee plays a crucial role in investigating complaints, mediating between parties, and recommending appropriate action.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because while they might be involved in addressing sexual harassment complaints in certain situations, they are not the mandatory committee mandated by the POSH Act for larger organizations.  The ICC's creation is central to the Act's aim of providing a mechanism for redressal within the workplace itself, promoting a safer environment for women.  Understanding the structure and function of the ICC is key to comprehending the Act's implementation.


**2.  Which legal instrument defines a "child" as a person who has not completed 18 years of age, with a provision for trying certain children aged 16-18 as adults in cases of heinous offenses?**

(a) The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956
(b) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976
(c) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(d) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, sets the age of childhood at 18.  Crucially, it also contains a provision allowing for children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults in cases involving heinous crimes. This is a complex area with significant implications for juvenile justice.  The other Acts listed deal with specific aspects of child protection (adoption, bonded labor, sexual offenses) but don't define the broader legal framework for determining the age of a child and the conditions under which they might be treated as adults in the criminal justice system.  Understanding this specific provision in the Juvenile Justice Act is vital for analyzing India's approach to juvenile delinquency.


**3.  The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme falls under the purview of which Ministry?**

(a) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(b) Ministry of Human Resource Development
(c) Ministry of Labour and Employment
(d) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCLP is a centrally sponsored scheme administered by the Ministry of Labour and Employment.  This is a crucial point to remember as it highlights the government's approach to tackling child labor.  While other ministries are involved in child welfare, the NCLP specifically targets the rehabilitation of child laborers and falls under the labor ministry's direct responsibility. This underscores the connection between labor laws and child protection, emphasizing the importance of addressing the economic exploitation that often underlies child labor.


**4.  Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023, in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)?**

(a) The World Bank
(b) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c) The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d) The World Health Organization (WHO)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UNFPA collaborated with IIPS to produce the India Ageing Report 2023.  This highlights the UNFPA's role in demographic research and its engagement with India's specific population dynamics. The other organizations, while involved in various aspects of development and health, were not involved in this specific report.  Knowing the UNFPA's involvement underscores its focus on population trends and their implications for social and economic planning.


**5. According to the  Supreme Court judgment in *Temple of Healing v. Union of India*, which category of children in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) should be prioritized for inclusion in the adoption pool?**

(a) Children whose parents are deceased
(b) Children with disabilities
(c) Children whose parents haven't visited them for over a year or have unfit parents/guardians
(d) Children who have been abandoned for less than a year

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The *Temple of Healing v. Union of India* judgment specifically directs attention to children in CCIs whose parents have not visited them for over a year or whose parents/guardians are deemed "unfit."  This points to the court's concern about the lengthy stays of children in institutional care and the need for quicker pathways to permanent families.  The other options, while representing vulnerable children, are not the specific criteria highlighted in the judgment.  Understanding this aspect of the judgment provides insight into the legal framework for child adoption and the process of identifying suitable children for adoption.


**6. The  Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, was released by which Ministry?**

(a) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(b) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(c) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(d) Ministry of Education

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare released the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023. This correctly identifies the ministry responsible for public health initiatives related to women's health.  The other options are incorrect as they don't have the primary mandate for such policies. Understanding this allocation of responsibility highlights the government's approach to addressing menstrual hygiene as a public health concern.


**7.  The  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) recently issued guidelines for what aspect of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015?**

(a) Adoption procedures
(b) Child labor prevention
(c) Assessment of child suspects in heinous offences
(d) Rehabilitation of juvenile offenders

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCPCR's new guidelines specifically focus on the assessment of child suspects involved in heinous crimes under the Juvenile Justice Act.  This highlights the complexities of the juvenile justice system and the need for specific procedures in dealing with serious offenses committed by minors.  The other options are related to child protection but do not reflect the specific focus of the NCPCR guidelines. This demonstrates a need for specialized approaches within the broader juvenile justice framework.


**8.  Which Act seeks to repeal the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947, and establish a National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC)?**

(a) The National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019
(b) The National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023
(c) The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023
(d) The  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NNMC Act, 2023, aims to replace the outdated Indian Nursing Council Act and create a more modern and effective regulatory body for nursing and midwifery education.  This is a key reform in the healthcare sector.  The other Acts deal with different aspects of the medical and legal systems and do not address the regulation of nursing and midwifery.  Understanding this reform highlights the government's focus on improving the quality and availability of nursing professionals.


**9.  The  "three zeros" target by 2030, as outlined by the UNFPA, includes which of the following goals?**

(a) Ending extreme poverty, ending hunger, and ensuring good health and well-being
(b) Ending unmet need for family planning, ending preventable maternal death, and ending gender-based violence and harmful practices
(c) Ending child marriage, ending female infanticide, and ending gender inequality
(d) Ending illiteracy, ending unemployment, and ending social discrimination

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNFPA's "three zeros" target specifically focuses on reproductive health, maternal mortality, and gender-based violence.  These are interconnected issues that the UNFPA prioritizes in its global work. The other options, while important development goals, do not reflect the UNFPA's specific "three zeros" framework.  Understanding these goals provides insight into the UNFPA's strategic priorities and its approach to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.


**10. The  Panchsheel Principles for tribal development emphasize which of the following core tenets?**

(a)  Complete assimilation of tribal communities into mainstream society
(b)  Prioritizing economic development over cultural preservation
(c)  Respect for tribal rights to land and forests, and allowing development along their own genius
(d)  Imposing alien values to accelerate social and economic progress

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Panchsheel Principles advocate for respecting tribal rights, particularly land and forest rights, and enabling development in a way that aligns with tribal cultures and traditions.  This represents a sensitive approach to tribal welfare.  The other options are incorrect as they contradict the fundamental principles of respecting tribal autonomy and cultural identity.  Understanding these principles is crucial for analyzing policies aimed at tribal development and empowerment.


These questions are designed to be challenging and test a deep understanding of the provided text.  The explanations provide sufficient detail to justify the correct answer and clarify potential misconceptions.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test various cognitive skills.  Remember that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the individual's knowledge base.

**1.  Which of the following accurately describes an "ODF Plus Model village"?**

(a) A village that has sustained its ODF status and implemented either solid or liquid waste management.
(b) A village that has achieved ODF status and maintains visual cleanliness, but lacks comprehensive waste management systems.
(c) A village that has sustained its ODF status, has systems for both solid and liquid waste management, and demonstrates visual cleanliness and effective IEC messaging.
(d) A village that has recently achieved ODF status and is in the process of implementing waste management systems.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The definition of an "ODF Plus Model village" explicitly states the requirement of sustained ODF status, arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness (minimal litter, stagnant water, and plastic waste), and the display of ODF Plus IEC messages. Option (a) is partially correct but doesn't include all the criteria. Option (b) lacks the comprehensive waste management aspect. Option (d) describes a village in transition, not a model village.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of the ODF Plus Model criteria.


**2.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is primarily tasked with which of the following?**

(a) Providing financial assistance to individual members of DNT communities.
(b) Implementing skill development programs for DNT youth.
(c) Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
(d) Overseeing the construction of hostels for DNT children.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the NCDNT's role is to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes (DNTs).  While options (a), (b), and (d) represent actions undertaken to help DNTs, they are not the primary function of the NCDNT itself.  These are implemented through various schemes. The question tests factual recall of the NCDNT's mandate.


**3.  Which of the following statements regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) is NOT correct?**

(a) The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs.
(b) The RPwD Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
(c) The RPwD Act explicitly excludes police forces from the reservation policy for persons with disabilities.
(d) The RPwD Act provides for the establishment of special courts in each district to expedite cases.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs, not necessarily exactly 4%. The act provides for a minimum of 4% reservation, allowing for flexibility depending on the specific circumstances and number of vacancies. Options (b), (c), and (d) are all accurate reflections of the RPwD Act's provisions as stated in the text.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in statements related to the RPwD Act.


**4.  According to the provided text, which organization released the report titled "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report"?**

(a) The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b) The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c) The World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly attributes the release of the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" to the UNHCR. The other organizations mentioned in the text released different reports. This question tests factual recall of the organization associated with a specific report.


**5. Which of the following is NOT a key dimension of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as mentioned in the text?**

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c) Equity
(d) Quality


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions accessibility, affordability, and quality as key dimensions of UHC. While equity is a crucial aspect of a comprehensive healthcare system, it's not explicitly listed as a key dimension of UHC in this specific text.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the defined parameters of UHC.


**6. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for which of the following language proficiencies?**

(a) Proficiency in at least one Indian language.
(b) Proficiency in at least two Indian languages.
(c) Proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.
(d) Proficiency in English and at least one Indian language.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE explicitly promotes proficiency in at least three languages, with a minimum of two being Indian languages. This emphasizes multilingualism and the importance of Indian languages in education.  The other options don't accurately reflect this policy.  This question tests factual recall of the NCF-SE's language policy.


**7. The  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) is primarily intended for which purpose within the National Credit Framework (NCrF)?**

(a) To provide financial aid to students pursuing higher education.
(b) To digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions.
(c) To regulate the fee structure of higher education institutions.
(d) To standardize the curriculum across different educational institutions.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the ABC is designed to digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions, allowing for credit transfer and flexibility within the NCrF. The other options are not the primary functions of the ABC. This tests factual recall and understanding of the ABC's role.


**8.  Which of the following best describes the primary function of the National Research Foundation (NRF) as outlined in the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023?**

(a) To fund specific research projects in the humanities.

**Explanation:** The Act explicitly states that the NRF's core function is to provide strategic direction for research, innovation, and entrepreneurship across a wide range of scientific and technological disciplines. While the NRF may undertake activities related to options (a), (c), and (d), they are not the primary focus as detailed in the text. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the NRF's main objective.


**9.  The "Global Gender Gap Index" is released annually by which organization?**

(a) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(b) The World Bank
(c) The World Economic Forum
(d) The International Monetary Fund (IMF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index annually.  The other organizations mentioned are involved in different areas of development and research. This question tests factual recall of the organization responsible for a specific index.


**10. The  "Triple Threat Report" on the burden of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) related threats faced by children was released by which organization?**

(a) The World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) UNICEF
(c)  The World Bank
(d) WaterAid


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The text specifies that UNICEF released the "Triple Threat Report" focusing on WASH-related threats to children.  The other organizations are also involved in related work, but not specifically with this report. This question tests factual recall.


Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  Which organization, established in 1975, is a major research center within a global partnership focused on food security research and operates in over 60 countries, including India?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) fits the description perfectly.  It was established in 1975 and is a key part of the CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research), a global partnership dedicated to research for a food-secure future.  IFPRI's work spans numerous countries, including India, focusing on poverty reduction, hunger, and malnutrition through research-based policy solutions.  The other options are incorrect because they have different mandates and focuses.  WFP is concerned with food distribution and aid, UNFPA with population issues and reproductive health, and UNDESA with broader economic and social development goals. The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of international organizations involved in development work.


**2. The 2023 report by which organization highlighted a global rise in food insecurity due to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical conflicts, predicting a significant increase in undernourished individuals by 2050?**

(a)  UNHCR
(b)  GANHRI
(c)  UNPFII
(d)  IFPRI

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) released the Global Food Policy Report 2023, which directly addresses the issues mentioned in the question. The report details the increase in food insecurity due to overlapping crises, projecting a substantial rise in undernourishment by 2050 due to climate change. UNHCR deals with refugees, GANHRI with human rights institutions, and UNPFII with indigenous issues; none of these organizations' primary focus aligns with the report's subject matter.  This question assesses factual recall and the ability to link a report's findings to the relevant organization.


**3.  Which international organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, is responsible for reviewing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) globally based on the Paris Principles, and recently deferred the accreditation of India's NHRC?**

(a)  UNHCR
(b)  UNPFII
(c)  UNDESA
(d)  GANHRI

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is the correct answer.  GANHRI's mandate includes the accreditation of NHRIs based on the Paris Principles, and the question specifically mentions its recent deferral of the NHRC's accreditation.  The other organizations do not have this function.  This question tests factual recall of a specific organization's role and recent actions.


**4. Which UN body, established in 2000 by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), serves as a high-level advisory body focusing on indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights?**

(a)  UNHCR
(b)  UNDESA
(c)  UNPFII
(d)  UNCRC

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) precisely matches the description.  It's a high-level advisory body to ECOSOC, specifically addressing indigenous peoples' concerns across various sectors. UNHCR focuses on refugees, UNDESA on economic and social affairs more broadly, and UNCRC on children's rights. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the UN system's structure and mandates.


**5.  The Indian government’s recent notification of an international container transshipment port (ICTP) at Galathea Bay aims to reduce reliance on which major transshipment hubs currently handling a significant portion of India's cargo?**

(a) Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Busan
(b) Rotterdam, Hamburg, and Antwerp
(c) Colombo, Singapore, and Klang
(d) Los Angeles, Long Beach, and New York

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage directly states that Colombo, Singapore, and Klang handle over 85% of India’s currently transshipped cargo.  The new ICTP aims to lessen this dependence on foreign ports. The other options represent major ports in other regions of the world, but are not the primary hubs for India's transshipment activities. This question tests factual recall and understanding of India's logistical infrastructure.


**6. Which Indian Act, repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, had previously labeled certain communities as "born criminals," leading to their marginalization and subsequent recognition as Denotified Tribes (DNTs)?**

(a) The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
(b) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976
(c) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012
(d) The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 is the legislation that categorized certain communities as "criminal tribes," resulting in their stigmatization and marginalization.  The Habitual Offenders Act of 1952 replaced it, but the legacy of the earlier act continues to affect the DNTs. The other options are unrelated to the historical labeling of communities as "born criminals." This question assesses knowledge of historical legislation and its social impact.


**7. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for proficiency in at least how many languages, with a specified number being native to India?**

(a) One
(b) Two
(c) Three
(d) Four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE explicitly recommends proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two of them being Indian languages. This promotes multilingualism and the use of Indian languages in education.  The other options do not reflect the policy's emphasis on multilingual education. This question tests understanding of educational policy and its implications.


**8. Which government scheme, launched under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), utilizes Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) to provide comprehensive services for children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and has recently introduced a national protocol for children with disabilities?**

(a) Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(c) Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(d) PM-Kisan

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 is the umbrella scheme under which Anganwadi services operate.  It aims to improve the nutritional and health status of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. The recent introduction of a national Anganwadi protocol for children with disabilities falls under this scheme. Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on health insurance, Intensified Mission Indradhanush on immunizations, and PM-Kisan on farmer income support; none of these are directly related to Anganwadi services. This question tests knowledge of government schemes and their implementation.


**9.  Which report, released jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, tracks progress toward Universal Health Coverage (UHC), highlighting the importance of accessibility, affordability, and quality of health services?**

(a)  Global Hunger Index (GHI)
(b)  Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
(c)  Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring Report
(d)  State of World Population Report 2023

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring Report" directly addresses the progress towards UHC, emphasizing accessibility, affordability, and quality of care. The other options deal with hunger, forced displacement, and population trends, respectively. This question tests factual recall and the ability to link a report to its subject matter.


**10.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, modifies which section of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to raise the age of consent for sexual intercourse to 18 years, aligning it with the POCSO Act, 2012?**

(a) Section 304B
(b) Section 498A
(c) Section 375
(d) Section 113B

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Section 375 of the IPC defines rape, and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, amends this section to raise the age of consent.  Sections 304B and 113B relate to dowry deaths, and Section 498A to cruelty to women. This question tests knowledge of legal provisions and their amendments.

Both the Swachhta Udyami Yojana and the NAMASTE (National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem) scheme directly address the issue of manual scavenging and promote safer, mechanized sanitation practices.  The Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment, while NAMASTE aims for 100% mechanization of sanitation tasks. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they relate to different social sectors and government initiatives not directly connected to the two schemes mentioned in the question.  The focus of these schemes is on improving sanitation infrastructure and worker safety, thus making (b) the only accurate answer.  Understanding the specific aims of these schemes within the broader context of India's sanitation challenges is crucial.


**2.  Which of the following government initiatives directly aims to mitigate gender disparity in science and engineering research funding in Indian academic institutions?**

(a)  Impacting Research Innovation and Technology (IMPRINT) India.
(b)  Fund for Improvement of S&T Infrastructure (FIST) Scheme.
(c)  SERB-POWER (Promoting Opportunities for Women in Exploratory Research).
(d)  Promotion of University Research and Scientific Excellence (PURSE).

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

SERB-POWER explicitly focuses on addressing the gender imbalance in science and engineering research funding.  The other options, while contributing to the overall advancement of research and technology in India, do not have a specific mandate to target gender disparity in funding.  IMPRINT promotes collaboration, FIST provides infrastructure, and PURSE strengthens university research capacity. These are important but don't directly address the gender imbalance in funding as SERB-POWER does. The question tests the understanding of specific government initiatives and their targeted goals, requiring a nuanced understanding of the Indian R&D landscape.


**3. The Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report, released by which organization, highlighted a significant increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises?**

(a)  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).
(b)  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
(c)  The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI).
(d)  The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII).

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) is responsible for releasing the Global Trends report on forced displacement. This report specifically addresses issues related to refugees and asylum seekers, including those displaced due to conflict, persecution, and other factors, including social and climate crises. The other organizations focus on different aspects of international development and human rights but don't specifically produce this type of report.  The question assesses knowledge of international organizations and their specific areas of expertise, requiring accurate recall of the source of this particular report.


**4.  The Paris Principles, a key document guiding the work of GANHRI, primarily concern which area?**

(a)  International environmental protection standards.
(b)  Standards for the accreditation of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs).
(c)  Guidelines for promoting gender equality and women's empowerment.
(d)  Regulations for the ethical conduct of scientific research.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Paris Principles are specifically designed to establish standards for the functioning and accreditation of National Human Rights Institutions.  These principles outline criteria for independence, mandate, and effectiveness of such institutions.  While the other options touch upon important international concerns, they are not the primary focus of the Paris Principles.  The question tests knowledge of international human rights standards and the role of specific guidelines in shaping the work of international organizations.


**5.  The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011, while collecting caste data, ultimately published which specific data set?**

(a)  Comprehensive caste-based demographic data for all Indian castes.
(b)  Socio-economic data, excluding caste-specific details.
(c)  Detailed information on the prevalence of manual scavenging across India.
(d)  Data focusing on the educational attainment of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The SECC, 2011, while collecting caste data, ultimately published only socio-economic data, excluding the caste-specific information.  The decision to exclude caste data in the final publication is a significant point to remember.  Options (a), (c), and (d) represent data points that were collected, but not ultimately released as part of the published SECC report.  The question tests knowledge of specific government data collection initiatives and their outcomes, demonstrating an understanding of the complexities surrounding caste data in India.


**6. Which of the following is NOT a key dimension of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as generally defined?**

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c) Availability of Specialized Medical Equipment
(d) Quality

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the availability of specialized medical equipment is important for providing comprehensive healthcare, it's not considered a core *dimension* of UHC. The fundamental dimensions are accessibility (ensuring all people can reach services), affordability (avoiding financial hardship), and quality (providing effective and safe services). The question tests the understanding of the core concepts behind UHC, requiring a precise understanding of the defining characteristics.  The inclusion of a plausible but ultimately incorrect distractor (c) enhances the difficulty.


**7.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) proposes a shift from the existing four-stage schooling structure to which new structure?**

(a)  A six-stage structure based on cognitive development milestones.
(b)  A three-stage structure focusing on foundational, intermediate, and advanced learning.
(c)  A five-stage structure based on age groups: Foundational, Preparatory, Middle, Secondary and Higher Secondary.
(d)  A 5+3+3+4 structure based on age groups.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE proposes a fundamental restructuring of the school education system, moving from the existing four-stage model to a 5+3+3+4 structure.  This new framework divides schooling into different age-based stages, aiming to improve learning outcomes and cater to the developmental needs of students at different ages. Options (a), (b), and (c) represent alternative, hypothetical structures, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the NCF-SE's proposed changes.  This question tests recall and understanding of specific policy documents and their recommendations.


**8. Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023, collaborating with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)?**

(a)  The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA).
(b)  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
(c)  The World Food Programme (WFP).
(d)  The World Health Organization (WHO).

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) collaborated with the IIPS to release the India Ageing Report 2023.  This report focuses on demographic trends related to India's aging population.  The other organizations, while involved in various aspects of international development, did not release this specific report. The question tests knowledge of specific international reports and the organizations responsible for their publication.  The correct answer requires precise knowledge of the involved organizations.


**9.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, broadened the definition of "domestic violence" to include which of the following?**

(a) Only physical and sexual abuse within the marital home.
(b)  Physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and/or sexual abuse within a shared household.
(c)  Only financial exploitation and emotional manipulation by a spouse.
(d)  Solely incidents of physical assault occurring outside the marital home.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, significantly expanded the definition of domestic violence to encompass a wide range of abusive behaviors, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse.  This comprehensive definition aims to address the multifaceted nature of domestic violence and provide legal recourse for victims experiencing various forms of abuse. The other options present limited and inaccurate interpretations of the act's scope.  The question assesses understanding of legal frameworks related to gender-based violence and the evolution of legal definitions.


**10. The Boeing Sukanya Program is primarily focused on which of the following?**

(a) Promoting women's participation in politics and governance.
(b)  Enhancing access to healthcare services for girls and women in rural areas.
(c)  Supporting girls' entry into the aviation sector through STEM education and training.
(d)  Addressing the issue of child marriage and promoting girls' education in general.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Boeing Sukanya Program specifically targets the underrepresentation of women in the aviation sector by providing opportunities for girls and women to pursue STEM education and training in aviation-related fields.  While the other options relate to important social issues, they are not the direct focus of the Boeing Sukanya Program. The question tests knowledge of specific initiatives aimed at promoting women in STEM fields, requiring accurate recall of program goals.


**1.  Which initiative aims to holistically address health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, encompassing interventions across various healthcare domains?**

(a) Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(b) Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)
(c) National Health Policy 2017
(d) Ayushman Bharat Yojana

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a comprehensive health insurance scheme designed to provide financial protection and access to quality healthcare services to all citizens.  It aims to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by addressing health needs at all three levels—primary, secondary, and tertiary.  This involves interventions in disease prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation, thereby covering the full spectrum of healthcare services.  In contrast, the Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses specifically on immunization; ABDM concentrates on digital health infrastructure; and the National Health Policy 2017 sets the overall policy framework for achieving UHC but doesn't directly deliver services in the same holistic manner as Ayushman Bharat Yojana.  The latter's wide-ranging approach makes it the most suitable answer.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana's emphasis on a tiered healthcare system, incorporating preventive, curative, and rehabilitative aspects, sets it apart from the other options which focus on specific components of healthcare delivery.


**2.  Which scheme, launched under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, uses a three-step approach (screening for disabilities, community inclusion, and referral support) to aid children with disabilities?**

(a) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(b) National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan
(c) National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children
(d) Integrated Child Development Service (ICDS) scheme

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children is a targeted initiative explicitly designed to address the needs of children with disabilities.  Its three-step approach – screening, inclusion, and referral – directly targets the challenges faced by this vulnerable group. While Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, the National Nutrition Mission, and the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme all contribute to the overall well-being of children, they lack the specific focus on disability inclusion that defines the National Anganwadi Protocol.  The protocol's unique features, such as its emphasis on early detection, community participation, and streamlined referral systems, make it the correct answer.  It represents a specific, targeted policy intervention, unlike the broader programs mentioned in other options.


**3.  What is the primary goal of the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY)?**

(a) Providing financial assistance to farmer families.
(b) Offering insurance coverage to Anganwadi workers and helpers.
(c) Providing loans to non-corporate and micro-enterprises.
(d) Reducing stunting in districts with high malnutrition burdens.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) is a life insurance scheme specifically designed to provide affordable life insurance coverage to a large section of the Indian population.  The scheme explicitly covers Anganwadi workers and helpers, alongside other eligible individuals.  The other options refer to different government schemes: PM-Kisan for farmer assistance, PMMY for micro-enterprise loans, and POSHAN Abhiyan for malnutrition reduction.  These schemes serve distinct purposes and do not directly relate to the life insurance coverage provided by PMJJBY. The focus on providing social security benefits to Anganwadi workers and helpers distinguishes PMJJBY from other social welfare programs.


**4.  Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023, collaborating with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)?**

(a) UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b) UN Committee on Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(c) World Food Programme (WFP)
(d) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is the UN agency specifically focused on population issues, including aging demographics.  The India Ageing Report 2023 aligns directly with UNFPA's mandate and expertise.  The other options represent organizations with different areas of focus: UNDESA deals with broader economic and social development goals; UNCRC focuses on children's rights; and WFP addresses food security.  The specific collaboration with IIPS and the report's subject matter clearly point to UNFPA as the correct answer.  The UNFPA's established role in demographic research and its direct involvement in the report make it the only accurate option.


**5. Which report examined the "triple burden" of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)-related threats faced by children, focusing on access to basic services, mortality rates linked to unsafe WASH, and climate-related risks?**

(a) ‘Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)’
(b) Global Food Policy Report 2023
(c) ‘Triple Threat Report’
(d) Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Triple Threat Report" explicitly addresses the combined challenges of WASH-related threats for children, encompassing access to services, mortality, and climate vulnerability. While the WHO report on WASH-related diseases examines health impacts, it doesn't cover the broader "triple burden" framework. The Global Food Policy Report focuses on food security, and the UNHCR report addresses displacement. Only the "Triple Threat Report" directly aligns with the described criteria by combining WASH issues, child mortality, and climate risks in a single assessment.  The specific terminology of "triple threat" and the detailed description of the report's contents make (c) the only suitable answer.


**6. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 was released by which two non-governmental organizations?**

(a) World Economic Forum and UNDP
(b) World Bank and WHO
(c) Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
(d) UNICEF and UN Women

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 is a joint publication of Concern Worldwide (an Irish NGO) and Welt Hunger Hilfe (a German NGO). These organizations specialize in combating hunger and poverty globally.  The other options list different organizations with different primary areas of focus.  The World Economic Forum and UNDP focus on development and economic issues; the World Bank and WHO on global health and finance; and UNICEF and UN Women on children's rights and gender equality.  The specific authorship of the GHI report clearly identifies Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe as the correct answer. The long-standing collaboration between these two NGOs in producing the GHI report makes it the only accurate response.



**7.  Which act aims to regulate and supervise Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) clinics and banks, preventing misuse and ensuring safe and ethical practices, while also encompassing surrogacy?**

(a) Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
(b) Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021
(c) Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(d) Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, specifically addresses the regulation of ART services, including surrogacy.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, while related, focuses solely on the regulation of surrogacy itself. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act and the Juvenile Justice Act deal with entirely different social issues. The ART Act's comprehensive scope, encompassing various aspects of ART and its explicit inclusion of surrogacy regulations, makes it the correct answer.  The Act's broad regulatory framework differentiates it from other legislation focused on specific aspects of reproductive or child welfare.


**8.  Which scheme aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and reduce mortality and malnutrition rates?**

(a) Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(c) Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(d) Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 is a comprehensive scheme directly focused on improving the nutritional and health status of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Its objectives explicitly include reducing mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition. While Ayushman Bharat Yojana provides health insurance, it doesn't specifically target this demographic group with the same nutritional focus.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush concentrates on immunization, and the Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana offers micro-loans.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0's direct and explicit focus on the stated goals makes it the correct answer.  The scheme's integrated approach to nutrition and healthcare for vulnerable groups distinguishes it from other initiatives.


**9. Which government body oversees medical education and practice in India, and recently received WFME recognition for its accrediting agencies?**

(a) National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
(b) National Medical Commission (NMC)
(c) National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC)
(d) National Dental Commission (NDC)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Medical Commission (NMC) is the statutory body responsible for regulating medical education and practice in India.  Its recent WFME (World Federation for Medical Education) recognition highlights the improvements in the quality and standardization of medical education in the country.  The other options relate to educational and regulatory bodies in different sectors, but not medical education. The NMC's central role in overseeing medical education and its achievement of WFME recognition clearly distinguish it as the correct answer.  The specific reference to WFME accreditation makes (b) the unambiguous choice.


**10.  Which report highlighted that progress on more than 50% of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets is weak, with 30% stagnating or reversing?**

(a) Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
(b) Global Food Policy Report 2023
(c) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition
(d) India Ageing Report 2023

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition explicitly assesses the progress made toward achieving the SDGs, highlighting the significant shortcomings in achieving numerous targets.  The other reports focus on specific issues such as forced displacement, food security, and India's aging population, without the comprehensive SDG assessment.  The SDG Progress Report's direct assessment of SDG progress and the specific data points mentioned in the question make it the only appropriate answer. The report's comprehensive evaluation of SDG achievements and its identification of areas of concern make it the correct answer.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question focuses on specific details and requires a nuanced understanding of the subject matter.


**1.  The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed as Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, is a crucial component of which larger national program aimed at improving the well-being of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers?**

(a)  National Rural Health Mission
(b)  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme
(c)  National Health Policy 2017
(d)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.  The passage explicitly states that the Anganwadi system is an integral part of the ICDS scheme.  While other options relate to health and well-being initiatives in India, they don't directly encompass the Anganwadi program as a core component. The National Rural Health Mission focuses on broader rural health infrastructure, the National Health Policy 2017 sets overall health goals, and Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a health insurance scheme.  These are distinct initiatives, although they may intersect with or support the goals of ICDS.  The ICDS scheme is specifically designed to provide a comprehensive package of services for children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, making the Anganwadi system a vital part of its structure and implementation.


**2.  Which international organization released a report in 2023 titled "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report," highlighting the significant increase in forced displacement worldwide due to conflict, persecution, and other factors?**

(a)  International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(d)  World Food Programme (WFP)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The passage explicitly mentions that UNHCR released the report "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report."  While the other organizations (IOM, UNDP, and WFP) also address issues related to migration, displacement, and humanitarian crises, the specific report mentioned is directly attributed to UNHCR.  UNHCR's mandate specifically focuses on protecting refugees and assisting displaced populations, making it the most logical source for such a report.  The report's title and subject matter directly align with UNHCR's core functions and areas of expertise.


**3.  The "triple burden" of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)-related threats, as defined by UNICEF's "Triple Threat Report," includes which of the following?**

(a)  High rates of waterborne diseases, inadequate sanitation infrastructure, and lack of access to clean water.
(b)  Less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation services, a high burden of WASH-attributable deaths among children under 5, and high risk of climate and environmental hazards.
(c)  Insufficient funding for WASH programs, weak governance structures, and lack of community participation.
(d)  High levels of water pollution, inadequate wastewater treatment, and lack of hygiene education.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) accurately reflects the definition of the "triple burden" provided in the text.  The passage clearly outlines the three components: less than 50% access to basic services, high child mortality due to unsafe WASH, and high risk from climate hazards.  Options (a), (c), and (d) present related challenges within the WASH sector but do not correspond precisely to UNICEF's specified "triple burden" framework.  The "triple threat" concept is a specific framework used by UNICEF for assessing the combined risks faced by children, and option (b) correctly captures the three elements of this framework. The other options are plausible but do not represent the precise definition given in the provided text.


**4.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI), released annually by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, uses which of the following indicators to assess the severity of hunger in a country?**

(a)  Food production levels, agricultural productivity, and food prices.
(b)  Prevalence of undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
(c)  Access to food assistance programs, food security policies, and government spending on nutrition.
(d)  Levels of poverty, income inequality, and access to healthcare.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b), as the text explicitly lists the four indicators used in the GHI: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality. While the other options (a, c, and d) are factors that influence hunger, they are not the specific indicators used in the GHI calculation. The GHI focuses directly on the nutritional status and mortality rates of children, providing a focused measure of hunger's impact.  The other options, while relevant to overall food security, represent broader socioeconomic factors rather than the specific composite indicators used to calculate the GHI score.


**5.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) in India aims to achieve which of the following primary goals?**

(a)  To standardize the curriculum across all levels of education.
(b)  To improve the quality of teaching and learning in higher education institutions.
(c)  To establish a seamless credit transfer system across school, higher, and vocational education.
(d)  To increase the number of students enrolling in higher education.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately describes the core objective of the NCrF. The passage explains that the framework aims to create a system for integrating credits earned across different educational pathways.  While options (a), (b), and (d) are related to education reform, they are not the central focus of the NCrF. The framework is specifically designed to improve the flexibility and mobility of learners by enabling the transfer of credits earned from various educational programs, making it a key component of India's education reforms. The other options, while relevant aspects of the broader education landscape, are not the primary goal of the NCrF.


**6.  Which government ministry is the nodal authority for the implementation of the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme in India?**

(a)  Ministry of Women and Child Development
(b)  Ministry of Human Resource Development
(c)  Ministry of Labour and Employment
(d)  Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the NCLP scheme falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment.  The other ministries deal with related social issues, but the NCLP's direct implementation rests with the Ministry of Labour and Employment.  This ministry is responsible for labor laws and policies, making it the appropriate authority for overseeing a program designed to address child labor issues. The other options, while involved in related social welfare programs, do not have the primary responsibility for implementing the NCLP.


**7.  The "three zeros" that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) aims to achieve by 2030 include which of the following?**

(a)  Zero poverty, zero hunger, and zero inequality.
(b)  Zero maternal mortality, zero unmet need for family planning, and zero gender-based violence.
(c)  Zero population growth, zero migration, and zero urbanization.
(d)  Zero child marriage, zero child labor, and zero illiteracy.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states UNFPA's "three zeros" goal as the elimination of preventable maternal deaths, unmet needs for family planning, and gender-based violence and harmful practices.  The other options represent broader development goals but are not the specific targets set by UNFPA.  UNFPA's mandate focuses on sexual and reproductive health and rights, making the elimination of maternal mortality, unmet family planning needs, and gender-based violence its primary objectives.  The other options are important development goals, but they are not directly linked to UNFPA's core mandate.


**8. The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011, in relation to the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri-Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY), was primarily used for what purpose?**

(a)  To assess the overall health status of the population.
(b)  To determine the eligibility criteria for households to access health insurance under AB PM-JAY.
(c)  To collect data on the prevalence of various diseases in India.
(d)  To evaluate the effectiveness of existing healthcare programs.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the SECC 2011 data was used to determine household inclusion in the AB PM-JAY based on deprivation and occupational criteria. While the SECC collects broader socioeconomic data, its role in AB PM-JAY was specifically for eligibility determination.  The other options represent different data collection or evaluation purposes, which are not the primary function of the SECC data in the context of AB PM-JAY.  The SECC data provided a crucial basis for targeting the AB PM-JAY towards the most vulnerable and needy populations.


**9.  The Rajya Vishisht Yojana, launched by the Haryana government, focuses primarily on which of the following?**

(a)  Promoting sustainable agriculture practices.
(b)  Providing financial assistance to farmers for managing crop residue and reducing stubble burning.
(c)  Improving irrigation infrastructure in the state.
(d)  Enhancing the productivity of dairy farming.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that the Rajya Vishisht Yojana provides financial support to farmers for managing crop residue, specifically aiming to reduce stubble burning incidents.  While the scheme may indirectly support sustainable agriculture (a), it directly addresses the problem of stubble burning through financial incentives and targets for Panchayats. Options (c) and (d) are unrelated to the scheme's objectives. The core focus is on providing direct financial assistance to farmers to change their crop residue management practices and thereby reduce environmental pollution.


**10.  The "Poshan Tracker" mobile application is primarily used by whom to monitor and track nutritional service delivery within the Anganwadi system?**

(a)  Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs)
(b)  Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs)
(c)  Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs)
(d)  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the "Poshan Tracker" is a job-aid for Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) to efficiently deliver services and reflect their efforts.  While other community health workers may be involved in related activities, the Poshan Tracker is specifically designed as a tool for AWWs within the Anganwadi system.  The other options represent different community health workers who play important roles in health and nutrition programs, but the Poshan Tracker is specifically targeted towards the AWWs in the context of the Anganwadi system.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a detailed understanding of the subject matter.  Remember, the questions are framed to assess your knowledge, not your ability to recall specific phrasing from the provided text.

**1.  Which governmental body is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its subsequent amendments, including the monitoring of State-level boards?**

(a) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(b) National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB)
(c) Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)
(d) Supreme Court of India

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, established the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) as the primary body for overseeing the implementation of the Act.  Its responsibilities explicitly include reviewing and monitoring the Act's implementation and supervising the functioning of State-level ART and surrogacy boards (SARTSBs).  While the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare plays a role in the policy framework and IRDAI is involved in insurance regulations related to surrogacy, the NARTSB holds the central authority for regulatory oversight as per the Act. The Supreme Court's role is limited to judicial review of the Act and related cases.


**2. A significant Supreme Court case concerning surrogacy, allowing a woman with a specific reproductive disorder to utilize donor gametes, highlighted the complexities of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021. What reproductive disorder was the subject of this landmark case?**

(a) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
(b) Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome
(c) Endometriosis
(d) Tubal factor infertility

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court case *Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India* specifically addressed the case of a woman with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.  MRKH syndrome is a rare congenital disorder that affects the female reproductive system, resulting in uterine agenesis (absence of a uterus) and often other reproductive abnormalities. This case brought to light the limitations of the initial regulations on donor gametes in surrogacy and prompted amendments to allow for such cases under specific circumstances. The other options represent other reproductive disorders, but they were not the subject of this particular landmark case.


**3.  The 2021 amendment to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act significantly altered the legal landscape surrounding abortion in India.  Which of the following is NOT a change introduced by this amendment?**

(a) Extension of the gestational limit for abortion under certain conditions.
(b) Introduction of stricter regulations on the types of medical professionals who can perform abortions.
(c) Increased accessibility for women seeking abortion services.
(d) Allowing termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks under certain conditions for all women.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The 2021 amendment to the MTP Act aimed to increase access to safe and legal abortion services for women.  The amendment extended the gestational limit for abortion under specific circumstances, such as rape or incest, and broadened the categories of women who could access abortion services.  The amendment did *not*, however, introduce stricter regulations on the types of medical professionals who can perform abortions; rather, it aimed to streamline the process and make it more accessible.  Option (d) is partially correct, but the amendment also extended the limit beyond 20 weeks in specific circumstances.


**4. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for a significant restructuring of the school education system in India.  Which of the following BEST describes the proposed new structure?**

(a) 4+4+4 system: 4 years primary, 4 years upper primary, 4 years secondary.
(b) 5+3+3+4 system: 5 years foundational, 3 years preparatory, 3 years middle, 4 years secondary.
(c) 6+3+3 system: 6 years primary, 3 years middle, 3 years secondary.
(d) 10+2 system: 10 years of secondary school followed by 2 years of higher secondary education.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE, aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for school education. This framework divides schooling into four stages based on age groups: Foundational Stage (ages 3-8), Preparatory Stage (ages 8-11), Middle Stage (ages 11-14), and Secondary Stage (ages 14-18).  This structure emphasizes foundational learning in the early years and allows for greater flexibility and choice in later stages. The other options represent different and outdated educational structures.


**5.  Which of the following is NOT a key recommendation of the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee regarding the accreditation of higher education institutions in India?**

(a) Implementation of a composite assessment system (CAS)
(b) Transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited)
(c) Retention of the existing 8-point grading system used by NAAC
(d) Introduction of maturity-based graded accreditation

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee proposed significant reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in India.  Key recommendations included a shift away from the existing 8-point grading system of NAAC to a simpler binary system (Accredited/Not Accredited) with sub-categories for institutions awaiting accreditation.  The committee also advocated for a composite assessment system (CAS) and a maturity-based graded accreditation to encourage continuous improvement among accredited institutions.  The retention of the 8-point grading system was explicitly rejected in favor of a more streamlined approach.


**6. The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was developed by which organization?**

(a) NITI Aayog
(b) Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)
(c) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(d) World Bank

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs was developed by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI).  MoSPI is the nodal ministry responsible for collecting and disseminating national-level statistics in India, making it the appropriate body to develop a framework for tracking progress towards the SDGs. While NITI Aayog plays a role in policy formulation and the UNDP and World Bank contribute to global SDG monitoring, the NIF itself was a product of MoSPI.


**7.  Which government scheme aims to provide free competitive exam coaching to students from Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and offers health insurance to their families?**

(a)  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship
(b)  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme
(c)  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(d)  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is specifically designed to provide comprehensive support to DNTs, including free competitive exam coaching for students and health insurance for families.  While other schemes mentioned focus on education or welfare, SEED directly addresses the economic empowerment of DNTs through targeted interventions.


**8. Which Act in India prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in any occupation and also regulates the employment of adolescents in hazardous occupations?**

(a) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(b) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(c) The Right to Education Act, 2009
(d) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, specifically addresses the prohibition of child labour below the age of 14 and regulates the employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations. While other acts address related issues such as juvenile justice, education, or protection from sexual offences, only this Act directly tackles the issue of child labour prohibition and regulation in hazardous occupations.


**9.  The “triple threat” of WASH-related challenges faced by children, as outlined in a UNICEF report, encompasses which three key elements?**

(a) Lack of access to clean water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices.
(b) High rates of child mortality, malnutrition, and infectious diseases.
(c) Limited access to basic water or sanitation, high burden of WASH-attributable deaths, and high risk of climate-related hazards.
(d) Poor water quality, insufficient sanitation facilities, and lack of access to healthcare.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The UNICEF report highlighted a "triple threat" where countries face three interconnected challenges:  (1) limited access to basic water or sanitation services; (2) a high burden of deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) among children under five; and (3) a high risk of climate and environmental hazards, as measured by UNICEF's Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI).  This combination creates a particularly vulnerable situation for children.


**10. Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023, focusing on demographic trends and their implications for the country?**

(a)  National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)
(b)  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  Population Foundation of India (PFI)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The India Ageing Report 2023 was released by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).  UNFPA is a key UN agency focused on population dynamics, reproductive health, and related issues, making it a logical source for such a report.  While other organizations mentioned work on related issues, the report's authorship is specifically attributed to UNFPA in collaboration with IIPS.


**1.  Which entity releases an annual index evaluating four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment, with India's 2023 ranking being 127 out of 146 countries?**

(a) United Nations Development Programme
(b) World Bank
(c) World Economic Forum
(d)  International Monetary Fund

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The World Economic Forum (WEF) is the organization responsible for releasing the Global Gender Gap Index annually.  This index assesses gender equality across four key dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment.  The provided information explicitly states that India ranked 127th out of 146 countries in 2023 according to this index. The UNDP, World Bank, and IMF are all significant international organizations, but they are not associated with the Global Gender Gap Index.  The UNDP releases the Gender Social Norms Index, which focuses on understanding systematic disadvantages faced by women, using a different set of dimensions. The World Bank, in collaboration with the WHO, releases the UHC Service Coverage Index. The IMF focuses primarily on economic issues and does not release indices directly related to gender equality or social development in the same way as the WEF.


**2. Which index, jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP, introduces twin indices to measure women's empowerment and gender equality globally, one focusing solely on women's power and freedoms and the other evaluating women's status relative to men?**

(a) Global Gender Gap Index
(b) Gender Social Norms Index
(c) UHC Service Coverage Index
(d) Path to Equal Report

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Path to Equal Report, a joint initiative of UN Women and UNDP, is specifically designed to measure the status of women's empowerment and gender equality worldwide using two distinct indices. The Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) focuses exclusively on women's capabilities, freedoms, and opportunities.  The Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI), on the other hand, compares the status of women to that of men across key dimensions of human development, highlighting disparities between the genders. The other options represent different indices with different scopes and methodologies. The Global Gender Gap Index, produced by the World Economic Forum, focuses on gender equality across broader societal parameters. The Gender Social Norms Index, produced by the UNDP, analyzes social norms impacting women. The UHC Service Coverage Index tracks progress toward universal health coverage based on health service indicators.


**3. Which organization released a report titled 'Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report,' highlighting a 21% increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises compared to 2021, with children comprising 30% of the forcibly displaced population?**

(a) International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c) World Health Organization (WHO)
(d)  International Labour Organization (ILO)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is responsible for the release of the report titled 'Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report'. This report details global trends in forced displacement, including the significant increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises. The provided data on the percentage of children among the forcibly displaced directly aligns with the UNHCR's report. While the IOM, WHO, and ILO deal with migration, health, and labor issues respectively, they are not the source of this specific report.  The IOM focuses on international migration; the WHO on global health; and the ILO on labor standards and conditions.  Their reports would not typically focus on the specific data presented, which is clearly within the UNHCR's mandate.


**4. Which organization, established in 1993, initially known as the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions, is responsible for reviewing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Paris Principles?**

(a) Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
(b) Amnesty International
(c) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d) Human Rights Watch

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is the correct answer.  It was established in 1993 as the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions and later renamed. GANHRI's core function is the review and accreditation of NHRIs based on the Paris Principles, which set international standards for such institutions. The OHCHR is a UN agency that plays a vital role in promoting and protecting human rights globally, but it does not directly accredit NHRIs. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are prominent NGOs working on human rights issues; however, neither performs the accreditation function of GANHRI.


**5. Which  Ministry launched a national protocol for children with disabilities, aiming to improve early identification, community inclusion, and referral support through existing healthcare networks?**

(a) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(d) Ministry of Education

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) is responsible for launching the national Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children. This protocol focuses on a three-step approach to support children with disabilities: early screening for disability signs, inclusion in community events, and referral support via ASHA/ANM and RBSK teams.  While other ministries play crucial roles in supporting people with disabilities, the MoWCD's initiative is specifically targeted at integrating disability support within the Anganwadi system, which falls directly under its purview.


**6.  Which report, released jointly by the WHO and the World Bank, addresses the global issue of ensuring access to quality health services for all without causing financial hardship, encompassing the full range of essential health services?**

(a) Global Nutrition Report
(b) Global Burden of Disease Report
(c) Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring report
(d) World Health Statistics

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 'Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring report', jointly released by the WHO and the World Bank, directly addresses the concept of Universal Health Coverage (UHC).  The report's core focus is on ensuring that all people have access to quality health services without facing financial hardship.  This aligns precisely with the definition of UHC.  The other reports deal with specific aspects of global health, such as nutrition, disease burden, or overall health statistics, but don't comprehensively address the overarching goal of UHC as defined in the question.


**7. Which organization, established in 2000 by a resolution of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), serves as a high-level advisory body to the ECOSOC and addresses indigenous issues relating to economic and social development, culture, the environment, education, health, and human rights?**

(a) UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(b) Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(c) Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples
(d) International Labour Organization (ILO)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is the correct answer.  It was established in 2000 by a resolution of the UN ECOSOC and serves as a high-level advisory body to the Council. The UNPFII's mandate specifically includes addressing indigenous issues across a wide range of areas, including economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights, as stated in the question. While the other options deal with indigenous peoples' rights, they do not have the same broad mandate and advisory role to the ECOSOC as the UNPFII.


**8. Which government body, established under the NMC Act, 2019, oversees medical education and practice in India and recently received WFME recognition for ten years, impacting the accreditation status of existing and new medical colleges?**

(a) Medical Council of India (MCI)
(b) National Medical Commission (NMC)
(c) National Board of Examinations (NBE)
(d)  Indian Medical Association (IMA)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Medical Commission (NMC) is the correct answer.  Established under the NMC Act, 2019, it is the regulatory body for medical education and practice in India.  The information about the WFME recognition for ten years directly relates to the NMC's recent achievement. The MCI was the predecessor to the NMC and no longer exists. The NBE conducts examinations, and the IMA is a professional body for doctors; neither has the overarching regulatory power of the NMC.


**9. Which committee, chaired by Dr. K. Radhakrishnan, proposed reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions in India, recommending a transition to a binary accreditation system and a maturity-based graded accreditation system?**

(a)  National Education Policy (NEP) Committee
(b)  UGC Committee on Accreditation
(c) Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee
(d)  National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET) Committee

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee is explicitly mentioned as the source of the proposed reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions in India. The committee's recommendations, including the transition to a binary system and a maturity-based graded system, are directly attributed to its report. The other options are related to education policy or accreditation but are not the specific committee that made these recommendations.


**10. Which framework, developed by a high-level committee involving UGC, AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, and various ministries, aims to integrate credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, enabling flexibility and mobility across educational pathways?**

(a) National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(b) National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(c) National Curriculum Framework (NCF)
(d) National Credit Framework (NCrF)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is the correct answer.  It is explicitly described as a framework designed to integrate credits earned across different educational pathways – school, higher education, and vocational training. The goal is to increase flexibility and mobility for students transitioning between these different levels and types of education. The other options represent individual qualification frameworks related to specific sectors of education, not the overarching integrative framework described in the question.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and focuses on specific details within the text.


**1.  A recent report highlighted a significant increase in food insecurity between 2020 and 2022. Which of the following factors did NOT contribute to this rise, according to the report?**

(a) The COVID-19 pandemic
(b) Increased global trade agreements leading to surplus food production
(c) Climate change and natural disasters
(d) Civil unrest and political instability

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The report explicitly mentions the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, natural disasters, and civil unrest as factors contributing to the rise in food insecurity. Increased global trade agreements leading to surplus food production would, counterintuitively, likely *reduce* food insecurity. The other options are directly supported by the text.  Therefore, (b) is the only option that doesn't align with the report's findings.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to identify the incongruent factor among plausible distractors.


**2. The Gender Social Norms Index, released by the United Nations Development Programme, aims to understand global disadvantages faced by women. Which of the following is NOT a dimension assessed by this index?**

(a) Political empowerment
(b) Educational attainment
(c) Economic participation
(d) Religious affiliation

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Gender Social Norms Index assesses political, educational, and economic dimensions. Religious affiliation is not mentioned as a measured dimension.  The question assesses factual recall and requires precise knowledge of the index's components.  The inclusion of (a), (b), and (c) as plausible distractors increases the difficulty level.


**3.  The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI), tracks a specific Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Which SDG does it specifically track?**

(a) SDG 2: Zero Hunger
(b) SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
(c) SDG 4: Quality Education
(d) SDG 5: Gender Equality

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the UHC SCI tracks SDG 3.8.1, which falls under SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being.  This is a straightforward factual recall question, but the use of the specific index name and SDG number adds a layer of difficulty. The other options are plausible distractors commonly associated with health and development.


**4. The Path to Equal Report introduced two indices to measure women's empowerment and gender equality. Which of the following correctly describes the focus of the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI)?**

(a) It evaluates the status of women relative to men.
(b) It focuses solely on women, measuring their power and freedoms.
(c) It emphasizes economic participation and opportunity for women.
(d) It measures the overall gender parity across various sectors.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly defines the WEI as focusing solely on women, measuring their power and freedoms to make choices and seize opportunities. Option (a) describes the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI), not the WEI.  Options (c) and (d) are too narrow and don't capture the broad scope of the WEI. This question tests conceptual understanding and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**5. The Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT) is working on technical terminology in several Indian languages. Which of the following languages is NOT included in this initiative?**

(a) Bodo
(b) Telugu
(c) Santhali
(d) Kashmiri

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**14.  The Anganwadi system is an integral part of which larger scheme?**

(a) National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM)
(b) Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY)
(c) Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
(d) Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Anganwadi system is an integral part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme. This tests knowledge of social welfare programs in India.

(b) A rigid, linear progression through educational levels
(c) Multiple entry and exit options in the education system
(d)  A credit system dividing education into eight levels

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**26.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, outlines a process for handling complaints.  Under this act, which entity is responsible for conducting inquiries into sexual harassment allegations?**

(a) Local Police
(b) The National Commission for Women (NCW)
(c) Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) or Local Complaints Committee (LCC)
(d) The employer


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Act mandates the formation of ICCs (or LCCs in their absence) to conduct inquiries. While police might get involved in certain cases, the initial investigation and inquiry are the responsibility of the ICC/LCC.  This tests understanding of legal procedures and the roles of different entities.


**27.  The  "Triple Threat Report" released by UNICEF examined the combined threat of factors related to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). Which of the following is NOT a key element of this "triple threat"?**

(a) High mortality rates among children under five due to unsafe WASH conditions.
(b) Less than 50% access to at least basic water or sanitation services.
(c) High levels of air pollution contributing to respiratory illnesses among children.
(d) High risk of climate and environmental hazards.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

(d) Alarming

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that India is categorized as "Serious" on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale.  This is a straightforward factual recall question.


**29.  According to the information provided, which state houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Jharkhand
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. This is a question that tests factual recall of specific data.


**30. The  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) was established to fulfill which primary function?**

(a) To provide financial assistance to DNT communities
(b) To prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs
(c) To implement skill development programs for DNT members
(d) To advocate for the inclusion of DNTs in government schemes

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The text explicitly states that the NCDNT was established to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs. While the other options are related to DNT welfare, the primary function of the commission is the preparation of this list.  This tests knowledge of the specific mandate of a government body.




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  Which initiative directly addresses the issue of vaccine coverage among children aged 0-5 years and pregnant women in India?**

(a) Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b) Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission
(c) National Health Policy 2017
(d) Intensified Mission Indradhanush

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Intensified Mission Indradhanush specifically targets children aged 0-5 years and pregnant women who may have missed any vaccine doses in the national immunization schedule.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on broader health interventions across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission aims to improve healthcare access through technology. The National Health Policy 2017 has a broader goal of achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC), encompassing various aspects of healthcare, not solely vaccination. Therefore, only (d) directly addresses the specified population and issue of vaccine coverage.


**2.  Which organization released a report highlighting the global burden of disease attributable to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services?**

(a) UNICEF
(b) World Bank
(c) World Health Organization (WHO)
(d) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The World Health Organization (WHO) released the report mentioned in the text focusing on the disease burden associated with unsafe WASH services. UNICEF's reports on WASH tend to focus on children's vulnerability to WASH-related threats. The World Bank often collaborates on health reports but wasn't specifically named as the primary releaser of this particular report.  IFPRI focuses on food policy and research, not directly on WASH-related health impacts. Thus, the WHO is the correct answer.


**3. The "Poshan Tracker" mobile application is primarily used by which group of frontline workers in India?**

(a) Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs)
(b) Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs)
(c) Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)
(d) Community Health Officers (CHOs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly states that the Poshan Tracker is a job-aid for Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) to efficiently deliver services and monitor their efforts. While ANMs, ASHAs, and CHOs play crucial roles in healthcare, the Poshan Tracker is specifically designed and utilized by AWWs within the Anganwadi system. The other options are plausible distractors as they're all involved in community health, but they are not the direct users of this specific application.


**4. Which of the following schemes provides financial assistance to patients suffering from rare diseases in India?**

(a) Saksham Anganwadis
(b) National Nutrition Mission (NNM)
(c) National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD)
(d) Intensified Mission Indradhanush

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD) was explicitly mentioned in the text as providing financial assistance (up to Rs 50 lakh) to patients receiving treatment at identified Centres of Excellence (CoEs).  Saksham Anganwadis focuses on strengthening Anganwadi centres. The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan aims to reduce malnutrition.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on improving vaccination coverage. Therefore, only the NPRD directly addresses financial aid for rare disease patients.


**5.  Which international legal document forms the basis of UNHCR's work with refugees and asylum seekers?**

(a) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(b) The Geneva Conventions
(c) The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol
(d) The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are the key legal documents underpinning UNHCR's work. While the other options are important human rights instruments, they don't specifically define the legal framework for refugee protection that is the core mandate of the UNHCR. The 1951 Convention, in particular, provides the legal definition of a refugee and outlines the rights and obligations of states towards them.


**6.  Which global index uses four parameters—Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment—to measure gender inequality?**

(a) Gender Social Norms Index
(b) Global Gender Gap Index
(c) UHC Service Coverage Index
(d) Women’s Empowerment Index

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), as mentioned in the text, specifically uses those four parameters to assess gender inequality across countries. The Gender Social Norms Index employs different dimensions.  The UHC Service Coverage Index focuses on health service access. The Women’s Empowerment Index concentrates solely on women's empowerment, not comparing them to men. Therefore, only the GGGI matches the described parameters.


**7.  Which organization is responsible for accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) in compliance with the Paris Principles?**

(a) United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)
(b) Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
(c) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d) Amnesty International

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions that GANHRI is responsible for reviewing and accrediting NHRIs according to the Paris Principles.  The UNHRC sets global human rights standards but doesn't directly accredit NHRIs. The OHCHR supports the UNHRC but doesn't handle the accreditation process. Amnesty International is a prominent NGO advocating for human rights but not an accrediting body in this context. Therefore, GANHRI is the correct answer.


**8.  Which Indian Act criminalizes sexual intercourse with a woman by deceitful means or making false promises?**

(a) Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005
(b) Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023
(c) Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013
(d) The Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, is explicitly mentioned as containing provisions that criminalize sexual intercourse obtained through deceit or false promises.  While the PWDVA, POSH Act, and IPC address various aspects of violence against women, they don't specifically criminalize this particular act of sexual coercion as the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita does.


**9. Which of the following is a scheme launched by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment to provide economic support to Denotified Tribes (DNTs)?**

(a) Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme
(b) Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme
(c) Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(d) Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text states that the Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) was launched by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment to provide various economic supports, including competitive exam coaching and health insurance, to DNTs. The other options, while related to social welfare, are not specifically schemes focused on the economic empowerment of DNTs.


**10. Which body released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition?**

(a) UNFPA
(b) UNPFII
(c) UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(d) UNCRC

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text directly attributes the release of the SDG Progress Report 2023: Special Edition to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA).  The UNFPA, UNPFII, and UNCRC focus on different areas of sustainable development, not this specific report.  Therefore, UNDESA is the correct answer.


**11. Which act repealed the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947 and established a new commission to regulate nursing and midwifery education?**

(a) National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019
(b) National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023
(c) National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023
(d)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the NNMC Act, 2023, was enacted to repeal the older Indian Nursing Council Act and establish the NNMC for regulating nursing and midwifery education and training.  The other options relate to medical, dental, and manual scavenging regulations, respectively, not nursing and midwifery.


**12. Which committee's recommendations were accepted by the Ministry of Education regarding reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions?**

(a) The Kasturirangan Committee
(b) The Radhakrishnan Committee
(c) The Mandal Commission
(d) The Dhebar Commission

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions that the Ministry of Education accepted the recommendations of the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee for reforms in the higher education accreditation system. The other committees dealt with different aspects of education and social policy, not higher education accreditation reform.


**1.  A global partnership established in 1971, focused on research for a food-secure future, is the core of which major research center established in 1975?**

(a)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(b)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(c)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question specifically asks about a global partnership established in 1971, focused on research for a food-secure future.  This directly describes the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). The passage clearly states that the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), established in 1975, is a major research center *of* CGIAR.  Therefore, IFPRI is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they represent different international organizations with different mandates and founding years, unrelated to CGIAR's focus on agricultural research for food security.  The question tests factual recall and requires precise understanding of the organizational relationships described in the text.


**2. Which international organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, is dedicated to protecting the rights and building a better future for people forced to flee their homes due to conflict and persecution?**

(a)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(b)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(c)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly describes the mandate and headquarters location of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  The UNHCR's core mission, as stated in the provided text, is to protect the rights and improve the lives of refugees and asylum seekers.  The other options are incorrect; IFPRI focuses on food policy research, GANHRI on human rights institutions, and UNFPA on population issues. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the specific roles of different international organizations. The precise details regarding the organization's mission and location make it a challenging question, demanding specific knowledge.


**3. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational legal documents for the work of which organization?**

(a)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(b)  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(c)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly points to the key legal documents underpinning the work of a specific organization.  The passage explicitly states that the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol form the basis of the UNHCR's work. The other organizations listed, while involved in important international affairs, do not have these specific legal frameworks as the foundation of their operations.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to connect specific legal instruments with the organization responsible for their implementation.  The specificity of the legal documents makes the question relatively difficult, demanding precise knowledge.


**4.  Which organization, headquartered in Washington, D.C., provides research-based policy solutions to reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition across more than 60 countries?**

(a)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(b)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(c)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the mandate, location, and scope of operations of a particular organization. The passage explicitly details the IFPRI's mission to address poverty, hunger, and malnutrition through research-based policy solutions, its headquarters location, and its operational reach in over 60 countries. The other options are incorrect; they represent organizations with different mandates and primary areas of focus. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the specific functions of various international organizations. The detailed description of the organization's work makes the question challenging, requiring precise knowledge.


**5. Which organization's 2022 report highlighted a 21% increase in forced displacement worldwide compared to 2021, with children comprising 30% of those displaced?**

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The question centers on a specific report and its key findings. The passage clearly attributes the report on forced displacement, including the percentage increase and the proportion of children affected, to the UNHCR's "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report." The other options are incorrect as their reports do not focus on forced displacement statistics.  This question tests the ability to link a specific report to the issuing organization and to recall key data points within that report.  The inclusion of specific numerical data increases the difficulty level of the question.


**6. The Paris Principles, adopted in 1993 by the UN General Assembly, serve as standards for which type of institution, and are reviewed by which organization?**

(a)  Indigenous rights organizations, reviewed by UNPFII.
(b)  National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), reviewed by GANHRI.
(c)  International development agencies, reviewed by UNDESA.
(d)  Family planning programs, reviewed by UNFPA.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** This question tests knowledge of international standards and the organizations responsible for their monitoring. The passage directly links the Paris Principles to the development of standards for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) and states that the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is responsible for reviewing and accrediting these institutions based on their compliance with the Paris Principles. The other options are incorrect because they involve different types of organizations and monitoring bodies. The question's difficulty lies in the need to recall both the type of institution and the specific reviewing organization.


**7.  Which UN body, established in 2000 by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), advises on indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights?**

(a)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(b)  UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(c)  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(d)  UNDESA

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question asks about a UN body with a specific mandate and establishment date. The passage clearly describes the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), its establishment by ECOSOC in 2000, and its mandate to address indigenous issues across various sectors. The other options are incorrect; they deal with different subject areas.  The question's difficulty stems from the need to recall a less widely known UN body and its specific area of focus.


**8.  The recent suspension of the Wrestling Federation of India by the Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports highlights the complexities of which aspect of Indian governance?**

(a)  Higher education policy implementation
(b)  Implementation of the National Nutrition Mission
(c)  Sports governance in India
(d)  Caste census methodologies

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on a news item and its relevance to a broader governance issue. The passage directly connects the suspension of the Wrestling Federation of India to the ongoing challenges in sports governance within India's federal structure. The other options are incorrect; they represent different areas of governance.  The question tests the ability to connect a specific news event to a larger thematic area. The context of the news item and its connection to the broader governance challenge makes the question relatively difficult.


**9.  The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011, which excluded caste data in its final publication, was a collaborative effort involving which ministries and agencies?**

(a)  Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b)  Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India
(c)  Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Ministry of Education
(d)  Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Ministry of Women and Child Development

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** This question tests knowledge of a specific census and the agencies involved. The passage explicitly details the participation of the Ministry of Rural Development, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, and the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India in the SECC, 2011. The other options are incorrect; they list ministries not directly involved in the SECC. The question's difficulty comes from the need to recall the specific agencies involved in this large-scale data collection exercise.


**10. The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, which includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs, was developed by which ministry?**

(a)  Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(b)  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(c)  Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)
(d)  Ministry of Rural Development

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the origin and development of a specific framework. The passage directly attributes the development of the NIF for SDGs to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI). The other options are incorrect; they represent ministries not primarily involved in the development of this framework.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to connect a specific policy initiative to the responsible ministry.  The less prominent role of MoSPI in the public eye compared to other ministries increases the difficulty level.


**11. Which index, released annually by the World Economic Forum, assesses gender equality across four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment?**

(a)  Gender Social Norms Index
(b)  UHC Service Coverage Index
(c)  Global Gender Gap Index
(d)  Women’s Empowerment Index

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The question focuses on a specific index and its components. The passage directly describes the Global Gender Gap Index, its annual release by the World Economic Forum, and its four key parameters. The other options are incorrect; they represent different indices with different focuses.  The question tests the ability to connect an index to its issuing organization and recall its key characteristics.  The relatively large number of indices related to gender equality makes this a challenging question, requiring specific knowledge.


**12. The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI), tracking SDG 3.8.1, is jointly released by which two organizations?**

(a)  UN Women and UNDP
(b)  World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank
(c)  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
(d)  UNFPA and IIPS

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question asks about the joint release of a specific index. The passage explicitly states that the UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) is jointly released by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.  The other options are incorrect; they represent different organizations involved in other reports or indices.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to connect an index to its responsible organizations.  The question's difficulty lies in the lesser-known nature of the UHC SCI compared to other more widely discussed global indices.


**13.  The Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT) is working on technical term dictionaries in how many Indian languages?**

(a)  5
(b)  10
(c)  15
(d)  22

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question asks about the scale of an ongoing initiative.  The passage clearly states that CSTT is working on technical term dictionaries in ten Indian languages. The other options are incorrect as they do not reflect the correct number of languages mentioned in the provided text.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to extract a specific numerical detail from the text. The question's difficulty is moderate as it requires precise recall of a numerical detail.


**14.  Which government scheme aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and is delivered through Anganwadi Centers?**

(a)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b)  Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(c)  Anganwadi Services Scheme (now Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0)
(d)  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on a government scheme and its target beneficiaries. The passage directly links the Anganwadi Services Scheme (now renamed Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0) with the stated objectives and delivery mechanism through Anganwadi Centers. The other options are incorrect; they represent different health and nutrition initiatives with different scopes and target groups. The question tests knowledge of government schemes and their specific areas of focus. The question's difficulty is moderate as it requires recall of a specific government scheme and its objectives.


**15. The "triple threat" of WASH-related challenges for children, as defined by UNICEF, includes which three factors?**

(a)  Low access to basic water or sanitation services, high burden of WASH-attributable deaths, and high risk of climate and environmental hazards.
(b)  High neonatal mortality rate, inadequate WASH services in health facilities, and lack of access to clean drinking water.
(c)  Stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence among children.
(d)  High levels of open defecation, insufficient water resources, and lack of hygiene education.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on a specific report and its key definition. The passage explicitly defines UNICEF's "triple threat" as including less than 50% access to at least basic water or sanitation services, a high burden of WASH-attributable deaths among children under 5 in the top 20 countries, and a high risk of climate and environmental hazards. The other options are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect UNICEF's specific definition of the "triple threat." The question tests understanding of a specific concept and its components.  The question’s difficulty is moderate, requiring precise recall of a specific definition from the text.


**16.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI), released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, categorizes India's hunger level as:**

(a)  Low
(b)  Moderate
(c)  Serious
(d)  Extreme

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on a specific report's assessment of a country's hunger level.  The passage states that India is categorized as "Serious" on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale. The other options are incorrect, as they do not reflect the GHI's classification of India's hunger level. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the GHI's categorization system. The question's difficulty is easy as it requires direct recall of a specific classification from the text.


**17. Which status, achieved by 75% of Indian villages by September 2023, signifies the sustained absence of open defecation and the implementation of either solid or liquid waste management systems?**

(a)  ODF
(b)  ODF Plus
(c)  ODF Plus Model
(d)  Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question centers on a specific achievement and its definition.  The passage explicitly defines ODF Plus status as meeting the criteria of sustained ODF status along with the implementation of either solid or liquid waste management systems.  The other options are incorrect; ODF is a prerequisite, ODF Plus Model adds further requirements, and Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen is the broader program under which these achievements are measured.  This question tests understanding of a specific terminology and its associated criteria.  The question's difficulty is moderate, requiring precise understanding of the different levels of achievement within the Swachh Bharat program.


**18.  The India Ageing Report 2023, released in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), was published by which organization?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the authorship of a specific report. The passage clearly states that the India Ageing Report 2023 was released by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in collaboration with IIPS. The other options are incorrect; they represent organizations that did not publish this report. This question tests factual recall and the ability to link a specific report to its publishing organization. The question's difficulty is easy as it requires direct recall of information from the text.


**19.  Which UN department, guided by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition, highlighting weak progress on over 50% of SDG targets?**

(a)  UNHCR
(b)  UNCPD
(c)  UNCRC
(d)  UNDESA

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on a specific report and its issuing department. The passage directly attributes the SDG Progress Report 2023: Special Edition and its key findings to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA).  The other options are incorrect; they represent UN bodies with different mandates.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to connect a specific report to the responsible UN department. The question's difficulty is moderate as it requires recall of a specific UN department and its role in SDG reporting.


**20.  The "three zeros" target by 2030, aiming to end unmet need for family planning, preventable maternal deaths, and gender-based violence, is a key objective of which organization?**

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(d)  World Food Programme (WFP)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on a specific set of goals and the organization responsible for them. The passage explicitly states that the "three zeros" target is a key objective of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The other options are incorrect; they represent organizations with different primary objectives.  This question tests knowledge of specific organizational goals and their alignment with broader development agendas.  The question's difficulty is moderate as it requires recall of a specific organizational target and its components.


**21. Which organization, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 for its efforts to combat hunger, operates in over 120 countries and territories, including India?**

(a)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(d)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)

**Explanation:** The question tests knowledge of an organization's achievements, operational scope, and presence in a specific country. The passage explicitly mentions the World Food Programme (WFP) receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020, its operational reach, and its presence in India. The other options are incorrect; they do not match the described characteristics.  The question's difficulty is easy as it requires direct recall of information from the text.


**22.  The  Global Food Policy Report 2023: Rethinking food crisis responses was published by which organization?**

(a)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(b)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(c)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question tests the ability to connect a specific report to its publishing organization. The passage explicitly states that the Global Food Policy Report 2023 was published by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The other options are incorrect; they are involved in other areas of international development but not this specific report.  This question tests factual recall of a specific report and its publishing organization.  The question's difficulty is easy as it requires direct recall of information from the text.

(a)  UNDESA and UNFPA
(b)  UNHCR and UNCRC
(c)  UN Women and UNDP
(d)  UNCPD and GANHRI

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question tests knowledge of a specific report and its authors. The passage clearly states that the 'Path to Equal Report', including the WEI and GGPI, was jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP.  The other options are incorrect; they involve different UN organizations not associated with this particular report.  This question tests knowledge of specific reports and their authors.  The question's difficulty is moderate, requiring recall of the specific UN organizations involved.


**24.  In the context of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, under what condition is surrogacy using donor gametes now permitted?**

(a)  When the intending couple are both over 50 years of age.
(b)  When the intending couple have no genetic connection to the child.
(c)  When the intending couple have a medical condition necessitating the use of a donor gamete, provided the child has at least one gamete from the couple.
(d)  When the surrogate mother is a close relative of the intending couple.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question tests understanding of a specific legal amendment. The passage clearly states that the amendment allows surrogacy with donor gametes if the intending couple has a medical condition requiring it, but the child must have at least one gamete from the couple. The other options are incorrect; they do not reflect the specific conditions set by the amendment.  The question tests understanding of a legal amendment and its conditions. The question's difficulty is moderate, requiring careful reading and comprehension of the legal details.


**25.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, defines domestic violence to include which types of abuse?**

(a)  Only physical and sexual abuse.
(b)  Physical, verbal, emotional, economic, or sexual abuse.
(c)  Only emotional and economic abuse.

**Explanation:** The question tests knowledge of a specific legal definition. The passage explicitly states that the PWDVA, 2005, defines domestic violence as encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, or sexual abuse. The other options are incorrect because they do not fully represent the comprehensive definition provided in the act. This question tests knowledge of a legal definition.  The question's difficulty is easy as it requires direct recall of information from the text.


**26.  Which  Act prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age and employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations?**

**Explanation:** The question tests knowledge of child labor legislation. The passage specifically mentions the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, and its provisions regarding the prohibition of child labor below 14 years and restrictions on adolescent employment in hazardous occupations. The other options are incorrect; they deal with different legal frameworks. This question tests knowledge of specific legislation.  The question's difficulty is easy as it requires direct recall of information from the text.


**27.  The Supreme Court's Temple of Healing v. Union of India judgment emphasized the need for collaborative efforts to bring which category of children into the adoption pool?**

(a)  Children with disabilities
(b)  Children from single-parent families
(c)  Children living in Childcare Institutions (CCI) whose parents haven't visited them for over a year or have "unfit" parents or guardians
(d)  Children from marginalized communities

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question tests knowledge of a specific court ruling and its implications. The passage directly links the Temple of Healing v. Union of India judgment to the need to identify and bring children in CCIs, whose parents have not visited or are deemed unfit, into the adoption pool.  The other options are incorrect; they do not fully represent the specific category of children highlighted in the judgment.  This question tests understanding of a court judgment and its focus.  The question's difficulty is moderate, requiring careful reading and comprehension of the legal details.


**28.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a child as a person who has not completed how many years of age?**

(a)  16

(d)  14

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question tests knowledge of a legal definition. The passage clearly states that the JJ Act, 2015, defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age. The other options are incorrect; they do not reflect the correct age specified in the act.  This question tests knowledge of a legal definition. The question's difficulty is easy as it requires direct recall of information from the text.

(a)  Providing healthcare to children with disabilities
(b)  Improving access to education for girls in rural areas
(c)  Liberating children from exploitation through education and rehabilitation
(d)  Promoting adoption of orphaned children

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question tests knowledge of a specific NGO and its activities. The passage directly links the Bachpan Bachao Andolan to its work in liberating children from exploitation and providing education and rehabilitation. The other options are incorrect; they do not reflect the NGO's primary focus.  This question tests knowledge of a specific NGO and its activities. The question's difficulty is easy as it requires direct recall of information from the text.


**30.  Which government portal serves as a key tool in rescuing and rehabilitating victims of child labor?**

(a)  CARINGS
(b)  ICDS-CAS
(c)  PENCiL
(d)  POSHAN Tracker

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question tests knowledge of a specific government initiative. The passage specifically mentions the PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) portal and its role in rescuing and rehabilitating child labor victims. The other options are incorrect; they represent different government platforms with other functions. This question tests knowledge of a specific government portal and its functions. The question's difficulty is moderate; it requires recall of a specific government initiative.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring a thorough understanding of the material and careful analysis of the options.


**1.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA) significantly broadened the definition of "domestic violence". Which of the following is NOT explicitly included under this Act's definition?**

(a)  Economic abuse
(b)  Psychological manipulation
(c)  Physical assault resulting in grievous bodily harm
(d)  Sexual abuse


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While psychological manipulation is a common component of domestic violence and often precedes or accompanies other forms, the PWDVA specifically defines domestic violence as acts that harm or injure or intend to injure or harm or threaten to injure or harm, whether or not such acts constitute an offence under any other law. This includes physical, verbal, emotional, economic, or sexual abuse.  The act focuses on demonstrable harm or threat of harm. Psychological manipulation, while undoubtedly damaging, isn't explicitly listed as a standalone category under the act's definition.  The act emphasizes tangible actions or threats of action that cause harm.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are all explicitly covered under the broad definition of domestic violence as outlined in the PWDVA.  The inclusion of "economic abuse" recognizes the insidious nature of financial control as a form of violence. Physical assault, resulting in either minor or grievous harm, falls squarely within the purview of the act. Sexual abuse is another explicitly mentioned form of domestic violence.


**2.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, introduced several changes to the legal framework concerning sexual offenses.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects a key modification introduced by the BNS regarding the age of consent?**

(a)  The BNS lowered the age of consent to 16 years for all sexual activity.
(b)  The BNS eliminated the marital rape exception entirely.
(c)  The BNS raised the age of consent for a married woman under the definition of rape to 18 years.
(d)  The BNS maintained the age of consent at 18 years but introduced stricter penalties for violations.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The BNS, 2023, significantly altered the legal landscape concerning sexual offenses, particularly regarding the age of consent. A crucial change involved raising the age of consent for a married woman under the definition of rape from 15 to 18 years.  This addresses a long-standing disparity in the law.  Option (a) is incorrect; the BNS did not lower the age of consent. Option (b) is also incorrect; while the BNS addressed marital rape, it did not eliminate the exception entirely. Option (d) is partially true in that penalties were adjusted, but the primary and most significant change related to the age of consent for married women.  The BNS’s modification reflects a move towards greater legal protection for women and a recognition of their right to bodily autonomy, even within marriage.



**3.  Several legislative acts in India aim to combat child trafficking. Which of the following Acts specifically addresses the exploitation of children through forced labor and bonded labor?**

(a)  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956
(b)  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012
(c)  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976
(d)  The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, directly addresses the issue of forced labor and bonded labor, aiming to liberate individuals from exploitative employment practices.  While other acts deal with aspects of child exploitation, the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, is the most pertinent. The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, focuses on sex trafficking and related offenses. The POCSO Act, 2012, specifically protects children from sexual abuse and exploitation.  The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, addresses the illegal organ trade.  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, stands out as the legislation directly designed to tackle the problem of child labor in its most exploitative forms, including bonded labor, where individuals are forced to work to repay debts, often inherited intergenerationally.


**4. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates several key provisions for the inclusion and empowerment of persons with disabilities. Which of the following is NOT a direct mandate under the RPwD Act?**

(a)  Reservation in government jobs.
(b)  Free education for children with benchmark disabilities.
(c)  Establishment of special courts for faster adjudication of cases related to disability rights.
(d)  Universal design standards for all public buildings.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act outlines various measures for the protection and empowerment of persons with disabilities, including reservation in government jobs and free education for children with benchmark disabilities.  It also establishes the framework for special courts to handle cases efficiently.  While the act promotes accessibility, it doesn't explicitly mandate universal design standards for *all* public buildings.  The act encourages accessibility but does not impose universal design as a strict legal requirement across all buildings.  The RPwD Act focuses on ensuring that existing buildings are made accessible where possible and that new constructions incorporate accessibility features in line with the act’s overall goal of inclusion.


**5.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) emphasizes several key aspects of modern education. Which of the following is LEAST emphasized in the NCF-SE's core principles?**

(a)  Development of critical thinking skills
(b)  Emphasis on rote learning and memorization
(c)  Interdisciplinary approach to learning
(d)  Incorporation of environmental education


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE advocates for a shift from rote learning towards a more holistic and student-centered approach.  Rote learning and memorization are actively discouraged in favor of critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity.  The NCF-SE strongly promotes interdisciplinary learning to connect different subjects and foster a deeper understanding.  Environmental education is also a crucial aspect, integrating ecological awareness into the curriculum.  The framework aims to cultivate well-rounded individuals equipped for the challenges of the 21st century, prioritizing critical thinking and creative problem-solving over traditional methods of rote learning.  The emphasis is on active learning, exploration, and application of knowledge.


**6.  The recent amendments to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, introduced several changes to the regulations governing surrogacy in India. Which of the following scenarios would be considered permissible under the amended rules?**

(a) Commercial surrogacy for foreign couples.
(b)  Gestational surrogacy for a single woman using donor eggs and her own sperm.
(c) Traditional surrogacy for infertile couples.
(d) Altruistic surrogacy for a same-sex couple.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The amended Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2024, maintain the ban on commercial surrogacy and restrict surrogacy primarily to altruistic gestational arrangements. While specific details vary, the amendments allow for gestational surrogacy involving donor gametes, provided at least one gamete belongs to the intending parent(s).  This means a single woman could use her own egg and donor sperm, fulfilling the requirement of at least one gamete from the intending parent.  Commercial surrogacy remains illegal. Traditional surrogacy (where the surrogate is genetically related to the child) is also prohibited. The permissibility of altruistic surrogacy for same-sex couples is not explicitly addressed in the amended rules and remains unclear.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects a scenario allowed under the amended regulations.


**7.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, presented concerning findings about global hunger levels.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects a key finding of the GHI 2023 report concerning India?**

(a) India achieved a significant reduction in its GHI score compared to 2015, indicating substantial progress in reducing hunger.
(b) India's GHI score placed it in the "low" hunger category, indicating minimal hunger challenges.
(c)  India's GHI score showed a slight improvement from 2015 but remained categorized as "serious" on the hunger severity scale.
(d)  India was ranked among the top 20 countries globally in terms of its GHI score.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2023 report highlighted that while India's GHI score showed some improvement compared to 2015, it still remained in the "serious" hunger category. The improvement was marginal and did not indicate a substantial reduction in hunger levels.  The report also highlighted concerning indicators like undernourishment, child stunting, and wasting within India.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they misrepresent the report's findings. Option (d) is also inaccurate; India was not ranked among the top 20 countries with low GHI scores but rather much lower.  The GHI 2023 report underscores the need for continued and intensified efforts to address hunger and malnutrition in India.  The report's methodology has also been subject to debate and criticism, but the key finding regarding India's ranking and category remains relevant.


**8.  The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) recently issued guidelines related to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.  What is the primary focus of these new guidelines?**

(a)  Streamlining the process of child adoption.
(b)  Improving the rehabilitation of child laborers.
(c)  Establishing procedures for assessing child suspects in heinous offenses.
(d)  Enhancing the prevention of child trafficking.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCPCR guidelines primarily address the assessment of child suspects involved in heinous offenses under the JJ Act, 2015.  These guidelines aim to provide a framework for determining whether a child aged 16-18 should be tried as an adult or juvenile. The guidelines aim to provide a structured approach to evaluating the child’s maturity, understanding, culpability, and other factors.  While the other options are important aspects of child welfare, they are not the direct focus of the NCPCR's recent guidelines. The guidelines represent a significant step in refining the legal process related to child offenders involved in serious crimes, ensuring the process is conducted in a manner that is both just and sensitive to the specific circumstances of children.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth understanding and precise factual recall.


**1.  A government initiative aims to reduce stunting in high-malnutrition districts by improving Anganwadi services.  Which program directly addresses this goal?**

(a)  National Health Policy 2017
(b)  Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(c)  National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan)
(d)  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan), launched in 2017, specifically targets the reduction of stunting and malnutrition in high-burden districts. It focuses on improving the utilization of key Anganwadi services, which are crucial for providing nutritional support to pregnant women, mothers, and children.  While the National Health Policy 2017 aims for Universal Health Coverage, and Mission Indradhanush focuses on immunization, neither directly addresses the targeted reduction of stunting through Anganwadi improvements.  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission focuses on digital health infrastructure, not direct nutritional intervention.  Therefore, POSHAN Abhiyan is the most appropriate answer.


**2. The  "triple threat"  faced by children, as defined by a UNICEF report, includes which of the following?**

(a)  High rates of child mortality due to infectious diseases, lack of access to quality education, and widespread poverty.
(b)  Insufficient access to basic water and sanitation, a high burden of WASH-related deaths, and high risk from climate and environmental hazards.
(c)  Malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, and limited access to early childhood education.
(d)  High rates of child labor, inadequate nutrition, and exposure to violence.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNICEF report highlighted a "triple threat" encompassing inadequate access to basic water and sanitation services (less than 50% access), a disproportionately high burden of deaths among children under five attributable to unsafe WASH conditions (among the top 20 countries), and a high risk of climate and environmental hazards (among the top 25% of countries in UNICEF's Children's Climate Risk Index).  Options (a), (c), and (d) present important challenges facing children, but they do not precisely reflect the specific combination of factors defined by UNICEF as the "triple threat."


**3.  Which of the following organizations released a report highlighting that progress on more than 50% of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets is weak, with progress stalled or reversed on 30%?**

(a)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) released the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023, which contained the findings on weak progress on SDG targets.  While UNFPA, WHO, and IFPRI release important reports related to development goals, this specific finding on the overall status of SDG progress is attributed to UNDESA's report.


**4.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) in India aims to integrate credits from which educational sectors?**

(a)  Higher education and vocational training only.
(b)  School education and higher education only.
(c)  School education, higher education, and vocational and skill education.
(d)  Vocational and skill education, and higher education only.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF's core objective is to create a unified framework for seamlessly integrating credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational & skill education.  This holistic approach aims to enhance flexibility and mobility among different learning pathways.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, as they omit one or more key sectors included in the NCrF's scope.


**5. The  "Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)" is a key feature of which policy?**

(a)  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)
(b)  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for Higher Education
(c)  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023
(d)  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a central component of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for Higher Education.  It's designed to digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions, allowing for greater flexibility and transferability of credits between different educational programs and institutions. The other options are unrelated to the ABC initiative.


**6. Which organization is responsible for reviewing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) in compliance with the Paris Principles?**

(a)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(b)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(c)  United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(d)  Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is the body responsible for reviewing and accrediting NHRIs according to the Paris Principles, which set international standards for such institutions. UNHCR focuses on refugees, UNCRC on children's rights, and OHCHR on broader human rights issues, but not specifically the accreditation of NHRIs based on the Paris Principles.


**7.  The  "Performance Grading Index (PGI)" in India assesses the performance of which level(s) of the school education system?**

(a)  Only the national level
(b)  Only the state level
(c)  State and district levels
(d)  Only the district level

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PGI assesses the performance of both the state and district levels of the school education system. This dual-level assessment allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the overall effectiveness of educational programs and policies across different geographical areas.


**8. Which ministry is the nodal ministry for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Home Affairs

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare and development of PVTGs.  This ministry is specifically tasked with addressing the unique challenges faced by these groups, including their socio-economic development, healthcare, and education.


**9.  The  "Swachhta Udyami Yojana" provides concessional loans for which purpose?**

(a)  Promoting entrepreneurship among marginalized communities.
(b)  Procuring sanitation-related equipment.
(c)  Providing skill development training for sanitation workers.
(d)  Building new sanitation infrastructure in rural areas.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Swachhta Udyami Yojana focuses on providing financial assistance (concessional loans) to individuals and groups for the procurement of sanitation-related equipment. This initiative aims to support the growth of sanitation-related businesses and improve sanitation services.


**10. Which act in India prohibits employment of children below the age of 14 years in all employment?**

(a) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(b) The Right to Education Act, 2009
(c) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(d) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 explicitly prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in any form of employment. While the other acts address related issues of child welfare and protection, only this specific act directly addresses the prohibition of child labor for children under 14.




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.  The explanations are detailed and aim to clarify potential points of confusion.


**1.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently advocated for the implementation of a specific report to address the needs of a marginalized group in India.  Which commission's report was this?**

(a) Renke Commission
(b) Idate Commission
(c) Dhebar Commission
(d) Mandal Commission

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the NHRC stressed the need to implement the Idate Commission report concerning De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs). The Renke Commission's work focused on nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, providing a different, though related, context. The Dhebar Commission dealt with Scheduled Tribes (STs), and the Mandal Commission focused on Other Backward Classes (OBCs).  Therefore, only the Idate Commission directly addresses the NHRC's concerns as presented in the text. The significance of this lies in the ongoing struggle for the rights and recognition of marginalized communities in India, a crucial aspect of social justice and governance.


**2.  A particular tribal group in India is recognized for its pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining population.  These characteristics define which category of tribal groups?**

(a) Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b) Other Backward Classes (OBCs)
(c) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(d) De-notified Tribes (DNTs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description precisely matches the criteria used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  SCs and OBCs are distinct categories with different defining characteristics. While some DNTs might share some characteristics with PVTGs, the definition of PVTGs explicitly emphasizes pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population, making it the most accurate answer. The question highlights the importance of understanding the nuanced classifications within India's diverse tribal population and the specific challenges faced by these vulnerable groups.


**3.  A specific piece of legislation in India aims to prevent the exploitation of individuals who historically faced discriminatory labeling as "born criminals" during the British Raj. Which Act addresses this?**

(a) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012
(b) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976
(c) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
(d) The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The passage directly links the historical categorization of DNTs as "born criminals" under the British Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. While the other Acts address important social issues, only the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, tackles the legacy of forced labor and exploitation, a problem disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities like DNTs. The POCSO Act protects children, the Surrogacy Act regulates surrogacy, and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act addresses atrocities against SCs and STs.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of historical context and its continuing impact on contemporary social issues.


**4.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates specific accessibility measures for government offices. What crucial action does this Act require of offices housed in inaccessible buildings?**

(a)  Construction of ramps and elevators.
(b)  Relocation of services to accessible locations within the same facility or to the ground floor.
(c)  Provision of sign language interpreters for all services.
(d)  Implementation of online services exclusively.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The passage clearly states that government offices in inaccessible buildings must relocate their services to accessible locations within the same facility or to the ground floor. While options (a) and (c) represent good accessibility practices, they are not the specific mandate of the Act as described. Option (d) is incorrect because it doesn't address the immediate accessibility needs of individuals with disabilities who may not have access to technology or internet facilities.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the practical implementation of disability rights legislation.


**5. A national initiative in India aims to eliminate a practice involving the manual removal of human excreta. What is this initiative targeting?**

(a)  Child labor in sanitation
(b)  Manual scavenging
(c)  Improper waste disposal in urban areas
(d)  Lack of sanitation facilities in rural areas

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly defines manual scavenging and mentions the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, which aims to eliminate this practice. While options (a), (c), and (d) are related to sanitation issues, they do not directly address the specific practice of manual scavenging. The question assesses the candidate's awareness of a significant social issue and the legislation designed to tackle it.


**6.  The Ministry of Women and Child Development launched a protocol to support children with disabilities within a specific national program. Which program is this?**

(a)  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
(b)  National Health Mission (NHM)
(c)  Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA)
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly mentions that the national Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children is implemented under the POSHAN Abhiyan, which is an integral part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.  The other options are unrelated to child welfare and disability inclusion. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the interconnectedness of government programs focusing on child welfare and disability rights.


**7.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 categorizes a specific South Asian nation as having a "serious" level of hunger.  Which country is this?**

(a) Bangladesh
(b) Pakistan
(c) Nepal
(d) India

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage directly states that India's GHI score in 2023 places it in the "serious" category. While the other countries in South Asia also face significant hunger challenges, the provided text specifically mentions India's categorization in the GHI 2023 report. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of global hunger indices and their implications for national development strategies.


**8. The UNPFII is a high-level advisory body to which UN entity?**

(a) UN General Assembly
(b) UN Security Council
(c) UN Economic and Social Council (UNECOSOC)
(d) UN Human Rights Council

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (UNECOSOC).  While it interacts with other UN bodies, its primary advisory role is to UNECOSOC.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the structure and functions of UN bodies related to indigenous issues.


**9.  A report titled "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022" was recently released by which organization?**

(a)  International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(d)  World Bank

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly indicates that the UNHCR released the report "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report". The other organizations, while involved in related areas, are not specifically mentioned as the source of this particular report. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations working on refugee and displacement issues.


**10.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, replaced which existing statutory body?**

(a)  Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)
(b)  Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)
(c)  Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
(d)  Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Anusandhan NRF Act, 2023, repealed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008, and subsumed SERB into the NRF.  The other options are independent research organizations, not directly replaced by the NRF. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the restructuring of India's research and development landscape.



Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to test various cognitive skills relevant to the UPSC exam.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  The text mentions several Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). Which of the following statements accurately reflects the categorization and distribution of these groups?**

(a) PVTGs were initially designated as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1960, based on the recommendations of the  Nehru Commission.
(b) Odisha currently houses the highest number of PVTGs, exceeding 15,  with a significant presence in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
(c) The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, and a declining or stagnant population.
(d)  The Bharia PVTG is exclusively found in Madhya Pradesh, while the Kamar and Baiga tribes are unique to Chhattisgarh.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) correctly identifies key criteria used to designate groups as PVTGs: pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  These factors reflect the vulnerability and unique challenges faced by these communities.

Option (a) is incorrect because the PVTGs were first recognized in 1973, based on the recommendations of the UNDhebar Commission (1961), not the Nehru Commission in 1960. Option (b) is incorrect as  the text states Odisha has the highest number (13) of PVTGs, not exceeding 15, and  does not mention a significant presence in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Option (d) is also incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as PVTGs in *both* Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, indicating they are not unique to a single state.


**2.  Regarding the De-Notified Tribes (DNTs) in India, which statement is factually accurate?**

(a) All nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic.
(b) The Renke Commission (2008) estimated the combined population of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs at over 20 crore Indians.
(c) The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which labeled certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
(d) The Hakki Pikki tribe, a nomadic group from Karnataka, is categorized as a DNT.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) correctly states that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. This historical fact is crucial for understanding the context of DNTs and the stigma associated with their classification under the earlier Act.

Option (a) is incorrect; the text clearly states that all nomadic tribes are *not* DNTs, but all DNTs are nomadic. Option (b) is incorrect because the Renke Commission estimated the combined population at nearly 15 crore, not over 20 crore. Option (d) is incorrect; the Hakki Pikki tribe is described as *semi-nomadic*, not necessarily a DNT.  While some semi-nomadic groups may be included in DNT lists, this is not explicitly stated for the Hakki Pikki tribe in the text.


**3. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) introduced several significant provisions. Which of the following is NOT a provision of this Act?**

(a) A 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
(b) Establishment of a special court in every district for faster adjudication of cases under the Act.
(c) Mandatory 4% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs, including police forces.
(d) Recognition of 21 types of disabilities, including those resulting from acid attacks.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is incorrect. The RPwD Act mandates a 4% reservation in government jobs, but explicitly *excludes* police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT police).  This exception highlights the complexities of implementing inclusive policies across different sectors.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are all accurate reflections of the RPwD Act's provisions.  The Act aims to ensure inclusive education, accessible justice, and a broad definition of disability encompassing a wide range of impairments.


**4. Which of the following statements regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), is accurate?**

(a) The Act defines manual scavengers solely as individuals employed to clean insanitary latrines.
(b)  The Act exempts individuals cleaning human waste if they use appropriate protective gear.
(c) The responsibility for identifying manual scavengers rests solely with the central government.
(d) The Act mandates punishment of only a fine for employing individuals as manual scavengers.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly identifies an exception within the PEMSR Act: individuals cleaning human waste are *not* considered manual scavengers if they use appropriate protective gear and equipment.  This highlights the Act's focus on both prohibiting the practice and promoting safer working conditions.

Option (a) is too narrow; the Act's definition includes various contexts beyond insanitary latrines. Option (c) is incorrect;  the responsibility for identifying manual scavengers is shared between local authorities (municipalities, panchayats, cantonment boards), railway authorities, and the central government. Option (d) is incorrect; the Act mandates punishment that includes imprisonment (up to 2 years) *or* a fine (up to Rs. One Lakh) or both.


**5. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) report provides data on various aspects of hunger.  Which of the following statements about the GHI is NOT correct?**

(a) The GHI is published annually by the World Food Programme.
(b)  The GHI score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the best possible score.
(c) The GHI considers factors such as undernourishment, child stunting, and child mortality.
(d)  The GHI report categorizes countries based on the severity of hunger, using a scale that includes levels such as "Serious" and "Alarming".


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is incorrect. The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Food Programme.  Understanding the source of the GHI is crucial for evaluating its methodology and interpretations.

Options (b), (c), and (d) accurately describe aspects of the GHI report. The GHI uses a scoring system, incorporates multiple indicators of hunger, and categorizes countries into different levels of hunger severity.


**6.  Which of the following statements about the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs is accurate?**

(a) The NIF exclusively uses indicators from the Global Indicator Framework (GIF).
(b) The NIF, as of 2023, comprised less than 200 indicators.
(c) The MoSPI developed guidelines for states/UTs to create their own State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs).
(d) The IAEG-SDGs is solely composed of member states of the UN.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The MoSPI (Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation) did develop guidelines for states and UTs to create their own SIFs (State Indicator Frameworks), aligning with the national framework.  This decentralized approach allows for regional variations while maintaining national coherence.

Option (a) is incorrect; the NIF includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs *in addition* to those from the GIF. Option (b) is incorrect; the NIF in 2023 had 284 indicators. Option (d) is incorrect; the IAEG-SDGs also includes regional and international agencies as observers.


**7.  The text mentions several international organizations involved in social issues. Which of the following pairings of organization and its primary mandate is INCORRECT?**

(a) UNHCR: Protecting refugees and asylum seekers.
(b) GANHRI: Accrediting national human rights institutions.
(c) UNPFII: Addressing issues related to indigenous peoples' economic and social development.
(d) IFPRI: Focusing primarily on promoting global trade and economic growth.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is incorrect. The IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) focuses on reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition through research-based policy solutions, not primarily on global trade and economic growth. The other options accurately reflect the primary mandates of the respective organizations.


**8.  The text discusses various initiatives related to tribal welfare. Which statement regarding the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is INCORRECT?**

(a) It is the nodal ministry responsible for tribal welfare in India.
(b) It observes International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples every year on August 9th.
(c)  Madhya Pradesh has the lowest population of Scheduled Tribes in absolute numbers.
(d) The ministry emphasizes respecting tribal rights to land and forests.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Madhya Pradesh has the *highest* population of Scheduled Tribes in absolute numbers.  The other options accurately reflect the Ministry of Tribal Affairs' role and priorities.

This research center operates in over 60 countries, including India, and offers research-based policy solutions for poverty, hunger, and malnutrition reduction. Which organization is this research center?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c) Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
(d) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question describes the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).  The prompt clearly states that IFPRI was established in 1975 and is a major research center of the CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research), a global partnership founded in 1971.  IFPRI's work aligns perfectly with the description: providing research-based policy solutions to reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition in over 60 countries, including India. Option (a) WFP focuses on food aid and emergency response, not research-based policy solutions. Option (b) FAO works on broader agricultural issues but isn't specifically described as having a major research center like IFPRI. Option (c) CGIAR is the parent organization, not the research center itself.  Therefore, only option (d) accurately reflects the information provided. The detailed description ensures the question is challenging and avoids trivial answers.

This report also indicated that a substantial percentage of the forcibly displaced population consisted of children, and that a significant portion of the world's refugees were hosted by low- and middle-income countries. Which organization released this report?**

(a)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(b)  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(c)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) is the correct answer.  The question details align precisely with the UNHCR's mandate and activities. The UNHCR is dedicated to protecting refugees and forcibly displaced people, making the release of a report on forced displacement entirely consistent with its role.  The statistics on the percentage of children among the displaced and the distribution of refugees across countries are also within the scope of UNHCR's work and data collection.  Options (a), (b), and (d) focus on different aspects of human rights, indigenous issues, and broader economic and social development, respectively.  Their mandates do not directly relate to the specific content of the described report.


**3. The Paris Principles, adopted in 1993 by the UN General Assembly, set standards for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) globally.  An organization established in 1993, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, is responsible for reviewing and accrediting these NHRIs based on their compliance with the Paris Principles.  This organization recently deferred the accreditation of a particular National Human Rights Commission.  Which organization is this?**

(a) UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(b) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(c) UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(d) UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is the correct answer. The question's description directly matches GANHRI's functions: accrediting NHRIs based on the Paris Principles, which it helped develop. The mention of a deferred accreditation further reinforces this.  The other options are involved in human rights but do not have the specific mandate of accrediting NHRIs based on the Paris Principles.  The UNCRC focuses on children's rights, UNDESA on broader economic and social issues, and the UNPFII on indigenous issues.  These organizations do not typically conduct accreditation reviews of NHRIs as described.


**4.  A report, released in 2023, assessed the progress of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and found that progress on more than half of the targets is weak, with some targets having stalled or even reversed. This report highlighted the lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the interconnected climate, biodiversity, and pollution crises. Which organization released this report?**

(a) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(b) World Food Programme (WFP)
(c) UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(d) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) is responsible for the release of this report.  UNDESA plays a central role in monitoring and reporting on the SDGs.  The report's focus on the broad range of SDG progress, the impact of global crises, and the interconnected nature of environmental and social challenges aligns perfectly with UNDESA's mandate.  The other options, while involved in development and humanitarian efforts, do not have the primary responsibility for comprehensive SDG monitoring and reporting.  UNFPA focuses on population issues, WFP on food security, and IFPRI on food policy research.  The breadth of the described report's scope points directly to UNDESA.


**5. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), released by a specific organization, aims to transform India's school education system.

(a) University Grants Commission (UGC)
(b) National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
(c) Ministry of Education
(d) All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) is the organization responsible for releasing the NCF-SE. The NCERT is the primary body for curriculum development and educational research in India. The description of the NCF-SE's content—a new schooling structure, emphasis on multilingualism, scientific inquiry, and interdisciplinary studies—directly relates to the NCERT's mandate.  The other organizations, while involved in education, do not have the primary responsibility for creating national curriculum frameworks. The UGC focuses on higher education, the Ministry of Education on broader educational policy, and AICTE on technical education.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR) is the correct answer.  The description explicitly mentions the four ranking criteria (quality of education, employability, faculty quality, and research performance), which are the specific factors used by CWUR. The inclusion of many Indian universities and the mention of a specific Indian Institute's ranking are also consistent with CWUR's global ranking methodology.  Times Higher Education and QS Quacquarelli Symonds use different ranking criteria, while NIRF is a national-level ranking system for Indian institutions.  Only CWUR matches the details provided in the question.


**7.  The National Medical Commission (NMC), a statutory body under the NMC Act of 2019, recently received recognition from a global organization for a ten-year period. This recognition covers existing and new medical colleges in India, ensuring their accreditation. Which organization granted this recognition?**

(a) World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) World Federation for Medical Education (WFME)
(c)  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
(d)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)

What is the name of this advanced sanitation status?**

(a)  ODF+ Model Village
(b)  ODF+ Village
(c)  Clean India Mission
(d)  Sustainable Sanitation Status

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The correct answer is (b) ODF+ Village. The question's description directly defines the advanced sanitation status as going beyond basic ODF by including either solid or liquid waste management. This is precisely what the ODF+ Village designation signifies.  While (a) ODF+ Model Village is a more stringent version, the question doesn't specify this higher level. Option (c) is a broader program and not a specific sanitation status. Option (d) is a general term, not a specific designation within the Swachh Bharat Mission.


**9.  A specific Act, enacted in 2013, aims to prevent and penalize a particular practice, including employment related to handling un-decomposed human waste. This practice is illegal and carries penalties including imprisonment and fines. What is the name of this Act?**

The question directly describes the Act's purpose: preventing and penalizing manual scavenging and providing for the rehabilitation of those involved.  The other options address different social issues: domestic violence, disability rights, and atrocities against scheduled castes and tribes.  Only option (c) accurately reflects the Act focused on the specific practice described.


**10.  An initiative launched in 2017 under the Ministry of Women and Child Development aims to reduce stunting and improve nutritional status by enhancing the utilization of key services provided at a specific type of community facility. What is the name of this initiative?**

(b)  National Health Policy 2017
(c)  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan
(d)  Intensified Mission Indradhanush

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Nutrition Mission (NNM), also known as POSHAN Abhiyan, is the correct answer. The question describes the initiative's focus on reducing stunting, improving nutrition, and utilizing services provided at community facilities, which directly aligns with POSHAN Abhiyan's goals and implementation strategies.  The other options cover different aspects of health and welfare but do not specifically focus on nutrition and community-based service delivery in the way described.


**1.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is associated with which global partnership focused on research for food security?**

(a) The World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
(c) The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(d) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The IFPRI, established in 1975, is a major research center of the CGIAR.  CGIAR is a global partnership established in 1971, dedicated to research for a food-secure future.  While IFPRI collaborates with other organizations like the FAO and UNDP, its direct affiliation and primary association are with CGIAR.  The WFP, while focused on food security, is a separate UN agency and not the primary global partnership IFPRI is part of.  Therefore, option (b) accurately reflects IFPRI's organizational structure and its role within the global food security research landscape.  The question tests factual recall about IFPRI's organizational structure and its relationship with other key players in global food security.

(c) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d) UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UNHCR, established in 1950, is the UN agency mandated to protect refugees and assist those forcibly displaced from their homes due to conflict and persecution. The report "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022" falls squarely within the UNHCR's mandate. UNDESA focuses on broader economic and social development goals, UNCPD addresses population and development issues, and UNCRC focuses on the rights of children.  The question assesses factual recall of the UN agency responsible for refugee affairs and its key publications.


**3.  The Paris Principles, adopted in 1993, are crucial for the work of which organization focused on accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs)?**

(a) UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(b) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(c) UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(d) UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Paris Principles provide standards for the development of NHRIs globally.  GANHRI, established in 1993, uses these principles as the basis for reviewing and accrediting NHRIs. The other organizations listed have different mandates; UNPFII focuses on indigenous issues, UNCRC on children's rights, and OHCHR on broader human rights matters. The question tests understanding of the standards used for the accreditation of human rights institutions and the organization that employs them.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, released the "Triple Threat Report" focusing on the interconnected risks of inadequate WASH services, high mortality rates attributable to unsafe WASH, and high climate vulnerability for children.  While WHO and the World Bank work on health and development, respectively, this specific report falls under UNICEF's mandate to protect children's well-being.  IFPRI focuses on food policy research and is not involved in such reports.  The question tests knowledge of reports focusing on child health and well-being and the organization responsible for such reports.

The question tests detailed knowledge of recent amendments to surrogacy regulations.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  Each question is designed to test specific knowledge and avoid ambiguity.  The difficulty is achieved through plausible distractors and requiring precise recall of details.


**1.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects the status of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a)  The highest number of PVTGs are concentrated in Madhya Pradesh, reflecting its large tribal population.
(b)  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, high literacy rates, and significant economic advancement.
(c)  Odisha currently harbors the most PVTGs, exceeding the number found in any other state.
(d)  The government's renaming of Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) to PVTGs occurred in 1973, following the recommendations of the UNDhebar Commission.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  While Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of STs overall, Odisha has the largest number of designated PVTGs. The other options contain inaccuracies. Option (a) misrepresents the state with the highest concentration of PVTGs. Option (b) incorrectly describes the criteria for PVTG designation;  low literacy and economic backwardness are key factors, not advancement. Option (d) is incorrect regarding the timeline of the renaming; the change from PTGs to PVTGs happened in 2006, not 1973.  The UNDhebar Commission's recommendations were a foundational step, but the name change occurred much later.  Understanding the nuanced difference between overall tribal population and the specific categorization of PVTGs is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of India's tribal demographics.


**2. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) has a primary mandate of:**

(a)  Implementing rehabilitation programs for manual scavengers.
(b)  Creating a comprehensive national database of all nomadic communities in India.
(c)  Developing and implementing skill development programs for PVTGs.
(d)  Compiling a state-wise list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) accurately describes the NCDNT's core function.  The commission's role is specifically focused on creating state-wise lists of DNT castes.  The other options are incorrect;  rehabilitation of manual scavengers falls under a different set of initiatives (option a).  While the NCDNT's work indirectly relates to nomadic communities (option b), its primary mandate is not the creation of a comprehensive national database.  Similarly, skill development for PVTGs is handled by other agencies and ministries (option c).  This question tests the understanding of specific government bodies and their areas of responsibility within the broader context of social welfare and tribal development.


**3.  Which of the following is NOT a key feature of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act)?**

(a)  Recognition of 21 types of disabilities, including those resulting from acid attacks.
(b)  Mandatory 4% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs, including police forces.
(c)  Provision for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between 6 and 18 years of age.
(d)  Establishment of special courts in each district for faster adjudication of cases under the Act.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is incorrect. The RPwD Act mandates reservation for PwDs in government jobs, but this exclusion specifically applies to police forces.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are all accurate representations of the act's provisions.  The question tests the ability to identify a specific exception within a broader policy framework.  Knowing the limitations of the reservation policy is essential for analyzing the effectiveness of the RPwD Act in ensuring equal opportunities for PwDs in India.


**4. Regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), which statement is FALSE?**

(a)  It mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines.
(b)  It defines manual scavengers to include those using appropriate protective gear while cleaning human waste.
(c)  It criminalizes the employment of individuals to clean sewers and septic tanks without protective gear.
(d)  It outlines procedures for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, including alternative employment opportunities.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is false. The PEMSR Act explicitly excludes those cleaning human waste with appropriate protective gear from the definition of manual scavengers. The other options accurately reflect the Act's provisions.  This question tests the precise understanding of legal definitions and the nuances within social legislation.  Misinterpreting the definition of manual scavengers can lead to flawed analyses of the Act's impact and effectiveness.



**5.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for:**

(a)  A rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level.
(b)  Proficiency in at least three languages, with at least one being a foreign language.
(c)  A move towards a semester-based academic calendar instead of an annual system.
(d)  Eliminating vocational education from the school curriculum.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The NCF-SE promotes a shift to a semester system. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. Option (a) contradicts the NCF-SE's emphasis on flexibility and integrated learning. Option (b) misrepresents the language policy, which prioritizes Indian languages. Option (d) is wrong; the NCF-SE emphasizes vocational education integration.  This question assesses the understanding of educational reforms and policy recommendations.


**6. Which of the following is NOT a key finding of the India Ageing Report 2023, released by UNFPA in collaboration with IIPS?**

(a) India's population surpassed China's in mid-2023, becoming the world's most populous nation.
(b)  A significant portion of India's population falls within the young adult age group (15-64 years).
(c)  India’s fertility rate has consistently risen since 2015-16.
(d)  The proportion of India's population above 65 years is currently around 7%.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is incorrect.  The report shows a decline in India's fertility rate since 2015-16, not a rise.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all accurate reflections of the report's findings. This question tests the ability to recall specific data points from a particular report and demonstrates an understanding of demographic trends in India.



**7. The Global Food Policy Report 2023, released by IFPRI, primarily focuses on:**

(a)  Promoting sustainable agricultural practices in developing countries.
(b)  Re-evaluating strategies for responding to food crises.
(c)  Analyzing the impact of climate change on global food security.
(d)  Developing new technologies for improving crop yields.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) accurately reflects the central theme of the IFPRI report.  The report emphasizes a critical examination of existing approaches to food crisis management.  While the other options are related to food security, they are not the primary focus of this specific report. This question tests the understanding of the scope and content of specific research publications in the field of global food security.

(c)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The UNCRC committee is the body specifically tasked with monitoring the convention's implementation. The other options represent organizations with different mandates.  This question tests the knowledge of international organizations and their specific roles in global governance and human rights.


**MCQs Based on Target Content:**

**1.  A global partnership established in 1971, focused on research for a food-secure future, is the central body of which major research center established in 1975?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(c) Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
(d) United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on identifying the parent organization of IFPRI.  The passage explicitly states that IFPRI is a major research center of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).  CGIAR's establishment date (1971) and its focus on research for a food-secure future are also mentioned. Option (a), WFP, is a separate UN agency. Option (b) is the organization itself. Option (d), UNDESA, is a different UN department. Therefore, only option (c) correctly identifies the parent organization.  Understanding the organizational structure of international bodies involved in food security is crucial for UPSC preparation, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the question. The correct answer demonstrates knowledge of global organizations and their interrelationships.


**2. Which organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, works in 137 countries, including India, to protect the rights of those forced to flee their homes due to conflict and persecution?**

(a) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(b) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c) UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(d) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question demands knowledge of international organizations working on refugee issues. The passage directly describes the UNHCR's mandate, location, and area of operation.  Option (a), GANHRI, focuses on human rights institutions. Option (c), UNPFII, deals with indigenous issues. Option (d), IFPRI, concentrates on food policy research.  Only the UNHCR (option b) directly aligns with the provided description, demonstrating factual recall of key international organizations and their functions. The correct option showcases an understanding of humanitarian organizations and their roles in addressing global challenges, which is a frequent theme in UPSC examinations.


**3.  The 2023 Global Food Policy Report, highlighting rethinking food crisis responses, was released by which organization?**

(a) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(b) UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(c) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d) World Food Programme (WFP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question assesses factual recall regarding the source of a specific publication. The passage clearly states that IFPRI released the Global Food Policy Report 2023. Options (a), (b), and (d) represent other international organizations; while relevant to global issues, they are not the source of the specific report mentioned. This question tests direct recall of information, a fundamental skill for UPSC preparation.  The focus on a specific report and its author demonstrates the need for precise recall of information sources, a skill essential for effective analysis and argumentation in the exam.


**4. Which organization's 2022 report, titled "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022," highlighted a 21% increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises compared to 2021?**

(a) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(b) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c) UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(d) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** This question tests the ability to link a specific report to its publishing organization.  The passage clearly attributes the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" to the UNHCR. The other options, while relevant to global issues, did not publish this specific report.  The question necessitates a precise understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different UN agencies, demonstrating the importance of detailed knowledge for UPSC success.  The specific data point (21% increase) further enhances the difficulty level and assesses detailed factual recall.


**5. The deferral of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)'s accreditation, citing concerns such as political interference and poor cooperation with civil society, was done by which organization?**

(a) UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(b) UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(c) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question requires understanding the roles of various international organizations in monitoring human rights. The passage directly states that GANHRI deferred the NHRC's accreditation. The other options are involved in different areas of human rights or other global issues. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific international human rights bodies and their functions. The specific reasons for the deferral (political interference, etc.) further challenge the candidate’s knowledge, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of global governance mechanisms for UPSC success.


**6. Which report, released in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), focuses on India's aging population?**

(a)  State of World Population Report 2023
(b) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
(c) India Ageing Report 2023
(d) Global Report on Food Crisis


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The question tests knowledge of specific reports and their authors. The passage clearly identifies the UNFPA as the releaser of the India Ageing Report 2023, in collaboration with IIPS. The other options represent different reports focusing on different global issues.  This question highlights the importance of recognizing specific reports and their relevance to demographic trends and social policy, a key aspect of UPSC preparation.  The inclusion of IIPS as a collaborating organization further increases the question's difficulty.


**7. The Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN), launched on Janjatiya Gaurav Divas (Tribal Pride Day), aims to saturate which specific group's households and habitations with basic facilities?**

(a) Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b) Other Backward Classes (OBCs)
(c) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(d)  All marginalized communities


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question assesses knowledge of government schemes and their target beneficiaries. The passage explicitly states that PM JANMAN aims to saturate PVTG households and habitations.  Options (a) and (b) refer to different marginalized groups. Option (d) is too broad.  This question demonstrates the need for specific knowledge of government initiatives targeting vulnerable populations, a crucial component of UPSC preparation. The specific name of the scheme and its target group increase the difficulty.


**8.  The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), currently includes how many indicators?**

(a) 231
(b) 248
(c) 284
(d) 50


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question evaluates the precise recall of numerical data related to a specific policy initiative. The passage explicitly states that the 2023 NIF includes 284 indicators. Options (a) and (b) refer to the number of indicators in the Global Indicator Framework (GIF). Option (d) is significantly lower than the actual number. This question tests the ability to recall specific numerical information, highlighting the importance of precise data recall in the UPSC exam.  The presence of plausible distractors (numbers from the GIF) increases the difficulty.


**9. Which act, amended in 2019, sought to address concerns regarding the lack of diversity in the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)?**

(a) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(b) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c) The Protection of Human Rights Act
(d) The National Medical Commission Act, 2019


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question tests knowledge of specific legislation and its amendments. The passage mentions that an amendment to the Protection of Human Rights Act in 2019 aimed to improve the NHRC's diversity.  The other options are unrelated to the NHRC's composition. This question demonstrates the need for precise knowledge of legal frameworks related to human rights and governance in India, a significant area in the UPSC syllabus.  The specific year (2019) of the amendment increases the difficulty level.


**10.  The  "triple threat" of WASH-related challenges for children, as defined by UNICEF's Triple Threat Report, involves which three factors?**

(a)  Lack of access to basic sanitation, high neonatal mortality rates, and climate change risks.
(b) Less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation, a high burden of WASH-attributable deaths among children under 5, and high climate and environmental risks.
(c) High rates of child malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, and inadequate sanitation facilities.
(d) Water scarcity, poor hygiene practices, and lack of educational opportunities.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** This question assesses understanding of a specific report and its key concepts. The passage defines UNICEF's "triple threat" as less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation, a high burden of WASH-attributable deaths among children under 5, and high climate and environmental risks.  The other options, while related to children's well-being, do not accurately represent UNICEF's specific definition.  This question requires a nuanced understanding of the report's framework and its implications for child health and development, demonstrating the analytical skills needed for UPSC success.  The detailed definition of the "triple threat" makes the question challenging.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills, with a detailed explanation for the correct answer and analysis of the distractors.

**1.  Which of the following statements accurately describes the legal status of same-sex marriage in India, as per a recent Supreme Court ruling?**

(a)  Same-sex marriage is legally recognized under existing laws.
(b)  The Supreme Court declined to interpret existing laws in a gender-neutral manner to allow same-sex marriage.
(c)  The Supreme Court mandated the government to recognize civil unions for same-sex couples.
(d)  The Supreme Court upheld the right of transgender persons to marry in heterosexual relations.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** A recent Supreme Court ruling in India clarified that there is no fundamental right to same-sex marriage under existing laws. The Court declined to interpret the Special Marriage Act (SMA) or other relevant laws in a gender-neutral way to allow same-sex marriage, stating that such an interpretation would be an overreach of judicial power and best left to the legislature. While the Court acknowledged the rights of transgender individuals in heterosexual relationships to marry, it did not extend this recognition to same-sex couples. The option (c) is incorrect because the court explicitly rejected the idea of prescribing civil unions as a solution.  Option (a) is incorrect as the ruling explicitly stated the opposite. Option (d) is partially true but doesn't represent the main point of the ruling regarding same-sex marriage.


**2. The "Prayatna" project, highlighted in a recent NITI Aayog report, focuses primarily on which of the following initiatives?**

(a)  Providing healthcare services to transgender individuals in Delhi-NCR.
(b)  Offering entrepreneurship training and livelihood support to transgender people in Delhi-NCR.
(c)  Advocating for the legal rights of transgender people in Delhi-NCR.
(d)  Establishing shelter homes for transgender people in Delhi-NCR.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Prayatna project is specifically designed to improve the quality of life for transgender individuals in the Delhi-NCR region by providing them with skills training in entrepreneurship and other livelihood opportunities. While the project may indirectly contribute to other areas like improved social standing or access to resources, its core focus is on economic empowerment through skill development and job creation. Options (a), (c), and (d), although related to the welfare of transgender people, are not the primary aims of the Prayatna project.


**3.  According to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, which of the following scenarios is now permitted regarding the use of donor gametes in surrogacy?**

(a)  Commercial surrogacy using donor gametes is allowed.
(b)  The use of donor gametes is completely prohibited.
(c)  Surrogacy using donor gametes is allowed only if at least one gamete is from the intending couple.
(d)  Single women can use donor eggs and donor sperm for surrogacy.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The amendment rules allow surrogacy using donor gametes under specific conditions: the resulting child must have at least one gamete (either egg or sperm) from one of the intending parents. This addresses situations where medical conditions prevent the use of the couple's own gametes.  Option (a) is incorrect because commercial surrogacy remains prohibited. Option (b) is incorrect because the amendment explicitly allows surrogacy with donor gametes under certain conditions. Option (d) is partially correct but incomplete as the condition of one gamete from intending parents is not mentioned.


**4. Which of the following best describes the key change introduced by the MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, concerning abortion access in India?**

(a)  Complete liberalization of abortion laws, allowing termination at any stage of pregnancy.
(b)  Extension of the gestational limit for abortion from 20 to 24 weeks for all women.
(c)  Allowing abortion only in cases of rape or incest.
(d)  Extension of the gestational limit for certain categories of women, including those facing specific medical circumstances.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The 2021 amendment to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act significantly expanded access to abortion services in India. The most important change is the extension of the gestational limit for abortion to 24 weeks for certain categories of women, especially those facing medical complications or other specific circumstances.  The act does not completely liberalize abortion, and the gestational limit is not universally extended to 24 weeks for all women. Options (a), (b), and (c) are oversimplifications or misrepresentations of the amendment’s key changes.


**5.  The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) recently issued guidelines for which specific aspect of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015?**

(a)  Adoption procedures for children in need of care and protection.
(b)  Establishing childcare institutions for orphaned children.
(c)  Assessment of child suspects involved in heinous offenses.
(d)  Rehabilitation programs for child laborers.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** NCPCR's new guidelines specifically focus on the assessment procedures for child suspects accused of heinous offenses under the Juvenile Justice Act.  These guidelines aim to ensure that such assessments are conducted fairly and thoroughly, taking into account the unique vulnerabilities of children while also upholding the principles of justice. Options (a), (b), and (d), while relevant to the overall framework of child protection, are not the specific focus of the NCPCR guidelines in question.


**6. The "Triple Threat" report by UNICEF highlights which interconnected challenges faced by children related to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)?**

(a)  High cost of WASH services, lack of awareness, and inadequate infrastructure.
(b)  Limited access to basic WASH services, high mortality due to unsafe WASH, and high risk from climate hazards.
(c)  Water scarcity, sanitation issues in schools, and lack of hygiene education.
(d)  Poor water quality, inadequate sanitation facilities in healthcare settings, and spread of waterborne diseases.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** UNICEF's "Triple Threat" report focuses on the convergence of three major threats related to WASH: insufficient access to basic WASH services (water and sanitation), a high burden of WASH-related deaths among children under five, and a significant risk of climate and environmental hazards impacting WASH access.  These three factors are interconnected and exacerbate each other, creating a particularly challenging situation for children's health and well-being.  Options (a), (c), and (d) represent aspects of WASH challenges but do not capture the interconnectedness highlighted in UNICEF's report.


**7.  Which ministry is the nodal agency for implementing the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN)?**

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Panchayati Raj


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** While PM JANMAN involves multiple ministries, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs serves as the nodal ministry, coordinating the implementation of this initiative aimed at improving the lives of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  The other ministries play supporting roles in delivering specific components of the program.


**8.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 categorizes India's hunger situation as:**

(a) Low
(b) Moderate
(c) Serious
(d) Alarming


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The GHI 2023 report categorizes India's hunger situation as "Serious," reflecting the country's ranking and score on the index.  This classification indicates a significant level of hunger and malnutrition, requiring concerted efforts to address the underlying causes.


**9.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate credits earned through which three main educational pathways?**

(a)  Higher education, vocational training, and online learning.
(b)  School education, higher education, and online learning.
(c)  School education, higher education, and vocational & skill education.
(d)  Higher education, vocational training, and apprenticeship programs.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF is designed to create a unified framework for accumulating and transferring credits earned across school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education. This holistic approach aims to provide learners with greater flexibility and mobility in their educational journeys.


**10.  Which of the following is a key recommendation of the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee regarding the accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in India?**

(a)  The complete abolition of the existing accreditation system.
(b)  A transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited).
(c)  The establishment of a new ranking system independent of accreditation.
(d)  Maintaining the existing eight-point grading system for accreditation.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a shift from the existing multi-point grading system to a binary system (Accredited/Not Accredited) for HEI accreditation. This aims to simplify the process and make it more transparent and efficient.  The other options are not consistent with the committee's recommendations.


**1.  Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023, collaborating with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)?**

(a)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(d)  United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question specifically asks about the organization that released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with IIPS.  The provided text clearly states that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) released this report.  The other options are incorrect because they are different UN agencies with distinct mandates.  WHO focuses on global health, UNDP on international development, and UNICEF on children's rights and welfare.  These organizations might release reports related to population aging or India, but the specific report mentioned in the question is explicitly attributed to UNFPA.  This demonstrates factual recall and understanding of the roles of various UN agencies.


**2.  Which Act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, impacting the legal status of Denotified Tribes in India?**

(a)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b)  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(c)  The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the legislation that superseded the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871. The passage explicitly states that the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952 repealed the Criminal Tribes Act.  The other options are irrelevant to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.  While the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act addresses discrimination against marginalized communities, it doesn't directly relate to the repeal of the 1871 Act. Similarly, the Protection of Human Rights Act and its amendments focus on human rights protection, not the specific legal history of Denotified Tribes. This question tests factual recall of historical legislation impacting specific marginalized communities.


**3.  Which committee's recommendations led to the renaming of Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in 2006?**

(a)  The Mandal Commission
(b)  The Sarkaria Commission
(c)  The UNDhebar Commission
(d)  The Kakodkar Committee

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question probes the source of the name change for a specific category of tribal groups. The text explicitly mentions that the renaming of PTGs to PVTGs in 2006 was based on recommendations from the UNDhebar Commission (1961). The other commissions mentioned dealt with different aspects of governance and administration, making them inappropriate answers.  The Mandal Commission focused on OBC reservations, the Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State relations, and the Kakodkar Committee on nuclear energy. The correct answer demonstrates knowledge of historical commissions and their impact on policy regarding tribal welfare.


**4.  Which government scheme aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and is associated with Anganwadi Centers?**

(a)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana
(c)  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme
(d)  National Health Mission

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question asks about a specific government program related to child and maternal health and nutrition. The text clearly links the Anganwadi system to the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.  While Ayushman Bharat Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, and the National Health Mission are all significant health initiatives, they don't directly manage the Anganwadi system or its specific goals.  The ICDS scheme is explicitly mentioned as the umbrella program under which Anganwadi services operate, making it the correct answer. This question tests understanding of government welfare schemes and their interconnections.


**5.  Which act governs inter- and intra-country adoption of orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered children and children of relatives in India?**

(a)  Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956
(b)  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c)  Guardians and Wards Act, 1890
(d)  Special Marriage Act, 1954

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the legal framework for child adoption in India. The text explicitly states that the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and its associated regulations govern inter- and intra-country adoption of children.  While the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act deals with adoption within the Hindu community, it doesn't encompass the broader scope of adoptions covered by the Juvenile Justice Act.  The Guardians and Wards Act and Special Marriage Act deal with guardianship and marriage, respectively, and are not relevant to child adoption.  The correct response demonstrates understanding of the legal aspects of child welfare.


**6.  Which High-Level Committee developed the National Credit Framework (NCrF) in accordance with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020?**

(a)  The Kasturirangan Committee
(b)  The Radhakrishnan Committee
(c)  A committee chaired by the Prime Minister
(d)  A committee with members from UGC, AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, and Ministries of Education and Skill Development

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question seeks to identify the body responsible for creating the NCrF.  The provided text clearly states that the NCrF was developed by a High-Level Committee with representatives from several organizations and ministries, including UGC, AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, and the Ministries of Education and Skill Development.  The other options are incorrect because they refer to different committees focused on other aspects of education reform.  The Kasturirangan Committee worked on the NCF-SE, and the Radhakrishnan Committee dealt with accreditation reforms.  A Prime Minister-chaired committee might oversee education policy but is not directly linked to the NCrF's creation.  This question assesses understanding of the institutional mechanisms behind educational policy implementation.


**7.  Which ministry is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare in India?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Panchayati Raj

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly asks for the government ministry responsible for tribal welfare. The text explicitly identifies the Ministry of Tribal Affairs as the nodal ministry for this area.  The other options are incorrect; while the other ministries might have programs touching upon tribal welfare, they are not the primary or designated ministry for this purpose.  This is a straightforward factual recall question testing basic knowledge of Indian government structure.


**8.  Which international organization released the report titled ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’?**

(a)  International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IFRC)
(d)  Doctors Without Borders (MSF)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question asks about the source of a specific report on forced displacement. The text explicitly states that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) released the ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’. The other options are involved in humanitarian work but are not the source of this particular report.  IOM deals with migration, IFRC with disaster relief, and MSF with medical aid.  This question demonstrates understanding of international organizations and their areas of expertise.


**9.  Which global index measures economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment for women?**

(a)  Global Hunger Index
(b)  Gender Social Norms Index
(c)  Global Gender Gap Index
(d)  Human Development Index

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes an index measuring gender equality across several dimensions. The text clearly states that the Global Gender Gap Index, released by the World Economic Forum, measures economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment for women.  The other indices measure different aspects of development and well-being; the Global Hunger Index focuses on food security, the Gender Social Norms Index on gender norms, and the Human Development Index on broader human development. This question tests knowledge of global development indices and their scope.


**10. Which organization jointly released the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI) with the World Bank?**

(a) UNICEF
(b) UNDP
(c) World Health Organization (WHO)
(d) International Monetary Fund (IMF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the partnership releasing a specific health index. The text explicitly mentions that the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank jointly released the UHC SCI. The other organizations are involved in development, but not in this specific partnership.  This is a straightforward factual recall question.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring accurate recall and conceptual understanding, and includes plausible distractors.

**1.  A government initiative aims to improve the livelihood and entrepreneurial skills of a marginalized community in Delhi-NCR.  This program, approved by PMKVY, focuses on skill development and business training. Which community is the primary beneficiary of this initiative?**

(a)  Members of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in Madhya Pradesh
(b)  Individuals belonging to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in Karnataka
(c)  Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) seeking employment opportunities
(d)  Members of the transgender community


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The description clearly points to the "Prayatna" project, explicitly mentioned in the text as a livelihood and enterprise training program for transgender people in Delhi-NCR. Options (a), (b), and (c) refer to different vulnerable groups, but the question's focus on skill development and entrepreneurship in Delhi-NCR directly aligns with the Prayatna project's stated goals for the transgender community.  The mention of PMKVY further reinforces the connection.  The other options, while representing other vulnerable groups, are not the primary focus of the described program.


**2.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has faced challenges in obtaining international recognition from a global alliance of human rights institutions.  This alliance, based in Geneva, evaluates and accredits national human rights institutions based on established principles. Which organization is responsible for the NHRC's accreditation status?**

(a)  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(b)  The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(c)  The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d)  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage directly states that the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) deferred the NHRC's accreditation.  The details provided about GANHRI's role in reviewing and accrediting national human rights institutions, its location in Geneva, and the reasons for the NHRC's accreditation deferral clearly indicate GANHRI as the correct answer. The other organizations, while involved in human rights or related fields, do not have the specific responsibility for accrediting national human rights institutions as described.


**3. A legal framework aims to prevent the exploitation of individuals involved in the removal of human waste from unsanitary environments. This legislation mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines, provides for the rehabilitation of affected individuals, and outlines penalties for violations. Which Act addresses this specific issue?**

(a)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR)
(b)  The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019
(c)  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act)
(d)  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The description aligns perfectly with the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR). This Act specifically addresses manual scavenging, outlining measures to prevent it, rehabilitate those affected, and impose penalties on violators.  The other options address different vulnerable groups and social issues but do not directly deal with the specific problem of manual scavenging and its associated legal ramifications.


**4.  A government report highlights the challenges faced by a group identified as particularly vulnerable among Scheduled Tribes.  This report details criteria for identifying this group, including pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. Which specific group is the subject of this report?**

(a)  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)
(b)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(c)  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(d)  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description precisely matches the criteria used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). The text explicitly states that PVTGs are centrally recognized special categories among Scheduled Tribes, identified based on pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. The other options represent broader categories of marginalized communities but do not specifically meet the criteria described in the question.


**5. A national-level initiative aims to reduce stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence among children. This program utilizes digital technology to track nutrition service delivery and identify areas needing intervention. It leverages a mobile-based application and a multi-tier dashboard to monitor nutrition-related progress.  Which program best fits this description?**

(a)  The National Family Health Survey (NFHS)
(b)  The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan
(c)  The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme
(d)  The Intensified Mission Indradhanush


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description strongly points to the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan. The text explicitly mentions the use of the "Poshan Tracker" app for monitoring nutrition service delivery and the identification of stunting, wasting, and underweight children.  While ICDS is related to child nutrition, the specific use of the Poshan Tracker and the focus on digital monitoring are key features of POSHAN Abhiyan. The other options address broader health and immunization programs but do not possess the described digital tracking and monitoring components.


**6.  A government commission was established to address the needs of a specific group of communities. These communities were historically labeled as "born criminals" during the British Raj, and the commission's report recommended the establishment of a permanent body to represent their interests. Which group is the focus of this commission?**

(a)  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(b)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(c)  De-notified Tribes (DNTs)
(d)  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description refers to the Idate Commission's report and its focus on De-notified Tribes (DNTs). The text specifically links DNTs to the historical "born criminal" label under the British Criminal Tribes Act and mentions the commission's recommendation for a permanent body for DNTs.  While other marginalized groups face challenges, the historical context and the commission's specific focus directly point to DNTs.


**7.  An Act seeks to regulate and supervise Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) clinics and banks, preventing misuse and ensuring ethical practices. This Act also incorporates provisions related to surrogacy, aiming to protect the rights of surrogate mothers. Which Act fulfills this description?**

(a)  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
(b)  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021
(c)  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971
(d)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description directly aligns with the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021. This Act specifically addresses the regulation of ART clinics and banks, including provisions related to surrogacy.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, while related, is a separate piece of legislation.  The other options address different aspects of healthcare and social welfare.


**8.  A framework for school education aims to integrate credits earned through various educational pathways, including school education, higher education, and vocational training. This framework seeks to promote flexibility and lifelong learning, allowing students to accumulate and transfer credits earned through different modes of learning. Which framework is being described?**

(a)  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)
(b)  The National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(c)  The National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(d)  The National Credit Framework (NCrF)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The description perfectly matches the National Credit Framework (NCrF).  The text explicitly states that the NCrF integrates credits from school, higher education, and vocational training to promote flexibility and lifelong learning. The other options represent frameworks focused on specific aspects of the education system but do not encompass the credit integration and transfer mechanism described.


**9.  A report examines the impact of various crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical conflicts, on global food security. This report highlights the rise in food insecurity and the surge in food prices in recent years. Which organization is most likely to have published such a report?**

(a)  The World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description strongly suggests the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) as the likely publisher of the report.  The text mentions IFPRI's focus on reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, along with its research-based policy solutions.  While WFP is also involved in food security, IFPRI's research-oriented nature makes it the more appropriate source for a report analyzing the impact of various crises on food security. The other options focus on different aspects of international development.


**10. A high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) deals specifically with indigenous issues. This body consists of independent experts, with some nominated by governments and others by indigenous organizations.  Which organization does this description refer to?**

(a)  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(b)  The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(c)  The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(d)  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description accurately reflects the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII). The text explicitly states that UNPFII is a high-level advisory body to ECOSOC, composed of independent experts nominated by both governments and indigenous organizations.  The other options address different aspects of international relations and human rights but do not have the specific mandate and structure described.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assesses various cognitive skills.


**1.  The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India is found in which state?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Andaman and Nicobar Islands
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, the question specifically asks about PVTGs, a distinct and smaller subset within the Scheduled Tribe population.  Chhattisgarh has some PVTGs, but not the highest number.  Andaman and Nicobar Islands also has PVTGs, but fewer than Odisha.  The question tests factual recall of a specific statistic.


**2.  Which commission's recommendations led to the initial recognition of Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973?**

(a) Renke Commission
(b) Idate Commission
(c) U.N. Dhebar Commission
(d) National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that PTGs (later renamed PVTGs) were first recognized in 1973 based on the recommendations of the U.N. Dhebar Commission (1961). The other commissions mentioned deal with different aspects of marginalized communities. The Renke Commission focused on nomadic tribes, the Idate Commission on De-notified Tribes, and the NCDNT is a more recent body. This question tests factual recall of a historical commission and its impact.


**3. Which of the following criteria is NOT used for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High level of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) A declining or stagnant population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly lists three criteria for identifying PVTGs: pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, and economic backwardness, along with a declining or stagnant population.  A high level of literacy would directly contradict the characteristic of vulnerability associated with PVTGs. This question tests the ability to identify inconsistencies within a set of criteria and requires conceptual understanding of the term "vulnerable."


**4.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has recently emphasized the implementation of a report focusing on which specific group of marginalized communities?**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly states that the NHRC stressed the need to implement the Idate Commission report, which is specifically concerned with De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs).  The other options are distinct categories of marginalized communities addressed by separate policies and initiatives. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the NHRC's mandate.


**5. Which Ministry is the nodal ministry responsible for the implementation of the SEED scheme for the economic empowerment of Denotified Tribes?**

(a) Ministry of Tribal Affairs

(d) Ministry of Panchayati Raj

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is launched by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.  The other ministries deal with other aspects of social welfare, but not the SEED scheme specifically. This question tests factual recall of a specific government scheme and its associated ministry.


**6. Which Act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which had labeled certain communities as "born criminals"?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955
(c) The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text states that the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952.  The other acts address different forms of discrimination and social injustice but do not relate directly to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act. This question tests knowledge of historical legislation and its impact on marginalized communities.


**7.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation percentage for PwDs in which sector is NOT applicable?**

(a) Government jobs
(b) Government-aided higher educational institutions
(c) Police forces
(d) Private sector employment

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Act explicitly states that the 4% reservation in government jobs and 5% reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions apply to PwDs. However, the text also clarifies that this reservation is not applicable to police forces.  The question tests the ability to identify exceptions within a policy framework.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a thorough understanding of the material.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  A government initiative aims to holistically address health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.  Which program best fits this description?**

(a) Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(b) Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission
(c) National Health Policy 2017
(d) Ayushman Bharat Yojana

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The Ayushman Bharat Yojana (ABY) is a comprehensive health insurance scheme designed to provide healthcare access across various levels.  While Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on immunization, ABDM on digital health infrastructure, and the National Health Policy 2017 on overall health policy, ABY directly addresses healthcare access at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels through its insurance coverage and associated healthcare provisions.  The other options address specific aspects of healthcare rather than a holistic approach across all levels.  Understanding the scope and objectives of each program is crucial for selecting the correct answer.  This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of Indian healthcare initiatives.


**2. Which of the following is NOT a key dimension of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as defined by international organizations?**

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c) Availability
(d) Quality

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  While availability of healthcare services is a critical factor contributing to UHC, it's not considered a core *dimension* in the same way accessibility, affordability, and quality are. Accessibility refers to the ease with which individuals can reach healthcare services. Affordability focuses on the financial burden of healthcare on individuals. Quality encompasses the effectiveness, safety, and patient-centeredness of services.  The question tests conceptual understanding of UHC and distinguishes between related but distinct concepts.  The inclusion of "availability" as a plausible distractor increases the difficulty level.


**3.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for a shift from the existing four-stage schooling structure to a new structure. Which of the following accurately represents this new structure?**

(a) Foundational, Preparatory, Middle, Secondary
(b) 5+3+3+4 (based on age groups)
(c) Primary, Upper Primary, Secondary, Higher Secondary
(d) Early Childhood, Primary, Middle, Secondary

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure, which reorganizes the school years based on age groups rather than the traditional four-stage system. This new structure is a key element of the NCF-SE's recommendations for reforming school education in India. Options (a), (c), and (d) represent existing or alternative structures, not the proposed new one outlined in the NCF-SE. This question tests factual recall of the NCF-SE's key features and understanding of educational reforms in India.


**4. Which organization released the Global Food Policy Report 2023: Rethinking food crisis responses?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is the organization responsible for publishing the Global Food Policy Report. While the WFP, UNFPA, and FAO are involved in food security and related issues, this specific report originates from IFPRI.  This question tests factual recall of the source of a specific publication and demonstrates an understanding of various organizations working in the field of global food security.


**5. The "triple burden" of WASH-related threats to children, as defined by UNICEF, includes all EXCEPT:**

(a) Less than 50% access to at least basic water or sanitation services.
(b) High rates of child malnutrition in the affected region.
(c) Being among the top 20 countries with the highest burden of WASH-attributable deaths among children under 5.
(d) Being within the top 25% of countries facing the highest risk of climate and environmental hazards.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** UNICEF's "triple threat" framework focuses on access to WASH services, mortality rates linked to unsafe WASH, and climate risks. Child malnutrition is a separate but related challenge, not a core component of the "triple burden" definition itself. Although malnutrition is often exacerbated by poor WASH conditions, the question requires precise understanding of UNICEF's specific terminology. This question tests the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts and accurately recall specific definitions.


**6.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, repealed which existing statutory body and subsumed its functions?**

(a)  The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
(b) The Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
(c) The University Grants Commission (UGC)
(d) The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Anusandhan NRF Act, 2023, explicitly repealed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008, integrating SERB's functions into the newly established NRF.  The other options are distinct organizations with different mandates, not directly subsumed under the NRF. This question tests knowledge of recent legislation and the organizational restructuring within India's scientific research ecosystem.


**7.  Which of the following is NOT a key feature of the National Credit Framework (NCrF)?**

(a) Integration of credits earned through school, higher education, and vocational training.
(b)  A rigid, non-flexible system preventing students from switching educational paths.
(c)  Use of the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) for digital storage of credits.
(c)  Multiple entry and exit options within the educational system.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCrF explicitly promotes flexibility and mobility in education, enabling multiple entry and exit points.  A rigid system contradicts the core principles of the NCrF.  The other options are all key features designed to create a more flexible and integrated education system. This question assesses understanding of the NCrF's design and its intended impact on the Indian education system.


**8.  The  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education systems uses data from which two primary sources?**

(a)  National Sample Survey (NSS) and Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)
(b)  Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and National Achievement Survey (NAS)
(c)  District Information System for Education (DISE) and Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE)
(d)  National Education Policy (NEP) and Right to Education Act (RTE)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PGI utilizes data from UDISE+ for administrative and infrastructure information and NAS for student achievement data. The other options represent different data sources or policy frameworks. This question tests factual recall regarding the data sources used in a specific government assessment tool.


**9.  Which of the following was NOT a key recommendation of the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee on higher education institution accreditation?**

(a) Transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited).
(b)  Establishment of a National Accreditation Council (NAC) as a meta-accrediting body.
(c)  Retention of the existing eight-point grading system used by NAAC.
(d) Implementation of a Maturity-Based Graded Accreditation system.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Radhakrishnan Committee recommended moving away from the eight-point grading system to a simpler binary system and a maturity-based graded system to encourage continuous improvement.  The establishment of NAC was also a key recommendation. This question tests understanding of the key recommendations of a specific committee report and the changes proposed in higher education accreditation.


**10. The  Global Gender Gap Index, released annually, uses which of the following four parameters for its assessment?**

(a)  Economic Participation, Health and Survival, Political Empowerment, Social Inclusion
(b)  Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, Political Empowerment
(c)  Economic Growth, Social Progress, Environmental Sustainability, Gender Equality
(d)  Income Inequality, Education Levels, Healthcare Access, Political Representation

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Global Gender Gap Index specifically uses the four parameters listed in option (b).  The other options include elements that are either not part of the index or are presented in a different manner.  This question tests precise knowledge of the components of a specific global index.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assesses various cognitive skills.

**1.  A legal framework in India allows for the process where one woman carries and gives birth to a child for an intending couple.  This process, governed by specific regulations and subject to certain conditions, primarily aims to address which of the following aspects?**

(a)  Addressing infertility issues within the context of ethical and legal considerations.
(b)  Providing financial benefits to surrogate mothers while ensuring their well-being.
(c)  Facilitating international surrogacy arrangements for foreign couples.
(d)  Promoting traditional surrogacy methods over gestational surrogacy.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its subsequent amendments primarily aim to regulate surrogacy in India to address infertility while preventing exploitation of surrogate mothers.  Option (b) is incorrect because the act explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, focusing on altruistic surrogacy where compensation is limited to medical expenses. Option (c) is incorrect as the act largely restricts surrogacy to Indian citizens. Option (d) is incorrect as the act predominantly regulates gestational surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is not genetically related to the child. The act emphasizes ethical considerations and legal safeguards for both the intending parents and the surrogate mother, ensuring the process is not exploitative.


**2.  The legal definition of a 'child' in India, particularly within the context of juvenile justice, has implications for the age at which individuals can be held criminally responsible for their actions. Which of the following statements accurately reflects this legal framework?**

(a)  The Juvenile Justice Act (JJ Act) defines a child as anyone under the age of 16, regardless of the severity of the offense.
(b)  The JJ Act allows for the trial of children aged 16-18 as adults only in cases involving petty offenses.
(c)  The JJ Act, as amended, differentiates between heinous and serious offenses when considering the age of criminal responsibility for adolescents.
(d)  The JJ Act completely prohibits the trial of any individual under the age of 18 as an adult.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The JJ Act defines a child as a person below 18 years.  However, a crucial distinction is made between the treatment of adolescents (16-18 years) involved in heinous versus serious or petty offenses.  Heinous offenses, typically those with a minimum punishment of seven years or more imprisonment, can lead to the adolescent being tried as an adult. This reflects a complex legal balancing act between protecting children's rights and addressing the gravity of serious crimes. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the nuanced approach of the JJ Act regarding adolescent offenders.


**3.  Several legal frameworks in India address the issue of child labor, aiming to protect children from exploitative work conditions.  Which of the following correctly identifies a key piece of legislation and its primary focus?**

(a)  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, primarily focuses on eliminating child labor in hazardous industries.
(b)  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, sets a minimum age of 18 for all types of employment.
(c)  The POCSO Act, 2012, is the primary legislation dealing with the rehabilitation of child laborers.
(d)  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all employment.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, explicitly prohibits the employment of children under 14 years of age in any form of work. While other acts address related issues like bonded labor (a) and sexual offenses against children (c), the 2016 amendment directly targets the minimum age of employment. Option (b) is incorrect; the minimum age is 14 for all employment, with further restrictions on adolescents (14-18) in hazardous occupations. The act's focus is on comprehensive prohibition of child labor below a specific age, not just in hazardous industries.


**4.  The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in India plays a crucial role in collecting and analyzing crime data.  Its establishment was primarily based on the recommendations of which committee(s)?**

(a)  The Verma Committee and the Lokur Committee
(b)  The Malimath Committee and the Second ARC
(c) The Tandon Committee and the National Police Commission
(d)  The Sarkaria Committee and the Punchhi Commission


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The foundation of the NCRB is rooted in the recommendations of the Tandon Committee and the National Police Commission. These committees played a significant role in shaping the vision and structure of the NCRB, which focuses on collecting, analyzing, and disseminating crime statistics across India.  The other committees mentioned in the options focused on different aspects of the justice system or governance, not directly on the establishment of a national crime data repository.


**5.  The Vishaka Guidelines, subsequently codified into law, significantly impacted the legal landscape concerning a specific type of workplace harassment.  What is the primary focus of these guidelines and the subsequent legislation?**

(a)  Protection of workers from workplace discrimination based on caste.
(b)  Prevention and redressal of sexual harassment of women at the workplace.
(c)  Ensuring fair wages and working conditions for all employees.
(d)  Combating religious discrimination in employment.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Vishaka Guidelines, and the subsequent Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, directly address the prevention and redressal of sexual harassment of women in the workplace. They established a legal framework for addressing complaints, setting up internal committees, and defining various forms of sexual harassment. The other options are related to workplace rights but do not specifically target sexual harassment.  The Vishaka guidelines were a landmark judgment that significantly shaped legislation and workplace policies to protect women from sexual harassment.


**6.  In India, a specific legal framework aims to protect and rehabilitate individuals engaged in a particular type of degrading and hazardous occupation. This framework primarily addresses which issue?**

(a)  The rehabilitation of child soldiers.
(b)  The protection of bonded laborers.
(c)  The elimination of manual scavenging.
(d)  The prevention of human trafficking.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, specifically targets the elimination of manual scavenging and the rehabilitation of those involved in this hazardous and degrading occupation.  While the other options represent important social issues, this act directly addresses the unique challenges faced by manual scavengers.  The legislation aims to not only prohibit the practice but also provide alternative employment opportunities and support for those affected.


**7.  A significant Supreme Court judgment, *Temple of Healing v. Union of India*, directly addresses the issue of children in need of care and protection. What is the central focus of this judgment?**

(a)  Defining the rights of children in conflict with the law.
(b)  Establishing stricter regulations for child labor.
(c)  Streamlining the process of child adoption for children in childcare institutions.
(d)  Improving the infrastructure of childcare institutions across India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The *Temple of Healing v. Union of India* judgment emphasizes the need to expedite the adoption process for children in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) whose parents are unfit or haven't contacted them for over a year. The judgment aims to facilitate the placement of these children in adoptive families, highlighting the importance of timely intervention.  While the other options touch upon related issues, the core focus of this judgment is on improving the adoption procedures for children in CCIs.  The judgment directs states and union territories to actively identify and register eligible children on the CARINGS portal to expedite the adoption process.


**8.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) in India has undergone a significant revision.  Which of the following best describes a key feature of this revised framework?**

(a)  A complete shift away from multilingualism in education.
(b)  Strict separation of academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level.
(c)  Integration of Indian languages and multilingualism in the curriculum.
(d)  A move towards a rigid, centralized curriculum without regional variations.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The revised NCF-SE strongly emphasizes multilingualism and the integration of Indian languages into the curriculum.  It promotes proficiency in at least three languages, with a focus on Indian languages, reflecting the country's linguistic diversity. Options (a), (b), and (d) contradict the framework's core principles, which prioritize inclusivity, flexibility, and the integration of diverse aspects of Indian culture and knowledge. The framework aims to create a more holistic and inclusive learning environment by promoting the use of local languages and incorporating Indian knowledge systems into the curriculum.


**9.  The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) recently issued guidelines concerning children involved in serious crimes. What is the primary focus of these guidelines?**

(a)  Providing legal representation for all child suspects.
(b)  Determining the appropriate age for criminal responsibility for child offenders.
(c)  Establishing specialized juvenile detention centers across the country.
(d)  Developing a standardized assessment process for child suspects in heinous offenses.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NCPCR guidelines focus on creating a structured and standardized assessment process to evaluate the mental and emotional state of child suspects involved in heinous crimes. This assessment helps determine whether to try them as adults or minors, balancing the need for justice with the rights of the child.  While the other options are related to child rights and justice, the primary focus of these guidelines is on the standardized assessment of child suspects in heinous offenses to ensure that their cases are dealt with fairly. The guidelines aim to provide a consistent method for determining the appropriate course of action for child offenders involved in serious crimes, taking into account their age, mental state, and the nature of the crime committed.


**10.  The  "Prayatna" project, highlighted in a NITI Aayog report, addresses a specific social group’s needs. Which group is the primary beneficiary of this project?**

(a)  Children from marginalized communities.
(b)  Elderly persons facing social isolation.
(c)  Transgender individuals seeking livelihood opportunities.
(d)  Persons with disabilities seeking vocational training.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Prayatna project primarily focuses on providing livelihood and entrepreneurship training to transgender individuals in the Delhi-NCR region.  The project aims to help them improve their quality of life and gain economic independence. While the other options represent important social groups, the Prayatna project's specific target is the transgender community, aiding their socio-economic empowerment. The project is a significant initiative that aims to address the specific challenges and needs of the transgender community in India.  It is an example of a targeted intervention that can contribute to the overall well-being and inclusion of the transgender population.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in education and vulnerable groups.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.


**1.  A government initiative aims to enhance the research capabilities of Indian universities and mitigate gender disparity in science and engineering research funding. Which program best fits this description?**

(a)  National Research Foundation (NRF)
(b)  SERB-POWER
(c)  Fund for Improvement of S&T Infrastructure (FIST)
(d)  Impacting Research Innovation and Technology (IMPRINT) India


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

SERB-POWER (Promoting Opportunities for Women in Exploratory Research) is specifically designed to address the gender imbalance in science and engineering research funding within Indian academic institutions. While the NRF aims to foster R&D broadly, and IMPRINT and FIST support research infrastructure and collaboration, only SERB-POWER directly targets gender disparity in funding.  The other options, while contributing to the overall goal of improving research, lack the specific focus on gender equity that SERB-POWER provides.  Understanding the nuances of each program is crucial for differentiating between the choices.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to analyze the specific objectives of different government schemes.


**2. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) seeks to achieve seamless integration of credits earned through various educational pathways. Which three qualification frameworks does it primarily encompass?**

(a)  National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)
(b)  National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF)
(c)  National Vocational Education Qualification Framework (NVEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)
(d)  National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF),  National Vocational Training Qualification Framework (NVTQF), National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF explicitly aims to integrate the NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF.  Option (a) is incorrect because it substitutes NSEQF with the broader NCF-SE.  Options (c) and (d) introduce frameworks not mentioned in the text as being core components of the NCrF.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the framework's structure. The ability to differentiate between closely related terms like NCF-SE and NSEQF is crucial for accurate interpretation.


**3.  Which organization is responsible for overseeing and supervising an independent ecosystem of accrediting institutions for higher education in India, as envisioned by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020?**

(a) University Grants Commission (UGC)
(b) National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET)
(c)  National Assessment Centre, PARAKH
(d) National Accreditation Council (NAC)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 envisions the NAC as the meta-accrediting body.  The UGC plays a role in recognizing HEIs, but it doesn't have the specific oversight function of the NAC. NABET focuses on school accreditation, and PARAKH is a national assessment center, not an accrediting body. This question tests conceptual understanding of the higher education accreditation system in India and requires knowledge of the organizational roles defined by NEP 2020.  The options are designed to include plausible distractors familiar to those studying Indian education policy.



**4.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI) assesses the performance of the school education system at which levels?**

(a)  National and State levels only
(b)  State and District levels only
(c)  National, State, and Block levels
(d)  National, State, District, and School levels


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the PGI assesses performance at the State and District levels.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include levels of assessment not specified in the provided information.  This question tests factual recall regarding the scope of the PGI. The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as national and school levels, makes the question more challenging.


**5. Which ministry is the nodal ministry for the welfare of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Home Affairs


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for PVTGs. The other options are involved in social welfare but do not have the primary responsibility for PVTGs as defined in the text. This question assesses factual recall concerning the responsibilities of different government ministries.


**6.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum percentage of reservation for PwDs in government jobs. What is that percentage?**

(a) 2%
(b) 3%
(c) 4%
(d) 5%


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Act mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs. This question tests factual recall of a key provision of the RPwD Act. The options are designed to be close enough to create difficulty and prevent simple guessing.


**7.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High level of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) Declining or stagnant population


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

High literacy rates are not a criterion for identifying PVTGs; rather, low literacy is a characteristic.  The other options are all stated criteria. This tests the understanding of the characteristics that define PVTGs and the ability to identify a contrasting characteristic.


**8. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) recently issued guidelines for assessing which category of child suspects under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015?**

(a) Children accused of petty offences
(b) Children accused of serious offences
(c) Children accused of heinous offences
(d) Children accused of white-collar crimes


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The news mentions the NCPCR issuing guidelines specifically for assessing child suspects in heinous offences.  The other options are not the specific focus of the mentioned guidelines. This question tests factual recall about recent developments in juvenile justice.


**9. Which of the following Acts seeks to repeal the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947, and establish a new commission to regulate nursing and midwifery education and training?**

(a) National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019
(b) National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023
(c) National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023
(d)  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NNMC Act, 2023, specifically aims to replace the older Indian Nursing Council Act and establish a more modern regulatory body. This question tests knowledge of recent legislation affecting the healthcare sector.


**10. The  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) is primarily designed to digitally store which type of academic achievements?**

(a) Only undergraduate degrees
(b) Only vocational training certificates
(c) Credits earned from various institutions
(d) Only postgraduate research degrees


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ABC system is designed to store credits earned across different institutions and educational pathways, not limited to a specific level or type of qualification.  This question tests the understanding of the purpose and scope of the ABC system.


**1.  Which statement accurately reflects the highest concentration of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh has the largest absolute number of PVTGs.
(b) Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs.
(c) Chhattisgarh has the highest concentration of PVTGs relative to its overall population.
(d) Arunachal Pradesh has the highest percentage of its population classified as PVTGs.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**
The provided text explicitly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh may have the largest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes (STs), this question specifically asks about PVTGs, a distinct subset within the ST population.  Option (c) is unsupported by the provided data, as no comparative data on PVTG concentration relative to overall population is given for different states.  Similarly, option (d) is incorrect; the text only mentions the state with the highest percentage of ST population (Lakshadweep), not PVTGs. The precise figures for PVTG population percentages in each state are not provided. Therefore, option (b) is the only definitively correct answer based on the given information.


**2. The  Forest Rights Act, 2006, recently granted habitat rights to which of the following PVTGs?**

(a) Chenchus and Konda Reddis
(b) Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga
(c) Hakki Pikki and Kurabas
(d) Pardis and Guzzars


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**
The text clearly states that the Bharia PVTG in Madhya Pradesh and the Kamar and Baiga tribes in Chhattisgarh were recently granted Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. The other options list tribes mentioned in the text but not in connection with recent habitat rights grants under the specified Act.  The Chenchus and Konda Reddis are mentioned as examples of hunter-gatherer and pastoral communities, while the Hakki Pikki and Kurabas are also mentioned as examples of semi-nomadic and pastoral communities.  Pardis and Guzzars are likewise mentioned as pastoral communities.  None of these are explicitly linked to the recent habitat rights grants. Therefore, option (b) is the only correct answer based on the given information.


**3.  Which Ministry is the nodal authority for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes in India?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Home Affairs


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**
The passage explicitly states that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare in India.  The other options, while involved in some aspects of social welfare, do not hold the primary responsibility for Scheduled Tribe welfare as defined in the text. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment addresses broader social justice concerns, including welfare for Scheduled Castes and other marginalized communities. The Ministry of Rural Development focuses on rural development programs, and the Ministry of Home Affairs deals with internal security and law and order. Therefore, only option (c) accurately reflects the nodal ministry for Scheduled Tribe welfare.


**4.  Which of the following accurately describes the categorization of Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in relation to nomadic tribes?**

(a) All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
(b) All DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.
(c) There is no relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes.
(d) DNTs and nomadic tribes are interchangeable terms.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**
The text explicitly states that "All nomadic tribes (NTs) are not DNTs, but all DNTs are NTs." This directly translates to option (b): All DNTs are a subset of nomadic tribes, but the category of nomadic tribes is broader and includes groups that are not DNTs. Option (a) is the direct opposite of the statement in the text. Option (c) contradicts the information given, and option (d) incorrectly implies complete overlap between the two categories. Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes.


**5. According to the Renke Commission (2008), approximately how many nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and Denotified Tribes exist in India, and what is their estimated combined population?**

(a) 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes; 198 DNTs; 15 crore Indians
(b) 500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes; 98 DNTs; 5 crore Indians
(c) 2,000 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes; 250 DNTs; 20 crore Indians
(d) 100 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes; 50 DNTs; 1 crore Indians


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**
The passage directly quotes the Renke Commission (2008) report as stating that there are approximately 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and 198 DNTs, comprising 15 crore (150 million) Indians.  The other options present significantly different figures for both the number of tribes and the total population, none of which match the data provided in the text. Therefore, only option (a) accurately reflects the Renke Commission's findings.



**6. Which of the following Acts repealed the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871?**

(a) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976
(b) The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(c) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012
(d) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**
The text specifically mentions that the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952. The other options are unrelated to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act addresses bonded labor, POCSO Act deals with child sexual offenses, and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act focuses on atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  Therefore, only option (b) provides the correct information regarding the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.


**7. Which day is celebrated annually by DNT communities in India?**

(a) October 2
(b) November 15
(c) August 31
(d) December 10


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**
The text clearly states that August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day in India by DNT communities. The other dates mentioned are not associated with DNT celebrations according to the provided information.  Therefore, only option (c) is correct.


**8. Which of the following schemes is NOT directly aimed at the welfare of Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)?**

(a) Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls
(b) Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme of construction of Hostels for DNTs Boys and Girls
(c) Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(d) Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**
The text lists several schemes specifically designed to improve the educational and economic empowerment of DNTs.  The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, while a significant financial inclusion initiative, is a general scheme not specifically targeted towards DNTs.  The other options directly mention assistance for DNTs through scholarships, hostels, and economic empowerment programs. Therefore, only option (d) is not directly related to the welfare of DNTs as described in the text.


**9.  Which Act defines a "person with benchmark disability"?**

(a) The Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995
(b) The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016
(c) The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation
(d) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**
The text specifies that the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), defines a "person with benchmark disability" as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability. The other Acts listed do not contain this specific definition. The Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995, was superseded by the RPwD Act. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation focuses on sanitation, and the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act addresses manual scavenging. Therefore, only the RPwD Act contains the definition in question.


**10. Which ministry is responsible for the Office of Chief Commissioner of Persons with Disabilities?**

(a) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(c) Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
(d) Ministry of Education


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**
The text explicitly states that the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment is responsible for the Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD.  The other ministries have different areas of focus.  Therefore, only option (c) is correct.


**11.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, makes it an offense to do which of the following?**

(a)  Employ people to clean sewers and septic tanks with appropriate protective gear.
(b)  Demolish insanitary latrines and construct sanitary ones.
(c)  Employ people as manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines.
(d)  Provide training and financial assistance for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**
The text explicitly states that the Act makes it an offense to employ people as manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines.  Option (a) describes a legal and safe practice. Option (b) is a mandated action under the Act to prevent manual scavenging. Option (d) describes a key provision of the Act aimed at rehabilitation.  Therefore, only option (c) accurately describes an offense under the Act.


**12.  Which of the following is NOT a key objective of the National Policy for mechanized Sanitation?**

(a) Eliminate hazardous cleaning practices.
(b) Stop deaths of sewer and septic tank workers.
(c) Ensure the safety and dignity of sanitation workers.
(d)  Promote the construction of insanitary latrines.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**
The text explicitly states that the National Policy for mechanized Sanitation aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning, stop deaths, and ensure safety and dignity of sanitation workers.  The construction of insanitary latrines is explicitly prohibited under related legislation, directly contradicting the policy's objectives. Therefore, only option (d) is incorrect.


**13.  The National Credit Framework (NCF) aims to integrate credits earned through which educational pathways?**

(a) Higher education only
(b) School education and higher education only
(c) School education, higher education, and vocational & skill education
(d) Vocational & skill education only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**
The passage clearly states that the NCF seeks to seamlessly integrate credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational & skill education to ensure flexibility and mobility among them. The other options only partially reflect the NCF's scope.  Therefore, only option (c) is fully accurate.


**14.  Which of the following is NOT a key highlight of the National Credit Framework (NCF)?**

(a) A credit system dividing education into eight levels.
(b) Multiple entry and exit options enabling lifelong learning.
(c)  A focus solely on academic education credits.
(d) Integration of credits earned through various educational pathways.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**
The text emphasizes that the NCF integrates credits from academic education, vocational education, training, and skill education.  Option (c) is incorrect because the NCF explicitly includes non-academic credits. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all key features of the NCF as described in the text.


**15.  The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee's recommendations on higher education accreditation focused primarily on what aspects?**

(a)  Expanding access to higher education without regard for quality.
(b)  Strengthening assessment and accreditation processes and preparing a roadmap for the National Accreditation Council (NAC).
(c)  Reducing the role of accreditation agencies in higher education.
(d)  Maintaining the existing accreditation system without changes.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**
The text clearly states that the committee's mandate included strengthening assessment and accreditation processes and preparing a roadmap for the NAC, as envisioned in the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020. The other options contradict the committee's stated goals.  The focus was on improving, not eliminating, the role of accreditation and creating a roadmap for the future, not maintaining the status quo.


**16.  According to the text, which institution is envisioned as the "meta-accrediting body" in India's higher education system?**

(a) University Grants Commission (UGC)
(b) National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC)
(c) National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET)
(d) National Accreditation Council (NAC)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**
The text explicitly identifies the National Accreditation Council (NAC) as the envisioned "meta-accrediting body," responsible for overseeing and supervising an independent ecosystem of accrediting institutions.  The other options are involved in accreditation but do not hold the overarching role described for the NAC.


**17. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2023 introduced which new subject category?**

(a)  Engineering and Technology
(b)  Management
(c)  Law
(d)  Agriculture & Allied Sectors


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**
The text specifically mentions that the 2023 edition of the NIRF introduced a new subject category: Agriculture & Allied Sectors. The other options are existing categories in the NIRF.


**18. Which organization grants recognition status to individual accrediting agencies that meet its criteria, and what is its abbreviation?**

(a) UGC; University Grants Commission
(b) WFME; World Federation for Medical Education
(c) NMC; National Medical Commission
(d)  UNESCO; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**
The text explicitly states that the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) grants recognition status to accrediting agencies.  The other options are involved in education but do not grant recognition in the manner described.


**19.  The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023, seeks to repeal which Act?**

(a) The Dentists Act, 1948
(b) The Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947
(c) The National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019
(d) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021

(a)  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b)  Ministry of Rural Development
(c)  Ministry of Women and Child Development
(d)  Ministry of Human Resource Development (renamed Ministry of Education)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question targets the nodal ministry overseeing a specific scheme related to Anganwadi services. Option (c) accurately identifies the Ministry of Women and Child Development as the responsible ministry for the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme.  The scheme's focus on nutrition and early childhood care directly falls under the purview of this ministry.  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (a) is involved in health aspects, but the Saksham Anganwadi scheme is primarily a child development and women empowerment initiative. The Ministries of Rural Development (b) and Education (d) have distinct roles and are not primarily responsible for this particular scheme.


**6. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for proficiency in how many languages, with a specific emphasis on Indian languages?**

(a)  One
(b)  Two
(c)  Three
(d)  Four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE's multilingual approach is a key feature.  Option (c) correctly states that the framework promotes proficiency in at least three languages, with a strong emphasis on Indian languages.  The aim is to foster multilingualism and preserve the richness of India's linguistic diversity within the education system. Options (a), (b), and (d) do not accurately reflect the NCF-SE's language policy, which specifically highlights the importance of at least two Indian languages among the three.  This policy reflects a commitment to promoting linguistic diversity and inclusivity in Indian education.

(b)  The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955
(c)  The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d)  The National Commission for Scheduled Castes Act, 1990


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question seeks the specific legislation that overturned the discriminatory Criminal Tribes Act. Option (c) accurately identifies the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, as the act that repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871.  The Criminal Tribes Act unjustly labeled certain communities as "criminal by birth," leading to systemic discrimination. The Habitual Offenders Act aimed to rectify this injustice by repealing the previous discriminatory law.  The other options, while dealing with social justice issues, are not directly connected to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.


**8.  Which high-level committee, established in 2021, played a pivotal role in developing the National Credit Framework (NCrF) in India?**

(a)  The Kasturirangan Committee
(b)  The Radhakrishnan Committee
(c)  A High-Level Committee constituted by the Centre to develop a National Credit Accumulation and Transfer Framework
(d)  The Yashpal Committee

(c)  The Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
(d)  The Department of Science and Technology (DST)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question asks about the specific body integrated into the NRF. Option (c) correctly states that the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, subsumed and repealed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).  The SERB's functions were integrated into the newly established NRF, streamlining research funding and administration.  The ICMR (a), CSIR (b), and DST (d) are significant entities in the scientific research ecosystem, but the NRF Act specifically integrated and replaced the SERB.

(a)  UNICEF
(b)  World Economic Forum
(c)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(d)  International Monetary Fund (IMF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the collaborative authors of a specific report on Universal Health Coverage. Option (c) correctly identifies the World Health Organization (WHO) as the partner with the World Bank in releasing the "Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring Report." The WHO's role in global health initiatives makes it the most likely partner for such a report. UNICEF (a) focuses on children's well-being, the World Economic Forum (b) addresses global economic issues, and the IMF (d) focuses on monetary policy; none of these organizations are mentioned in the provided text as authors of this report.  The report's subject matter directly aligns with the WHO's mandate.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.  Remember that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the individual's knowledge base.


**1.  The Global Food Policy Report 2023, released by a prominent research center, highlighted a significant increase in food insecurity between 2020 and 2022. Which of the following factors is NOT specifically cited in the report as a major contributor to this increase?**

(a) The COVID-19 pandemic
(b) Climate change and natural disasters
(c) Increased global agricultural production
(d) Civil unrest and political instability

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The report explicitly mentions the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change/natural disasters, and civil unrest/political instability as key drivers of the rise in food insecurity.  Increased global agricultural production would generally be expected to *reduce* food insecurity, making (c) the incorrect option. The report focuses on the disruptions to supply chains and access to food, not necessarily on the overall level of food production.  The interplay between production and accessibility is crucial in understanding food security dynamics.  A surplus of food doesn't guarantee food security if it's not accessible to those who need it.  This question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to identify the factor that contradicts the overall trend described in the report.


**2. The UNHCR's 2022 report on forced displacement revealed a concerning trend in global migration. Which statistic from the report BEST reflects the disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations?**

(a)  Around 108.4 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide.
(b) Forced migration due to social and climate crises in 2022 was 21% higher than in 2021.
(c) 30% of forcibly displaced people were children.
(d) 76% of the world’s refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** While all options present data from the UNHCR report, option (c) highlights the vulnerability of children.  The fact that 30% of forcibly displaced individuals are children underscores the disproportionate impact of displacement on this particularly vulnerable group.  Options (a) and (b) present overall numbers and percentage increases, while (d) describes the distribution of refugee hosting, but neither directly addresses the vulnerability of a specific demographic group as sharply as (c).  This question tests factual recall and the ability to analyze data to identify the most impactful statistic.  The high percentage of children among the displaced population points towards the long-term social and developmental consequences of forced migration.


**3. The GANHRI's decision to defer the accreditation of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) highlights concerns about the NHRC's operations. Which of the following is NOT a criticism leveled against the NHRC by GANHRI?**

(a) Political interference in appointments
(b) Inadequate funding for investigations
(c) Poor cooperation with civil society organizations
(d) Involvement of the police in probes into human rights violations

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage specifically mentions political interference in appointments, poor cooperation with civil society, and the involvement of the police in investigations as reasons for GANHRI's concerns.  Inadequate funding is not explicitly cited as a criticism in the provided text. While funding constraints might indirectly affect the NHRC's effectiveness, it's not a direct criticism highlighted by GANHRI in this context. This question tests factual recall and the candidate's ability to distinguish between explicitly stated criticisms and potential inferred issues.  Understanding the specific concerns of GANHRI is crucial to analyzing the challenges faced by the NHRC in upholding human rights standards.


**4. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) plays a crucial advisory role within the UN system.  Which of the following statements accurately describes its composition?**

(a) It consists entirely of government-appointed representatives from indigenous communities.
(b) It's composed solely of independent experts nominated by indigenous organizations.
(c) It comprises an equal number of independent experts nominated by governments and indigenous organizations.
(d) It is comprised of representatives from all UN member states.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the UNPFII has 16 independent experts, with 8 nominated by governments and 8 by indigenous organizations.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they present only one half of the composition. Option (d) is incorrect as the UNPFII is not a body representing all UN member states but rather a smaller group of experts focusing specifically on indigenous issues.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the UNPFII's structure and its representation of both governmental and indigenous perspectives.  The equal representation highlights the UN's commitment to incorporating indigenous voices in policy-making.


**5.  The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs in India is designed to track progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.  Which of the following statements BEST describes the relationship between the NIF and the Global Indicator Framework (GIF)?**

(a) The NIF is a direct replacement for the GIF, superseding it entirely.
(b) The NIF is entirely independent of the GIF and uses completely different indicators.
(c) The NIF aligns with the GIF but also includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs.
(d) The GIF is a subset of the NIF, focusing only on a few selected indicators.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage indicates that the NIF aligns with the GIF's global indicators but also incorporates indicators specific to India's context.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as the NIF builds upon the GIF framework rather than replacing or ignoring it. Option (d) is incorrect; the GIF is not a subset of the NIF, but rather a global framework to which the NIF is aligned. This question assesses conceptual understanding and the ability to grasp the relationship between global and national frameworks for monitoring sustainable development.  The inclusion of India-specific indicators demonstrates the need for context-specific measurement in achieving the SDGs.


**6.  The recently released India Ageing Report 2023, a collaborative effort between UNFPA and IIPS, revealed several key demographic trends. Which of the following is NOT a finding of this report regarding India's population?**

(a) India surpassed China in population size in mid-2023.
(b) A significant portion of India’s population falls within the working-age group (15-64 years).
(c) India's fertility rate is significantly higher than the global average.
(d) India has a growing elderly population (above 65 years).


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The report highlights India's large working-age population, the increasing elderly population, and the surpassing of China in population size.  However, the report indicates that India's fertility rate is decreasing and is currently at or near replacement level (around 2.0), not significantly higher than the global average.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify inconsistencies between the report's findings and the options provided.  The decreasing fertility rate is a significant demographic shift with implications for social security and economic planning.


**7. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 introduced significant reforms in India's education system. Which of the following is NOT a key feature of NEP 2020 related to higher education?**

(a)  Introduction of a multidisciplinary education system.
(b)  Establishment of a National Research Foundation (NRF).
(c)  Mandatory implementation of a single national curriculum across all universities.
(d)  Increased Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) targets.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NEP 2020 promotes multidisciplinary education, sets higher GER targets, and establishes the NRF.  However, it does *not* mandate a single national curriculum for all universities.  The policy aims for greater flexibility and diversity in higher education while maintaining certain national standards.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the NEP 2020's principles and avoids the common misconception of a completely uniform curriculum across all institutions.  The emphasis on flexibility and multidisciplinary approaches is crucial to the NEP's overall vision.


**8.  The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) has focused on achieving Open Defecation Free (ODF) status and moving towards ODF Plus. Which of the following BEST defines an ODF Plus Model village?**

(a) A village that has sustained its ODF status and has arrangements for either solid or liquid waste management.
(b) A village that has achieved ODF status and has minimal litter in public spaces.
(c) A village that has sustained its ODF status, has arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, observes visual cleanliness, and displays ODF Plus IEC messages.
(d) A village that has a functioning community sanitary latrine.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The definition of an ODF Plus Model village, as given in the passage, includes the sustained ODF status, arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and the display of IEC messages.  Options (a) and (b) only partially fulfill the criteria. Option (d) describes a basic requirement for ODF status but does not capture the additional features of ODF Plus Model villages. This question tests the candidate's ability to recall and apply a complex definition. The comprehensive criteria for an ODF Plus Model village highlight the multifaceted nature of sanitation and hygiene.


**9. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, provides several legal remedies for victims of domestic violence. Which of the following is NOT a relief that can be sought under the PWDVA?**

(a)  Protection order restraining the abuser from contacting the victim.
(b)  Compensation for medical expenses incurred due to the abuse.
(c)  Criminal prosecution of the abuser under the Indian Penal Code.
(d)  Custody of children.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PWDVA primarily provides civil remedies. While it can lead to criminal prosecution indirectly (e.g., by providing evidence for other charges), the Act itself does not directly provide for criminal prosecution.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all forms of relief that can be sought under the PWDVA.  This question tests understanding of the PWDVA's limitations and its focus on civil rather than criminal redressal.  The distinction between civil and criminal remedies is crucial in understanding the legal framework for addressing domestic violence.


**10. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) aims to transform school education in India. Which of the following is NOT a key highlight of the NCF-SE?**

(a)  A shift to a 5+3+3+4 age-based curricular structure.
(b)  Increased emphasis on multilingualism and Indian languages.
(c)  A rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects.
(d)  Flexibility and choice at the secondary stage.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE advocates for a flexible, integrated approach to education, emphasizing multilingualism and offering choices at the secondary level.  It explicitly moves away from rigid separations between academic and vocational streams.  This question tests the understanding of the NCF-SE's core principles and its contrast with traditional, compartmentalized educational approaches. The integrated approach reflects a holistic view of education that values diverse learning pathways.


These questions demand in-depth knowledge and analytical skills, aligning with the requirements of a challenging UPSC exam.  Remember that the explanations are provided for clarity and to highlight the key concepts tested; in a real exam setting, only the questions and options would be presented.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and tests various cognitive skills, with detailed explanations provided.


**1.  A national initiative aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, while also reducing mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition rates.  Which program is being described?**

(a) Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b) Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(c) Anganwadi Services Scheme (now Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0)
(d) National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, directly addresses the nutritional and health needs of the specified population groups, aiming to reduce mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on broader health coverage, while Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets immunization.  POSHAN Abhiyan, while related to nutrition, operates as a supervisory and monitoring mission rather than a direct service provider like the Anganwadi system. The Anganwadi system is a vast network of centers reaching over 8 crore children daily, making it the most comprehensive program directly impacting this demographic.  The other options have related goals but do not match the comprehensive scope of the Anganwadi system's objectives.


**2.  Which of the following initiatives utilizes technology to improve equitable access to quality healthcare, including telemedicine and national portability of health services?**

(a) National Health Policy 2017
(b) Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(c) Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)
(d) Intensified Mission Indradhanush


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) explicitly leverages technology, such as telemedicine, to enhance access to healthcare services and facilitate national portability.  While Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims for universal health coverage, it doesn't inherently focus on digital technology in the same way. The National Health Policy 2017 sets overall goals, and Intensified Mission Indradhanush concentrates on immunization, neither of which emphasizes technological solutions for access and portability as the core of their design.  The ABDM's unique contribution is its direct use of digital infrastructure to bridge geographical and administrative barriers in accessing healthcare.


**3.  A study by the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, indicated a significant increase in overall enrollment in several cities after the introduction of a particular technological advancement in educational institutions. This technology was implemented under which national scheme?**

(a) Saksham Anganwadis
(b) Smart Cities Mission
(c) National Nutrition Mission
(d) Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The study directly links the increase in enrollment to the introduction of smart classrooms, a key element of the Smart Cities Mission.  Saksham Anganwadis focus on upgrading Anganwadi centers, the National Nutrition Mission on improving nutrition, and the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission on digital health infrastructure. These initiatives are not directly related to the observed increase in school enrollment stemming from improved classroom technology. The Smart Cities Mission's investment in infrastructure, including smart classrooms, directly impacted educational access and participation, as evidenced by the IIM Bangalore study.


**4.  The World Health Organization (WHO) published a report highlighting the significant global health burden attributable to inadequate access to essential services. Which collective term encompasses these services, focusing on water, sanitation, and hygiene?**

(a)  National Family Health Survey (NFHS) indicators
(b)  Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being)
(c)  WASH
(d)  Triple Threat Report indicators


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) is the established term used to represent the interconnected aspects of access to safe water, improved sanitation, and maintaining basic hygiene. While the NFHS does include health indicators related to sanitation, it is not a collective term for these services themselves. SDG 3 is a broader goal encompassing many health aspects, and the Triple Threat Report focuses on a specific set of WASH-related risks for children, but neither is the overarching term for the services themselves. The WHO report directly refers to WASH as the collective term for the services.


**5.  A report, released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, provides an assessment of global hunger levels and ranks several countries based on their performance.  What is the name of this report?**

(a)  State of World Population Report
(b)  Global Food Policy Report
(c)  Global Hunger Index (GHI)
(d)  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is precisely the report released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, providing an annual assessment of hunger levels globally and ranking countries accordingly. The State of World Population Report focuses on demographic trends. The Global Food Policy Report analyzes food policy issues, and the SDG Progress Report tracks progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. While related to the issue of hunger, these reports do not provide the specific ranking and assessment of hunger levels that the GHI focuses on. The GHI is a widely recognized metric for assessing progress in reducing hunger.


**6.  In India, a particular initiative aims to reduce stunting in districts with high malnutrition burdens by improving the utilization of key services provided through a specific grassroots-level community health worker program. Which mission is primarily responsible for this initiative?**

(a) National Rural Health Mission
(b) National Health Policy 2017
(c) National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan
(d) Intensified Mission Indradhanush


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan directly targets malnutrition reduction, including stunting, by improving the effectiveness of Anganwadi services. The National Rural Health Mission focuses on broader rural health, the National Health Policy 2017 sets overarching health goals, and Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on immunization.  Although other missions contribute to improved nutrition indirectly, the POSHAN Abhiyan is specifically designed to tackle malnutrition at the grassroots level by optimizing the use of Anganwadi services – the primary service delivery mechanism for early childhood care and nutrition in the target districts.


**7.  What is the primary objective of the Saksham Anganwadis initiative?**

(a)  Improve the digital literacy of Anganwadi workers.
(b)  Strengthen, upgrade, and rejuvenate Anganwadi centers across India.
(c)  Provide insurance coverage to Anganwadi workers and helpers.
(d)  Increase the honorarium paid to Anganwadi workers.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  While Saksham Anganwadis includes elements of digital strengthening, insurance coverage, and increased honorarium, its core objective is the comprehensive strengthening, upgrading, and rejuvenation of Anganwadi centers nationwide to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The other options represent components of the initiative but not its primary, overarching goal. The program's aim is to improve the overall quality and capacity of Anganwadi centers to better serve their target populations.


**8.  Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023, focusing on the demographic trends of India’s aging population?**

(a) UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b) UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(c) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d) World Food Programme (WFP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), released the India Ageing Report 2023. The other organizations mentioned have different mandates and do not focus specifically on aging populations in India. The UNFPA's focus on reproductive health and population dynamics aligns directly with the report's subject matter.  This collaboration highlights the UNFPA's role in demographic research and analysis.


**9.  Which organization's report, titled “Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report,” details the number of people forcibly displaced worldwide due to conflict, persecution, and other factors?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(c) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the organization responsible for the report on global forced displacement.  The other organizations listed focus on food security, food policy, and human rights institutions respectively, which are not the primary subjects of this specific report. The UNHCR's mandate and expertise in refugee protection and assistance directly relate to the content of the report.  The report's findings are crucial for understanding the global refugee crisis.


**10.  The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is primarily developed and maintained by which Indian Ministry?**

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(c) Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)
(d) Ministry of Women and Child Development


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is the primary agency responsible for developing and maintaining the NIF for SDGs in India. While other ministries contribute data and are involved in implementing the SDGs, MoSPI plays the central role in indicator framework creation and progress reporting.  MoSPI's role highlights the importance of data collection and analysis in tracking progress towards the SDGs.

IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it operates in over 60 countries, including India. Its core mandate aligns perfectly with the description provided: providing research-based policy solutions to reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they represent different organizations with distinct mandates and focuses, not directly related to agricultural research and food security in the manner described.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding.


**2.  A 1950 UN General Assembly creation, headquartered in Geneva, operates in 137 countries, including India.  Its mission is to protect the rights of and build a better future for individuals forced from their homes due to conflict and persecution.  This organization is guided by a 1951 convention and its 1967 protocol, which are fundamental to its operations. What is the name of this organization?**

(a)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(b)  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(c)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question accurately describes the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The text clearly indicates its establishment date (1950), headquarters (Geneva), operational reach (137 countries including India), and core mission of protecting refugees and building a better future for those forced to flee their homes.  The mention of the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol further solidifies the identity of the organization. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect, as they represent organizations concerned with human rights, indigenous issues, and children's rights, respectively—distinct from UNHCR's focus on refugees and asylum seekers. The question assesses factual recall and conceptual understanding of international organizations.


**3.  This organization, established in 1993, is headquartered in Geneva and comprises 120 National Human Rights Institutions, including India's NHRC.  It reviews and accredits National Human Rights Institutions based on the Paris Principles, adopted in 1993 by the UN General Assembly.  This organization recently deferred the accreditation of a specific National Human Rights Commission due to concerns about political interference and lack of cooperation with civil society. Which organization is this?**

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(c)  UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(d)  World Food Programme (WFP)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description points directly to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI). The provided text details GANHRI's establishment year (1993), headquarters (Geneva), membership (120 National Human Rights Institutions, including India's NHRC), and its role in reviewing and accrediting NHRIs according to the Paris Principles. The mention of the deferred accreditation of the NHRC further strengthens the identification. The other options are incorrect; they are involved in different areas, such as economic and social affairs, population development, and food security, respectively. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the roles of international organizations in monitoring human rights standards.


**4. The 2023 Global Food Policy Report, emphasizing a rethinking of food crisis responses, was released by which organization?**

(b)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(c)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(d)  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The question directly asks about the source of a specific report. The text explicitly names the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) as the organization that released the 2023 Global Food Policy Report.  The other options are involved in different areas, making them unsuitable answers. This question focuses on factual recall.

(d)  UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question tests factual recall. The text explicitly states that the UNDESA released the SDG Progress Report 2023: Special Edition.  The other options are incorrect because their work focuses on different areas.


**7. The Paris Principles, which provide standards for National Human Rights Institutions globally, were adopted by which body?**

(a)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(b)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(c)  UN General Assembly
(d)  UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question assesses knowledge of the origin of the Paris Principles. The text states that the UN General Assembly adopted the Paris Principles in 1993.  While GANHRI uses the Paris Principles, it did not adopt them.


**8. Which organization is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by its State parties?**

(a)  UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(b)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(c)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)

(a)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(b)  UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(c)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d)  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question requires careful consideration of each organization's primary focus.  While UNDESA has a broad mandate including aspects of population, UNHCR primarily deals with refugees, not population dynamics in the same way as the other options.  This question tests conceptual understanding and discrimination between related concepts.

These MCQs aim for a higher difficulty level by requiring precise knowledge and the ability to differentiate between closely related organizations and their functions, aligning with UPSC exam standards.  The explanations provide ample context and analysis for each correct and incorrect option.


**MCQs from Source Content:**

1. **Which of the following statements regarding the New Development Bank (NDB) is/are accurate?**

(a) Its membership is exclusively limited to BRICS nations.
(b) The initial subscribed capital was $50 billion, equally contributed by founding members.
(c) It primarily focuses on projects in developed countries.
(d)  It is headquartered in Shanghai, China.


**Correct Answer:** (b) and (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The NDB did indeed start with an initial subscribed capital of $50 billion, equally shared among its five founding members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).  However, the bank's membership has expanded beyond the BRICS nations, making option (a) incorrect. Option (c) is also incorrect; the NDB's primary focus is on infrastructure and sustainable development projects in emerging economies and developing countries.  Option (d) is correct, as the NDB is headquartered in Shanghai, China. The bank aims to supplement existing financial institutions and provide an alternative source of funding for infrastructure projects in member countries and other developing nations.  Its operational framework is designed to promote sustainable development and economic growth while adhering to international best practices in financial management and governance.


2. **Concerning the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), which statement(s) is/are true?**

(a) The framework is structured around five pillars: Trade, Supply Chain Resilience, Clean Economy, Fair Economy, and Digital Economy.
(b) Australia and New Zealand are not members of the IPEF.
(c) The IPEF aims to create a comprehensive free trade agreement among its members.
(d) The IPEF is primarily focused on strengthening economic ties among participating nations without necessarily creating a traditional free trade agreement.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. The IPEF is designed to enhance economic cooperation among its members through several pillars, including those mentioned in option (a), but it's not a traditional free trade agreement (FTA).  Option (a) is partially incorrect: although the IPEF has four main pillars (Trade, Supply Chain Resilience, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy), it is important to note that the Digital Economy is not a formal pillar but rather a cross-cutting theme integrated across all four pillars. Australia and New Zealand are members of the IPEF, making option (b) incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect because the IPEF does not aim to create a comprehensive FTA; instead, it focuses on a broader range of economic cooperation initiatives. The IPEF's approach emphasizes practical collaborations and mutually beneficial initiatives to address shared economic challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.  The framework adopts a flexible and inclusive approach, allowing countries to participate in the pillars that align with their national interests and capabilities.


3. **Which organizations jointly launched the International Advisory Body for Submarine Cable Resilience?**

(a) International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC)
(b) International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO)
(c) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and International Energy Agency (IEA)
(d) World Economic Forum (WEF) and the International Data Corporation (IDC)


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) are the organizations that jointly launched the International Advisory Body for Submarine Cable Resilience.  This collaboration reflects the shared interest of these organizations in ensuring the security and reliability of undersea communication cables, which are critical for global connectivity and data transmission.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect; these organizations do not have a direct, primary role in the launch or oversight of this specific advisory body. The collaboration between the ITU and the ICPC is essential because the ITU focuses on the telecommunications aspects of submarine cables, while the ICPC focuses on their physical protection and security. The joint initiative aims to enhance coordination and cooperation among stakeholders to mitigate risks and improve the resilience of submarine cable infrastructure.


4. **Identify the accurate statement(s) concerning the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).**

(a) It was adopted in 1994 as the sole legally binding international agreement to address desertification.
(b) The UNCCD's main goal is to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030.
(c) India hosted the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNCCD.
(d)  The UNCCD focuses solely on arid and semi-arid lands.


**Correct Answer:** (a) and (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The UNCCD, adopted in 1994, is indeed a legally binding international agreement specifically focused on combating desertification and mitigating the effects of drought. Option (b) is also correct.  Land degradation neutrality, the goal of preventing further land degradation and restoring already degraded lands, is a central objective of the UNCCD.  Option (c) is incorrect; while India is a signatory to the UNCCD and actively participates in its processes, it hasn't hosted all sessions of the Conference of the Parties (COP). Option (d) is incorrect; while desertification is a key concern, the UNCCD's scope extends to various forms of land degradation beyond arid and semi-arid lands. The UNCCD promotes sustainable land management practices, international cooperation, and technological advancements to combat desertification and land degradation across different geographical regions and environmental contexts.



5. **Which statement about the African Union (AU) is NOT correct?**

(b) The AU's headquarters are located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
(c) It aims to promote peace, security, and stability in Africa.
(d) It comprises 55 member states, representing all the countries in Africa.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is incorrect. While the AU aims to encompass all African nations, its membership currently stands at 55 member states.  Although this is a significant number, there are a few territories and entities that are not currently members of the AU.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all correct statements about the AU. The AU is the primary intergovernmental organization of the African continent, aiming to promote unity, cooperation, and development among its member states. Its activities cover a wide range of areas, including political cooperation, economic integration, social development, peace and security, and cultural promotion. The AU serves as a crucial platform for addressing regional challenges and fostering cooperation on matters of mutual concern.



6. **Regarding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which statement(s) is/are correct?**

(a) Established in 1949, it operates on the principle of collective defense.
(b) Its headquarters are located in Vienna, Austria.
(c) NATO's primary focus is on maintaining peace and security within Europe only.
(d) NATO's membership is open to any country that meets its criteria.


**Correct Answer:** (a) and (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. NATO, formed in 1949, is founded on the principle of collective defense, meaning that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Option (b) is incorrect. NATO's headquarters are located in Brussels, Belgium, not Vienna, Austria. Option (c) is incorrect; while NATO's primary focus is on Euro-Atlantic security, its reach and concerns extend beyond Europe.  Option (d) is correct; while it has specific criteria for membership, NATO's membership is open to countries that can fulfill the required political, military, and economic commitments. The organization's role has evolved over time, adapting to changing geopolitical circumstances and expanding its focus to include counterterrorism, cyber security, and other emerging threats.


**UPSC Style MCQs on Social Issues from Target Content:**

1.  **A national initiative aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  Which program is being described?**

(a)  National Rural Health Mission
(b)  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(c)  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme is a flagship program of the Indian government focused on improving the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  It provides a comprehensive package of services, including supplementary nutrition, immunization, health check-ups, and early childhood education.  While the other options (National Rural Health Mission, Ayushman Bharat Yojana, and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) address various aspects of healthcare, they do not have the specific focus on the early childhood development and maternal health that characterizes the ICDS.  The ICDS scheme is implemented through a network of Anganwadi Centers (AWCs), which serve as the primary points of contact for beneficiaries.  The program's success depends on effective community participation, strong monitoring mechanisms, and regular evaluation of its outcomes.


2.  **Which index, released by the United Nations Development Programme, aims to understand the systemic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women globally, using four dimensions including Political, Educational, Economic, and Physical Integrity?**

(a)  Global Gender Gap Index
(b)  Gender Social Norms Index
(c)  Women’s Empowerment Index
(d)  Global Gender Parity Index


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI) is a key initiative of the UNDP designed to measure and analyze the social norms that contribute to gender inequality and discrimination worldwide. The GSNI uses a multidimensional framework to assess the extent to which societal norms restrict women's opportunities and limit their capabilities in various aspects of life.  The index considers four key dimensions: political empowerment, educational attainment, economic participation, and physical integrity. The GSNI's findings provide valuable insights into the root causes of gender inequality, allowing policymakers and other stakeholders to develop targeted interventions to address these issues effectively. The other options, while related to gender equality, do not specifically focus on the measurement of social norms that perpetuate gender inequality.


3.  **The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 primarily addresses which social issue in India?**

(a)  Child labor
(b)  Caste-based discrimination
(c)  Manual scavenging
(d)  Gender inequality


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, directly targets the issue of manual scavenging. This act aims to eradicate the practice of manual scavenging, which involves the removal of human excreta by hand from insanitary latrines, sewers, and septic tanks.  The act criminalizes the employment of manual scavengers and mandates the construction of sanitary latrines to eliminate the need for this hazardous and dehumanizing practice.  While the other options (child labor, caste-based discrimination, and gender inequality) are significant social problems in India, they are not the primary focus of this specific legislation. The act also includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, providing them with alternative employment opportunities and financial assistance.  The implementation of this act requires a multi-pronged approach, involving strong enforcement mechanisms, community awareness campaigns, and sustained efforts to improve sanitation infrastructure.


4.  **Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)?**

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) collaborated with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) to release the India Ageing Report 2023. This report provides comprehensive data and analysis on the demographic trends related to the aging population in India.  The UNFPA is a specialized agency of the United Nations focused on population issues, including reproductive health, gender equality, and population dynamics.  The collaboration with IIPS, a leading research institution in India, ensured the report's relevance and accuracy within the Indian context. The other organizations listed—UNDESA, WFP, and IFPRI—focus on broader development issues and do not have the specific mandate or expertise in population aging that characterizes the UNFPA's work.  The report's findings are crucial for policymakers to understand the implications of an aging population and to develop appropriate policies and programs to address the challenges and opportunities this demographic shift presents.


5. **The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), released by the Ministry of Education, is primarily aligned with which overarching policy document?**

(a)  National Policy on Education, 1986
(b)  National Education Policy, 2020
(c)  National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) framework
(d)  Right to Education Act, 2009

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) is directly aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.  The NEP 2020 provided a comprehensive framework for reforming the Indian education system, encompassing various aspects from early childhood care and education to higher education. The NCF-SE was developed to translate the NEP 2020's vision into a practical curriculum framework for school education.  Options (a), (c), and (d), while significant in the Indian education landscape, are not the primary policy document guiding the NCF-SE.  The NEP 2020's key recommendations, such as the 5+3+3+4 curricular structure, the emphasis on holistic development, and the promotion of multilingualism, are all reflected in the NCF-SE.  The NCF-SE's implementation is expected to bring significant changes to the school curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment practices across the country.


6.  **Which Act, amended in 2021, allows for the termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks under certain specific conditions?**

(a)  The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956
(b)  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c)  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(d)  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, was amended in 2021 to expand access to safe and legal abortion services for women. The amendment increased the gestational limit for abortion from 20 weeks to 24 weeks under certain specific circumstances, such as rape, incest, or risk to the woman's life or health.  The other options are unrelated to abortion laws.  The amendment aimed to improve women's reproductive health rights and to reduce unsafe abortions, which are a significant cause of maternal mortality in India.  The implementation of the amended MTP Act requires effective sensitization of healthcare providers, awareness among women about their rights, and accessible healthcare facilities to ensure that the provisions of the act are implemented equitably.


7.  **The  "Poshan Tracker," a mobile-based application, is primarily used to monitor and track which aspects of a national program?**

(a)  The progress of Skill India initiatives
(b)  The implementation of the National Health Mission
(c)  Nutrition service delivery under the POSHAN Abhiyaan
(d)  The effectiveness of the National Rural Livelihoods Mission


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Poshan Tracker" is a mobile application used to monitor and track nutrition service delivery under the POSHAN Abhiyaan (National Nutrition Mission). This application helps Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) to efficiently track the nutritional status of children and pregnant women and monitor the delivery of nutrition services.  The other options are incorrect; the Poshan Tracker is not directly related to Skill India, the National Health Mission, or the National Rural Livelihoods Mission.  The app is a key component of the POSHAN Abhiyaan's strategy to improve nutrition outcomes through improved data collection, monitoring, and targeted interventions.  The app's features include real-time data entry, data analysis, and reporting, facilitating better decision-making and resource allocation at all levels.


8.  **Which report, jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP, introduced twin indices to measure women's empowerment and gender equality globally, including a Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) and a Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI)?**

(a)  The Global Hunger Index
(b)  The Human Development Report
(c)  The Path to Equal Report
(d)  The Sustainable Development Goals Report


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Path to Equal" report, a joint initiative of UN Women and UNDP, introduced two key indices—the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI)—to comprehensively assess women's empowerment and gender equality across countries.  The WEI focuses specifically on women's capabilities and agency, while the GGPI measures gender gaps across various dimensions of human development.  The other options are related to different development indicators and do not contain these specific indices. The "Path to Equal" report provides a comprehensive analysis of gender inequality and empowers policymakers and other stakeholders to design effective interventions to promote gender equality and women's empowerment globally. The report's findings highlight the persistent gender gaps in various areas and underscore the need for urgent and concerted action to achieve gender equality.



**1.  Which entity is responsible for recognizing Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India and what criteria are used for this recognition?**

(a) The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, based on socio-economic indicators.
(b) The National Commission for Scheduled Castes, based on historical oppression and social exclusion.
(c) The Ministry of Tribal Affairs, based on pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
(d) The National Human Rights Commission, based on vulnerability to human rights violations.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for recognizing and addressing the needs of PVTGs in India. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are specifically outlined and include a pre-agricultural level of technology, low literacy rates, significant economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  These criteria reflect the unique vulnerabilities and challenges faced by these groups, differentiating them from other Scheduled Tribes. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they cite the wrong agencies and criteria. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment focuses on broader social justice issues, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes deals with Scheduled Castes, and the National Human Rights Commission addresses human rights violations, not specifically the criteria for recognizing PVTGs.  The specific criteria used by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs are crucial in understanding the unique challenges faced by PVTGs and the rationale behind their special categorization.


**2.  Which Indian state has the highest number of recognized Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Jharkhand

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Odisha currently houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh also have a significant number of PVTGs, including some shared groups like the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes, Odisha surpasses them in the overall count. Jharkhand, while having a substantial tribal population, does not have as many PVTGs as Odisha. This fact highlights the diverse distribution of PVTGs across India and the concentration of particularly vulnerable groups in specific states.  Understanding the geographical distribution of PVTGs is important for targeted policy interventions and resource allocation.


**3.  Which legal instrument governs the process of identifying and rehabilitating manual scavengers in India, and what is a key provision within this instrument?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, which mandates stringent punishment for perpetrators of violence against manual scavengers.
(b) The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, which aims to provide employment opportunities to manual scavengers as a means of rehabilitation.
(c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, which bans manual scavenging and outlines procedures for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.
(d) The Right to Information Act, 2005, which empowers citizens to access information about the government's efforts to eradicate manual scavenging.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, is the primary legal framework addressing manual scavenging in India.  It explicitly prohibits the employment of individuals in this hazardous occupation and lays down a comprehensive process for their rehabilitation.  This includes provisions for alternative employment, financial assistance, and help with property acquisition.  The Act's key provision is the complete ban on manual scavenging, making it a criminal offense.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they address different aspects of social justice and governance, but not the specific legal instrument dedicated to the eradication of manual scavenging and the rehabilitation of those affected.  Understanding the key provisions of this Act is crucial in analyzing the government's approach to addressing this social issue.


**4.  Which government body is tasked with preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in India?**

(a) The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes
(b) The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes
(c) The National Human Rights Commission
(d) The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is specifically mandated to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes (DNTs). This task reflects the commission's role in identifying and addressing the unique challenges faced by these marginalized communities.  The other options, while involved in social justice and human rights issues, do not have this specific responsibility. The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes focuses on Scheduled Tribes, the National Human Rights Commission addresses broader human rights issues, and the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has a wider mandate than compiling a specific caste list for DNTs.  The NCDNT's role in creating this state-wise list is critical for targeted policy interventions and resource allocation for DNT communities.


**5.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation percentage for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in which sector(s)?**

(a)  Only in government jobs.
(b) Only in government-aided higher educational institutions.
(c)  In both government jobs and government-aided higher educational institutions.
(d) In private sector jobs and private higher educational institutions.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation of not less than 4% for PwDs in government jobs and not less than 5% in government-aided higher educational institutions.  This demonstrates a commitment to inclusive employment and education for PwDs.  The Act does not mandate reservations in the private sector, hence option (d) is incorrect. Options (a) and (b) are partially correct but incomplete, as the act covers both sectors.  The specific reservation percentages mandated in the Act highlight the government's aim to promote inclusivity and equal opportunities for PwDs in key sectors of society.


**6.  Which organization released the India Ageing Report 2023, and what is a key focus area of this organization's mandate?**

(a) The World Bank, focusing on economic development and poverty reduction.
(b) The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), focusing on sexual and reproductive health and rights.
(c) The International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), focusing on demographic research and analysis.
(d) The World Health Organization (WHO), focusing on global health issues and disease control.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).  A key focus area of UNFPA's mandate is ensuring sexual and reproductive health and rights for all, especially women and young people. While the report addresses aging, UNFPA's broader mandate encompasses the life cycle, and aging is a key demographic factor influencing reproductive health and rights.  The World Bank, IIPS, and WHO, while involved in related areas, do not have the same primary focus on sexual and reproductive health and rights that is central to UNFPA's work. The UNFPA's role in releasing this report highlights the intersection of demographic trends and sexual and reproductive health.


**7.  Which international organization's report, "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022," highlights the global scale of forced displacement and its impact on vulnerable populations?**

(a) The International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b) The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  The World Bank
(d) The International Labour Organization (ILO)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) released the report "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022."  This report is a key source of data and analysis on the global scale of forced displacement due to conflict, persecution, and other factors. UNHCR's mandate is specifically focused on protecting refugees and other forcibly displaced people.  The IOM, World Bank, and ILO, while involved in migration, development, and labor issues respectively, do not have the same central focus on refugee protection that defines UNHCR's work and the scope of this particular report.  The UNHCR's report is a critical resource for understanding the humanitarian challenges posed by forced displacement.


**8. Which organization is responsible for accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), and what are the key principles guiding this accreditation process?**

(a) The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
(b) The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), guided by the Paris Principles.
(c) Amnesty International, guided by its own human rights standards.
(d) Human Rights Watch, guided by its own research and advocacy priorities.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is responsible for reviewing and accrediting NHRIs.  The Paris Principles, adopted in 1993, are the key standards guiding this accreditation process.  These principles outline the criteria for NHRIs to be considered independent, autonomous, and effective in promoting and protecting human rights.  The UNHRC, while central to international human rights, does not directly accredit NHRIs.  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are prominent NGOs involved in human rights advocacy, but they are not involved in the formal accreditation process.  GANHRI's role in accrediting NHRIs based on the Paris Principles is crucial for ensuring the quality and effectiveness of human rights protection mechanisms globally.


**9. Which Ministry is responsible for the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme in India?**

(a) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(d) Ministry of Education

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) is responsible for the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme in India.  This scheme aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. The other options are incorrect as they do not have the primary responsibility for this particular scheme. The MoWCD's leadership in this area reflects the importance given to early childhood care and nutrition within India's development priorities.


**10. Which two organizations jointly released the 2023 Global Monitoring report on Universal Health Coverage (UHC)?**

(a) The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF
(b) The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank
(c) UNICEF and the World Bank
(d) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank jointly released the 2023 Global Monitoring report on Universal Health Coverage (UHC). This report tracks progress towards achieving UHC globally and provides data and analysis on various health indicators.  The other options are incorrect as they do not represent the correct partnership for this specific report.  The collaborative effort of WHO and the World Bank highlights the importance of a multi-sectoral approach to achieving UHC, encompassing both health systems strengthening and broader development goals.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to the specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1.  Consider a group designated as particularly vulnerable due to pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. Which of the following best describes this group's official categorization in India?**

(a)  De-notified Tribes (DNTs)
(b)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs)
(c)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(d)  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The description precisely matches the criteria used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India.  These groups are recognized by the central government as requiring special attention due to their extreme vulnerability.  Options (a), (b), and (c) represent other categories of marginalized communities in India, but they do not specifically fit the provided description. DNTs face distinct socio-economic challenges, while OBCs and SCs are broader classifications based on different criteria. The unique combination of factors – pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and population decline – directly points to PVTGs.  Understanding the nuanced distinctions between these groups is crucial for effective policymaking and social justice initiatives.


**2.  The NHRC recently advocated for the implementation of a report recommending a permanent commission for a specific group of Indian communities.  These communities were historically labeled "born criminal" under British rule. Which of the following groups is this?**

(a)  Scheduled Tribes (STs)
(b)  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(c)  De-notified Tribes (DNTs)
(d)  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NTs)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the De-notified Tribes (DNTs), who were wrongly categorized as "criminal tribes" during British colonial rule. The National Human Rights Commission's (NHRC) push for a permanent commission highlights the ongoing need to address the historical injustices and discrimination faced by this vulnerable group. While all DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, not all nomadic groups are DNTs.  Scheduled Tribes and Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups are distinct categories with different criteria for inclusion, making options (a) and (b) incorrect.  Option (d) is too broad; the NHRC's focus is specifically on the communities historically labeled as criminal tribes, which aligns directly with the DNTs.


**3.  A semi-nomadic tribal group from Karnataka, known for their traditional occupations, provides an example of which broader categorization of marginalized communities in India?**

(a)  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(b)  De-notified Tribes (DNTs)
(c)  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NTs)
(d)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Hakki Pikki tribe, mentioned as a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka, exemplifies the Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NTs) in India. Their lifestyle and traditional occupations highlight the unique challenges faced by this category of marginalized communities.  While some NTs might overlap with PVTGs or DNTs, the Hakki Pikki’s description doesn't explicitly align with the specific criteria for those classifications. Scheduled Castes are a separate category based on social hierarchy and historical discrimination. Therefore, option (c) accurately captures the broader categorization to which the Hakki Pikki tribe belongs, emphasizing the significance of understanding the diversity within India’s marginalized communities and their unique needs.


**4.  The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India is found in which state?**

(a)  Madhya Pradesh
(b)  Chhattisgarh
(c)  Andaman and Nicobar Islands
(d)  Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India, reflecting the unique geographical and socio-economic factors influencing the distribution of these extremely vulnerable communities.  While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes overall, the question specifically asks about the concentration of PVTGs. Chhattisgarh also has a significant number of PVTGs, but it does not surpass Odisha’s count. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands possess a significant tribal population, but the number of PVTGs is lower than that of Odisha.  This question tests knowledge of specific geographical distribution of vulnerable groups, a crucial aspect of understanding India’s social diversity and the targeted implementation of welfare programs.


**5. Which of the following Acts aims to prevent the practice of removing human excreta by hand, and what is the penalty for its violation?**

(a)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989; Imprisonment up to 5 years or fine up to Rs. 5 lakh, or both.
(b)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013; Imprisonment up to 2 years or fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both.
(c)  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993; Imprisonment and/or a fine.
(d)  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976; Imprisonment and/or a fine.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, specifically targets the practice of manual scavenging and outlines penalties for its violation.  The act aims to eliminate this degrading practice and rehabilitate those affected. Option (a) addresses atrocities against scheduled castes and tribes, a separate but related issue. Option (c) is a broader human rights act, and option (d) addresses bonded labor, another form of exploitation.  The specific penalty mentioned in option (b)—imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both—directly reflects the provisions of the relevant Act.  This question highlights the importance of understanding specific legislation related to social justice issues in India and their consequences.



**6.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum percentage of reservation in government jobs for individuals with benchmark disabilities. What is this percentage?**

(a) 2%
(b) 3%
(c) 4%
(d) 5%

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs for individuals with benchmark disabilities. This reflects a commitment to inclusive employment practices and social inclusion.  While there is also a reservation in higher educational institutions, the question specifically targets government jobs.  The other options represent incorrect percentages, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge of legal provisions related to disability rights in India.  The correct answer emphasizes the legal framework aimed at promoting equal opportunities for people with disabilities in the Indian workforce.


**7.  Which Ministry is the nodal ministry for the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN)?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Panchayati Raj

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for implementing the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN), a significant initiative aimed at improving the lives of particularly vulnerable tribal groups. While other ministries contribute to the program's various components, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides overall leadership and coordination.  The other options are involved in related social welfare programs but are not the designated nodal ministry for PM JANMAN.  This question assesses knowledge of governmental organizational structure and its role in social welfare programs.


**8.  The  "Panchsheel Principles" are a set of guiding principles for the development of which specific group in India?**

(a) Scheduled Castes
(b)  De-notified Tribes
(c)  Nomadic and Semi-nomadic Tribes
(d) Tribal Communities

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Panchsheel Principles are guiding principles for the development of tribal communities in India. These principles emphasize respecting tribal traditions, autonomy, and rights.  The principles are not specifically directed towards other marginalized groups. This question tests knowledge of policy frameworks related to tribal development and the importance of respecting indigenous cultures and practices.  The correct answer underscores the government’s commitment to inclusive development policies tailored to the unique needs of tribal communities.


**9. In which state is the Bharia PVTG found?**

(a) Odisha
(b) Andhra Pradesh
(c) Madhya Pradesh
(d) Karnataka

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Bharia tribe is listed as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Madhya Pradesh.  This question tests knowledge of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups within India.  The other options represent states with significant tribal populations but do not include the Bharia PVTG.  Accurate identification of the location of specific tribal groups is important for understanding the targeted implementation of welfare and development programs.


**10. Which of the following is NOT a criterion used for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High level of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) A declining or stagnant population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** A high level of literacy is NOT a criterion for identifying PVTGs. In fact, low literacy is a key characteristic of these groups. This question tests the understanding of the specific criteria used for identifying PVTGs and highlights the challenges faced by these extremely vulnerable groups.  The other options accurately reflect criteria used to determine PVTG status.  The correct answer underscores the importance of understanding the specific vulnerabilities of PVTGs to effectively address their needs.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assesses various cognitive skills.


**1.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, significantly altered regulations concerning the use of donor gametes in surrogacy. Which statement accurately reflects this change?**

(a) The rules completely banned the use of donor gametes in surrogacy procedures.
(b) The rules now permit the use of donor gametes only if the child has at least one gamete from the intending couple.
(c)  The rules allow unrestricted use of donor gametes for all intending couples.
(d) The rules maintain the previous prohibition on donor gametes, with no exceptions.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 amendment to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules directly addresses the use of donor gametes.  Prior rules (2022) prohibited their use. The amendment introduces a crucial modification: donor gametes are permissible *only* if the resulting child inherits at least one gamete (either egg or sperm) from one of the intending parents. This balances the ethical concerns around complete genetic unrelatedness with the medical needs of certain couples facing infertility. Options (a) and (d) are incorrect because they contradict the amendment's allowance of donor gametes under specific conditions. Option (c) is incorrect as the amendment explicitly restricts the use of donor gametes.  The amendment demonstrates a nuanced approach to surrogacy regulation, attempting to reconcile ethical considerations with medical realities.


**2.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, as amended, sets specific gestational limits for legal abortion.  Considering these limits, which scenario is *not* legally permissible under the amended act?**

(a) Termination of a 22-week pregnancy due to severe fetal abnormalities, as determined by a medical board.
(b) Termination of a 19-week pregnancy at the request of a married woman based on the advice of one doctor.
(c) Termination of a 26-week pregnancy due to a threat to the mother's life.
(d) Termination of a 21-week pregnancy for a woman who experienced rape, based on the advice of two doctors.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The amended MTP Act allows abortion up to 20 weeks for all women based on one doctor's advice.  Between 20 and 24 weeks, specific categories of women (including rape survivors) can access abortion with the advice of two doctors.  Beyond 24 weeks, abortion is only permissible in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, as determined by a medical board. Option (c) describes a scenario beyond the 24-week limit and outside the legally defined exceptions. Therefore, a 26-week termination, even with a life-threatening condition to the mother, is not legally permissible under the current framework of the MTP Act. Options (a), (b), and (d) fall within the gestational limits and legally defined exceptions of the amended act.  The question highlights the complexities and limitations of abortion access, even in cases of significant medical need, under Indian law.


**3. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme is a key initiative aimed at eradicating child labour in India.  Which of the following is NOT a primary objective of the NCLP?**

(a) Providing special schools and rehabilitation centers for child laborers.
(b) Implementing stringent penalties for employers who hire children.
(c)  Facilitating the rehabilitation and reintegration of child laborers into mainstream society.
(d) Offering vocational training and skill development programs for rescued children.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCLP focuses on the rescue, rehabilitation, and reintegration of child laborers.  It provides educational and vocational training to help them lead productive lives. While the NCLP indirectly contributes to deterring child labor by creating alternatives, its primary focus is not on directly penalizing employers. That responsibility lies with other legal frameworks and enforcement agencies.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are all core components of the NCLP's approach to addressing child labor.  The distinction between direct enforcement (penalties) and rehabilitation (support for rescued children) is crucial in understanding the NCLP's role.  The NCLP operates within a broader ecosystem of legal and social support mechanisms to combat child labor.


**4. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, provides legal recourse for women experiencing domestic abuse.  Which of the following is NOT explicitly covered under the definition of domestic violence in the PWDVA?**

(a) Physical abuse
(b) Economic abuse
(c)  Social ostracism by the community
(d)  Sexual abuse


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA defines domestic violence comprehensively, including physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.  However, it does *not* extend to social ostracism by the wider community.  While social ostracism can be a consequence or a contributing factor to domestic violence, it is not itself explicitly defined as a form of domestic violence under the Act. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all clearly defined forms of domestic violence within the scope of the PWDVA. The question tests the understanding of the specific legal definition of domestic violence, highlighting the boundaries of the Act's protection.  The PWDVA focuses on actions within the domestic sphere, not broader societal pressures, emphasizing the importance of clear legal definitions in addressing specific forms of violence.


**5. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), establishes a grievance redressal mechanism.  Which entity is NOT directly involved in the POSH Act's complaint handling process?**

(a) Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)
(b) Local Complaints Committee
(c)  National Commission for Women (NCW)
(d)  Employer of the workplace


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act mandates the establishment of ICCs in workplaces with 10 or more employees.  For smaller workplaces or complaints against the employer, Local Committees are formed. Employers have a crucial role in implementing the ICC's recommendations. The NCW, while playing a broader role in women's rights advocacy, is not directly involved in the day-to-day complaint handling process under the POSH Act.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all integral parts of the POSH Act's internal grievance redressal mechanism. This question tests the knowledge of the Act's specific institutional structure and procedural aspects, focusing on the roles and responsibilities of various entities involved. The absence of NCW's direct involvement emphasizes the decentralized nature of the POSH Act's complaint handling.



**6.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) emphasizes several key principles for reforming school education. Which of the following is NOT a primary focus area of the NCF-SE?**

(a) Development of capacities for scientific inquiry.
(b)  Integration of vocational training directly into the primary school curriculum.
(c) Incorporation of environmental education at all stages of schooling.
(d) Promotion of interdisciplinary areas of study.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE advocates for a holistic education encompassing scientific inquiry, environmental consciousness, and interdisciplinary approaches. While vocational skills are important, the NCF-SE doesn't advocate for their direct integration into the primary school curriculum. It focuses on foundational learning and skill development at later stages. Options (a), (c), and (d) are all explicit features of the NCF-SE's approach to school curriculum reform.  The question tests understanding of the NCF-SE's phased approach to skill development, highlighting the distinction between foundational learning in primary school and specialized training at later stages. The NCF-SE aims to build a strong foundation before introducing specialized vocational training.


**7. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) assesses the state of hunger globally.  Which of the following is NOT a component considered in the GHI calculation?**

(a) Undernourishment
(b) Child stunting
(c)  Adult literacy rate
(d) Child wasting


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GHI uses four indicators: undernourishment prevalence, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality.  Adult literacy rate is not directly included in the GHI's calculation. While literacy can indirectly impact nutrition outcomes, it's not a core component of the index's methodology. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all key indicators directly used in the GHI calculation. The question tests knowledge of the specific metrics used in a globally recognized index, highlighting the focus on child health and nutrition as core indicators of hunger. The GHI focuses on direct indicators of nutritional status and mortality, rather than broader socioeconomic factors.


**8.  The  "ODF Plus" initiative under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) aims to enhance sanitation beyond basic Open Defecation Free (ODF) status. Which element is NOT a criterion for achieving ODF Plus Model village status?**

(a) Sustained ODF status
(b) Arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management
(c)  Complete eradication of poverty in the village
(d)  Observance of visual cleanliness in public places


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

ODF Plus Model village status requires sustained ODF status, systems for solid and liquid waste management, and visual cleanliness.  Eradication of poverty is a separate and broader developmental goal, not a direct criterion for ODF Plus Model village status. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all essential components of the ODF Plus Model village criteria. The question tests understanding of a specific government program's goals and implementation metrics, highlighting the focus on environmental sanitation rather than socioeconomic indicators.  The ODF Plus initiative focuses on improving sanitation infrastructure and practices, not directly addressing poverty alleviation.


**9. The  National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, aims to strengthen research and innovation in India. Which of the following statements about the NRF is *incorrect*?**

(a) The NRF is intended to catalyze research and innovation across various disciplines.
(b)  The NRF is primarily focused on funding research in the field of defense technology.
(c) The NRF aims to expand research capabilities across the country.
(d) The NRF seeks to foster collaboration between academic institutions and industry.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NRF's mandate is broad, encompassing various disciplines and promoting collaboration between academia and industry to boost research and innovation nationally.  It is *not* primarily focused on defense technology; its scope is much wider. Options (a), (c), and (d) are all accurate descriptions of the NRF's objectives.  The question tests the understanding of the NRF's broad scope and objectives, emphasizing its role in promoting overall research and innovation, not just in a single sector. The NRF aims to create a vibrant and diverse research ecosystem across India.


**10. The  Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) is a key initiative under the National Credit Framework (NCrF). Which of the following statements about the ABC is incorrect?**

(a) The ABC is a digital platform for storing academic credits earned from various institutions.
(b) The ABC allows for the transfer of credits between different types of educational institutions.
(c) The ABC is exclusively for students enrolled in traditional four-year degree programs.
(d) The ABC facilitates flexibility and mobility in higher education.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ABC is designed to be inclusive, storing credits earned from various educational pathways, including vocational and skill-based training, not just traditional degree programs.  Its purpose is to enhance flexibility and mobility in education. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect the ABC's functions. The question tests understanding of the ABC's inclusive nature and its role in promoting flexible learning pathways. The ABC is intended to support diverse learning experiences and career trajectories.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and focuses on specific details, demanding factual recall and analysis.  The difficulty level is primarily "difficult" due to the nuanced nature of the information and the inclusion of plausible distractors.


**1.  The Gender Social Norms Index, released by a specific UN agency, seeks to understand a critical societal issue. Which of the following best describes the core focus of this index?**

(a)  Measuring the economic productivity of women in various nations.
(b)  Assessing the level of political representation achieved by women globally.
(c)  Analyzing systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women worldwide.
(d)  Evaluating the overall health and well-being of women compared to men internationally.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Gender Social Norms Index, released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), explicitly aims to understand the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women across the globe.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent aspects of gender equality but do not capture the index's core focus on the underlying societal norms that perpetuate inequality. The index goes beyond simple metrics of representation or economic output to delve into the deeper cultural and social structures that contribute to gender disparity.  Understanding these norms is crucial for designing effective interventions to promote gender equality.


**2.  A significant report, jointly prepared by two UN agencies, introduced twin indices to assess the status of women's empowerment and gender equality.  Which of the following correctly identifies these two indices?**

(a)  Global Gender Gap Index and Gender Inequality Index.
(b)  Women's Empowerment Index and Global Gender Parity Index.
(c)  Human Development Index and Gender Development Index.
(d)  Social Progress Index and Gender Equality Index.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The "Path to Equal" report, a joint initiative of UN Women and the UNDP, introduced the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI).  The WEI focuses solely on women's agency and capabilities, while the GGPI compares women's status to men's across key development dimensions. Options (a), (c), and (d) include indices that relate to gender or development, but they are not the specific indices presented in the "Path to Equal" report.  The creation of these two indices represents a sophisticated approach to measuring gender equality, moving beyond simple metrics to capture the multifaceted nature of women's empowerment.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct; the Act allows for handling human waste if proper protective gear is used, differentiating between hazardous and safe practices. Option (b) is incorrect; the Act criminalizes both the construction *and* continued use of insanitary latrines. Option (c) is incorrect; the definition of manual scavengers is broader, including those employed in various settings, not just municipalities. Option (d) is incorrect; the Act lays down specific measures for rehabilitation, including alternative employment and financial assistance.

The question tests knowledge of the NCPCR's role and its recent actions in safeguarding children's rights, particularly within the justice system.  Understanding the complexities of juvenile justice and the role of organizations like the NCPCR is essential for analyzing the effectiveness of child protection mechanisms.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assess different cognitive skills, with detailed explanations provided.


**1.  The statement "Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of Scheduled Tribes in absolute numbers" is directly linked to which of the following governmental bodies?**

(a)  The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b)  The National Commission for Scheduled Castes
(c)  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d)  The National Human Rights Commission


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for Scheduled Tribes.  The other options are involved in social justice issues but are not the primary governmental body responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.  The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with broader social justice issues, including Scheduled Castes and other marginalized groups. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes focuses specifically on Scheduled Castes.  The National Human Rights Commission addresses human rights violations across various social groups.  Therefore, only the Ministry of Tribal Affairs directly relates to the statement about Madhya Pradesh's Scheduled Tribe population.


**2.  Which of the following groups is NOT categorized as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) based on criteria including pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population?**

(a) Bharia
(b)  Kamar
(c)  Baiga
(d)  Hakki Pikki


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly names Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga as PVTGs.  The Hakki Pikki tribe is described as a semi-nomadic group, but it's not explicitly identified as a PVTG in the provided text. The criteria for PVTG status focuses on specific indicators of vulnerability related to economic and social development, which the Hakki Pikki, as a semi-nomadic group, may or may not meet.  While semi-nomadic groups might face challenges, the defining criteria for PVTGs are not directly addressed for the Hakki Pikki in this text.


**3. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, later repealed, is directly relevant to the understanding of which marginalized group in India?**

(a)  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(b)  De-notified Tribes (DNTs)
(c)  Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)
(d)  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (excluding DNTs)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly explains that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 wrongly labelled certain communities as "born criminals," leading to their categorization as De-notified Tribes (DNTs) after the act's repeal.  The other options are distinct groups with different historical and socio-economic contexts.  PVTGs are a specific subset of Scheduled Tribes. Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) are defined by their physical or mental impairments. Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes are a broader category, with DNTs being a subset facing unique historical injustices stemming from the Criminal Tribes Act.


**4. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is primarily tasked with which of the following?**

(a)  Providing scholarships to DNT students.
(b)  Constructing hostels for DNT children.
(c)  Developing economic empowerment schemes for DNT communities.
(d)  Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the NCDNT is tasked with preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.  While the other options represent initiatives to support DNT communities (scholarships, hostels, and economic empowerment schemes), they are distinct programs implemented by different government bodies, not the primary responsibility of the NCDNT itself. The NCDNT's mandate is focused on data collection and categorization, forming the basis for targeted welfare programs.


**5.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates which of the following actions regarding government offices housed in inaccessible buildings?**

(a)  Construction of new, accessible buildings.
(b)  Financial compensation for employees with disabilities.
(c)  Relocation of services to accessible locations within the same facility or to the ground floor.
(d)  Establishment of special transportation services for employees with disabilities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that government offices in inaccessible buildings must relocate their services to the ground floor or an accessible location within the same facility.  The other options are not directly mandated by the RPwD Act as described in the text. While improving accessibility is a broader goal of the Act, the specific action regarding relocation of services in inaccessible buildings is directly mentioned.


**6.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) primarily aims to prevent which of the following practices?**

(a)  The employment of individuals in hazardous waste disposal without proper protective gear.
(b)  The construction of sanitary latrines in urban areas.
(c)  The provision of financial assistance to sanitation workers.
(d)  The employment of individuals to clean sewers and septic tanks using mechanized equipment.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act focuses on prohibiting the employment of individuals to handle human waste manually, particularly without proper protective equipment. The act addresses the hazardous nature of manual scavenging and aims to eliminate it.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are not the primary aims of the PEMSR Act. While the act promotes the construction of sanitary latrines and the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, these are secondary aspects of its overall goal of eradicating manual scavenging.


**7.  The "Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)" is directly associated with which of the following objectives?**

(a)  Providing concessional loans for sanitation equipment procurement.
(b)  Promoting the construction of community sanitary latrines.
(c)  Rehabilitating identified manual scavengers in alternative professions.
(d)  Developing a national policy for mechanized sanitation.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text specifically mentions that the SRMS scheme aims to rehabilitate identified manual scavengers by providing them with opportunities in alternative professions. The other options represent different initiatives related to sanitation and manual scavenger rehabilitation, but they are not directly associated with the SRMS scheme.  The SRMS focuses specifically on providing alternative employment opportunities.


**8. The  "National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem" aims to directly address which of the following issues?**

(a) The provision of health insurance to sanitation workers.
(b) The elimination of hazardous cleaning and prevention of deaths among sewer and septic tank workers.
(c) The construction of community sanitary latrines.
(d) The implementation of the Swachhta Udyami Yojana.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices and prevent deaths among sewer and septic tank workers. This policy directly addresses the safety and well-being of sanitation workers.  The other options are related to sanitation improvement but are not the central focus of this specific policy.


**9.  The  "Swachhta Udyami Yojana" is primarily concerned with which of the following?**

(a)  Providing training to sanitation workers on the use of mechanized equipment.
(b)  Providing concessional loans for procurement of sanitation-related equipment.
(c)  Identifying and rehabilitating manual scavengers.
(d)  Promoting the construction of community sanitary latrines.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for procuring sanitation-related equipment. This scheme focuses on financial assistance to facilitate the acquisition of necessary tools and technologies.  The other options are related to sanitation improvement but are not the primary function of this specific scheme.


**10.  The term "ODF Plus village" signifies a village that has:**

(a)  Implemented only solid waste management systems.
(b)  Implemented only liquid waste management systems.
(c)  Sustained its ODF status and implemented either solid or liquid waste management systems.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The definition of an "ODF Plus village" explicitly states that it has sustained its Open Defecation Free (ODF) status and implemented either solid or liquid waste management systems.  This indicates a higher level of sanitation compared to simply being ODF.  The other options are not fully accurate representations of the ODF Plus status.  The ODF Plus concept goes beyond simply building latrines to include comprehensive waste management.


**11. The  "ODF Plus Model village"  goes beyond the basic ODF Plus status by incorporating which additional crucial element?**

(a)  Financial incentives for villagers to maintain sanitation standards.
(b)  Regular health check-ups for all villagers.
(c)  Observing visual cleanliness, minimal litter, and absence of plastic waste in public places.
(d)  Establishment of a village sanitation committee.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that an ODF Plus Model village demonstrates visual cleanliness, minimal litter, and the absence of plastic waste in public areas, in addition to the basic ODF Plus requirements.  This emphasizes the overall aesthetic and hygienic environment of the village. The other options, while beneficial for sanitation, are not specifically defining characteristics of an ODF Plus Model village as described in the text.

(a)  The prevalence of child marriage in India.
(b)  The access to quality education across different states.

(d)  The literacy rate among women in India.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text specifically mentions that the NFHS-5 report provides data on the percentage of ever-married women who have experienced spousal violence.  This report focuses on health and family-related indicators. While the other options are important social issues, the text only directly connects NFHS-5 data to spousal violence.

(d)  The access to healthcare services for women in developing countries.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text defines the Gender Social Norms Index as aiming to understand the systemic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women globally.  The index focuses on the broader societal norms that perpetuate gender inequality. While the other options are related to gender equality, the core focus of this index is on understanding the root causes of gender discrimination.

(b) Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NSNTs)
(c) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(d) Scheduled Castes (SCs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  The text explicitly states that these groups, initially termed Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), were first recognized in 1973 based on the recommendations of the UNDhebar Commission (1961).  The other options are distinct categories. DNTs are communities historically labeled as "criminal tribes" during British rule. NSNTs represent a broader category of mobile communities, and SCs are a separate scheduled caste category.  The question focuses on a specific sub-category of Scheduled Tribes with a unique historical designation and identification process.  The precision of the question's wording—particularly mentioning the year of initial recognition and the originating commission—makes it a challenging yet fair assessment of factual recall.


**2.  The Hakki Pikki Tribe, a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka, is categorized under which broader classification of tribal communities in India?**

(a) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(b) De-notified Tribes (DNTs)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NSNTs). The provided text explicitly mentions the Hakki Pikki Tribe as an example of a semi-nomadic group. While some nomadic groups might overlap with PVTGs or DNTs, the Hakki Pikki Tribe's classification is clearly stated within the context of NSNTs.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent distinct social categories not directly related to the Hakki Pikki Tribe's mobility and lifestyle.  This question tests the ability to apply knowledge of tribal classifications to a specific example, requiring a deeper understanding than simply recalling definitions.


**3. Which state in India currently houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Jharkhand
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) Odisha. The passage explicitly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh also have PVTGs, Odisha's prominence in this regard is specifically mentioned, making this a straightforward factual recall question.  The other options, while also containing PVTGs, are incorrect because they do not possess the highest number.  The question's simplicity contrasts with the detail required to answer it correctly, highlighting the need for precise factual knowledge.


**4.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently emphasized the implementation of a report recommending the establishment of a permanent commission for which specific group of communities in India?**

(d) Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs/NSNTs).  The text directly mentions the NHRC's focus on implementing the Idate Commission report, which specifically addresses the need for a permanent commission for these combined groups.  The other options, while representing vulnerable populations, are not the direct focus of the NHRC's statement as described in the provided text. This question assesses the ability to link a named organization (NHRC) with a specific policy recommendation regarding a particular vulnerable group.


**5. Which Ministry in the Indian government is designated as the nodal ministry for tribal welfare?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Home Affairs

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The passage explicitly states that the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for tribal welfare. The other options, while involved in welfare initiatives for other marginalized groups, are not specifically designated as the nodal ministry for tribal welfare. This is a straightforward factual recall question requiring knowledge of governmental structures and responsibilities.


**6.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, later repealed, was primarily associated with which community in India?**

(a) Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NSNTs)
(b) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(c) De-notified Tribes (DNTs)
(d) Scheduled Castes (SCs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) De-notified Tribes (DNTs). The text explicitly explains that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 targeted communities later designated as De-notified Tribes (DNTs) because they were labeled as "born criminals."  The other options are different categories of marginalized communities not directly linked to this specific historical legislation.  This question tests the ability to connect a historical act with its social impact, requiring understanding beyond simple definitions.


**7.  The "SEED" scheme, launched by a specific Indian ministry, aims to economically empower which particular group?**

(a) Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)
(b) De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs/NSNTs)
(c) Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(d) Scheduled Tribes (STs)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs/NSNTs).  The text clearly states that the "Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)" is targeted at this specific group.  The other options are different marginalized groups, highlighting the targeted nature of this specific scheme. This question tests the ability to connect a specific government scheme with its intended beneficiary group, requiring knowledge of social welfare programs.


**8. Which Act in India specifically prohibits the employment of manual scavengers and outlines their rehabilitation?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016
(c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(d) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. The text directly mentions this Act as the legal framework addressing the issue of manual scavenging and the rehabilitation of those involved.  The other options are related to different social issues and do not directly address manual scavenging. This question tests knowledge of specific legislation related to a particular social problem.

(d) Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The text explicitly states that NAMASTE (National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem) is a joint initiative of these two ministries.  The other options involve ministries with related but not directly involved responsibilities in sanitation initiatives.  This question tests knowledge of inter-ministerial collaborations in social welfare programs.

(a) 12 weeks
(b) 16 weeks
(c) 20 weeks
(d) 24 weeks

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 20 weeks.  The text mentions that the 2021 amendment to the MTP Act allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women based on the advice of one doctor.  The other options present incorrect gestational limits. This question requires precise recall of the legal changes related to reproductive rights.


**11.  The  "Poshan Tracker" mobile application is primarily used to monitor and track which aspect of child health and nutrition in India?**

(a)  Access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities
(b)  Immunization coverage among children
(c)  Nutritional status and service delivery under Anganwadi services
(d)  Prevalence of child labour and exploitation

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Nutritional status and service delivery under Anganwadi services. The text directly connects the Poshan Tracker app to the monitoring of nutritional indicators (stunting, wasting, underweight) and the tracking of service delivery through Anganwadi centres. The other options represent different aspects of child health and well-being but are not the primary focus of the app as described in the text.  This question tests the application of technology in social welfare programs.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and careful analysis.


**1.  Concerning the Swachhta Udyami Yojana and NAMASTE scheme, which statement is accurate?**

(a)  Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides grants for sanitation equipment, while NAMASTE focuses solely on sewer cleaning.
(b)  NAMASTE is a solely MoHUA initiative, aiming for complete mechanization of sanitation processes.
(c)  Swachhta Udyami Yojana offers concessional loans for sanitation equipment, and NAMASTE promotes complete sanitation mechanization, encompassing various waste management aspects.
(d)  Both schemes are primarily concerned with rural sanitation, leaving urban sanitation to other initiatives.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately reflects the nature of both schemes. Swachhta Udyami Yojana specifically targets providing financial assistance (concessional loans) to entrepreneurs for procuring sanitation-related equipment.  NAMASTE, a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), is a far broader scheme aimed at complete mechanization of the sanitation ecosystem. This includes not only sewer cleaning but also septic tank cleaning, drain desilting, garbage lifting, sludge handling, and the disposal of solid and medical waste.  Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent either the funding mechanism or the scope of at least one of the schemes.  (a) is incorrect because Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides *loans*, not grants. (b) is incorrect as NAMASTE is a *joint* initiative. (d) is incorrect as the schemes address both rural and urban contexts, although their implementation might vary geographically.


**2.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) primarily aims to:**

(a)  Provide vocational training to DNT members exclusively.
(b)  Prepare a comprehensive national-level list of DNT communities and their traditional occupations.
(c)  Administer the financial aid schemes specifically designed for DNTs across India.
(d)  Prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) correctly identifies the primary mandate of NCDNT.  The commission's crucial role is to compile a state-wise list of castes that fall under the DNT category. This is a foundational step for targeted policy interventions and welfare programs. While the other options might be related activities undertaken by the government or organizations working with DNTs, they are not the core function of the NCDNT itself.  (a) is too narrow, focusing on only one aspect of DNT welfare. (b) is inaccurate; while understanding occupations is relevant, the primary aim is state-wise caste listing. (c) is incorrect because the NCDNT is not directly responsible for administering financial aid, although it informs the design and implementation of such schemes.



**3.  Which of the following is NOT a feature of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)?**

(a)  A 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.

(c)  Emphasis on multilingualism, with proficiency in at least three languages, including at least two Indian languages.
(d)  A rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary stage.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) accurately highlights a key departure from previous frameworks. The NCF-SE explicitly *rejects* rigid separations between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level, promoting flexibility and choice for students.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all features of the NCF-SE. (a) describes the new age-based structure. (b) outlines the three categories of vocational work proposed. (c) emphasizes the promotion of multilingualism within the Indian context.

**Correct Answer:** (b) and (d)

**Explanation:**

Both (b) and (d) are correct.  The Prime Minister is explicitly mentioned as the ex-officio President of the NRF Governing Board. The act also clearly states that the NRF incorporates and subsumes SERB, including its existing funds.  (a) is incorrect; the NRF's funding sources are diverse, including central government grants, donations, investment income, and existing SERB funds. (c) is incorrect because the NRF's scope explicitly includes natural sciences, engineering, technology, environmental and earth sciences, health, agriculture, and the scientific and technological interfaces of humanities and social sciences.

The Act explicitly recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability, and mandates reservation in both government jobs (4%) and higher educational institutions (5%).  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect. (a) is incorrect because the reservation is *not* applicable to police forces. (b) is false; intellectual disability is explicitly included.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The report clearly states that over 108.4 million people were forcibly displaced globally in 2022. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect. (a) is wrong; low- and middle-income countries hosted the majority. (b) is false; displacement was *higher* in 2022. (c) is incorrect; children constituted a significantly higher percentage.

(c) IFPRI is a major research center affiliated with the CGIAR, a global partnership focused on food security.
(d) IFPRI's research primarily focuses on improving agricultural yields in high-income countries.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is indeed a significant research center under the CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research).  CGIAR is a global partnership dedicated to research for a food-secure future.  Option (a) is incorrect as IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C. Option (b) is partially true, as climate change is a factor in IFPRI's research, but it's not the primary focus.  Option (d) is incorrect; IFPRI's work spans numerous countries, including many low- and middle-income nations, aiming to alleviate poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Its research encompasses various aspects of food systems, from production to policy.


**2. The UNHCR's 2022 report, "Global Trends: Forced Displacement," highlighted which key finding?**

(a) A decrease in forced displacement due to improved global security.
(b) A significant rise in forced migration attributed to social and climate crises compared to 2021.
(c) Low- and middle-income countries hosting a minority of the world's refugees.
(d)  A decrease in the number of stateless individuals globally.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNHCR report explicitly noted a 21% increase in forced displacement due to social and climate crises in 2022 compared to 2021. Option (a) is incorrect; the report showed a substantial increase, not a decrease, in displacement. Option (c) is false; the report indicated that 76% of refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries. Option (d) is also incorrect; the report showed a 2% increase in stateless individuals. The report's findings underscore the growing challenges faced by refugees and displaced populations globally, highlighting the interconnectedness of conflict, social instability, and environmental factors.


**3.  The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) recently took which action concerning the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India?**

(a) Granted full accreditation to the NHRC without any reservations.
(b)  Permanently revoked the NHRC's accreditation.
(c) Deferred the NHRC's accreditation, citing concerns about political interference and other issues.
(d)  Merged the NHRC with another international human rights organization.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** GANHRI, for the second consecutive time, deferred the NHRC's accreditation.  This decision stemmed from concerns regarding political interference in appointments, the involvement of police in human rights violation investigations, and inadequate collaboration with civil society.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.  The deferral highlights the importance of upholding international standards for human rights institutions and the need for independent functioning free from political influence.  The Paris Principles, which GANHRI uses for accreditation, emphasize these aspects of autonomy and independence.


**4.  Which of the following accurately describes the mandate of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)?**

(a) To primarily focus on indigenous land rights and resource management.
(b)  To exclusively address indigenous cultural preservation efforts.
(c) To advise the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on indigenous issues related to various aspects of development and human rights.
(d) To solely represent indigenous peoples' interests in international courts.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The UNPFII is a high-level advisory body to the UN ECOSOC. Its mandate encompasses a broad range of indigenous issues, including economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights. Option (a) is too narrow; while land rights are a component, the mandate is much broader. Option (b) is also too limited; UNPFII addresses many issues beyond cultural preservation.  Option (d) is incorrect; UNPFII is an advisory body, not a judicial entity. The UNPFII's work is critical in raising awareness and advocating for the rights and needs of indigenous populations globally.



**5. The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs in India is characterized by which feature?**

(a)  It exclusively uses globally standardized indicators without any country-specific adaptations.
(b) It is a static framework with a fixed number of indicators that do not change over time.
(a) It incorporates indicators aligned with global SDG indicators and also includes India-specific indicators.
(d) It is solely managed and maintained by international organizations.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The NIF for SDGs in India is designed to align with the global SDG indicator framework but also incorporates indicators tailored to India's specific needs and context.  Option (a) is incorrect; the NIF includes both global and national indicators. Option (b) is false; the NIF is evolving, with the number of indicators subject to change over time. Option (d) is incorrect; the NIF is primarily developed and managed by India's Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), though it collaborates with international partners. The inclusion of India-specific indicators allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of progress towards the SDGs within the country's context.


**6.  The recent report on the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 in higher education highlighted which key aspect?**

(a)  A significant decrease in the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NEP 2020 emphasizes the establishment of a National Research Foundation (NRF) to bolster research and innovation in higher education. Option (a) is incorrect; the report likely showed an increase or at least maintenance of GER. Option (b) is false; multiple exit options are a key feature of the NEP. Option (d) is incorrect; the text indicates an increase, not decrease, in the number of Indian universities in global rankings. The NRF's creation is a significant step towards enhancing India's research capabilities and aligning higher education with global standards.

(c)  Allowing surrogacy using donor gametes under certain conditions.
(d)  Removal of all regulations related to altruistic surrogacy.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The amendment rules allow surrogacy with donor gametes if the intending couple has a medical condition requiring it, provided at least one gamete is from the couple. Option (a) is incorrect; altruistic surrogacy remains legal.  Option (b) is false; commercial surrogacy remains prohibited. Option (d) is incorrect; regulations on altruistic surrogacy were not removed. This change reflects a nuanced approach to surrogacy, balancing ethical considerations with the medical needs of infertile couples.

(d)  There is no legal framework in place to address the issue of manual scavenging.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** While many districts have declared themselves free from manual scavenging, complete eradication remains a goal. Option (a) is incorrect; manual scavenging persists in some areas. Option (c) is false; the 2013 Act is still in effect. Option (d) is incorrect; the 2013 Act provides a legal framework. The persistence of manual scavenging despite legal prohibitions highlights the challenges in enforcing legislation and addressing the deeply entrenched social and economic factors contributing to this practice.


**10. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, includes which key provision?**

(a)  It exclusively focuses on physical violence and excludes other forms of abuse.
(b) It explicitly criminalizes marital rape.
(c) It provides for civil remedies but not criminal proceedings for domestic violence.
(d)  It defines domestic violence to encompass physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and/or sexual abuse.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The PWDVA defines domestic violence broadly, including various forms of abuse. Option (a) is incorrect; it covers a range of abuses. Option (b) is false; while it addresses violence, it doesn't specifically criminalize marital rape. Option (c) is incorrect; it allows for civil remedies, and criminal charges can be pursued under other laws. The comprehensive definition of domestic violence in the PWDVA is critical in providing legal recourse for women facing various forms of abuse within their homes.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and focuses on specific details and interdisciplinary connections.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that August 9th marks the date of the first meeting in 1982 of the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission on Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.  Option (a) is incorrect; while the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is a crucial document, the text doesn't link it to a specific date in August. Options (c) and (d) are also incorrect; the UN Permanent Forum was established later, and while August 9th is now International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, the text connects the date to the earlier working group meeting.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the historical context of UN involvement in indigenous rights.

This question tests factual recall and links it to the understanding of policy recommendations concerning marginalized communities.


**6. Which ministry is the nodal ministry for the welfare of tribal populations in India?**

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Home Affairs
(d) Ministry of Tribal Affairs

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly identifies the Ministry of Tribal Affairs as the nodal ministry for tribal welfare. The other options, while involved in related social programs, do not have the primary responsibility for tribal welfare as stated in the text.  This question tests factual recall of governmental structure and responsibilities.

(b) The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(c) The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly asks about the Act that repealed the Criminal Tribes Act.  The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, served that purpose.  The other options are related to the protection of vulnerable groups but don't specifically address the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.  This question tests factual recall regarding specific legislation related to marginalized communities in India.  The historical context adds difficulty.


**1.  A significant social reform movement in India advocated for the rights of individuals whose gender identity differs from their assigned sex at birth.  Which legislative act directly addresses the rights and protections of this community?**

(a)  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(b)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(c)  The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019
(d)  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, specifically aims to protect the rights of transgender individuals in India.  It recognizes their right to self-perceived gender identity, prohibits discrimination in various sectors (employment, education, healthcare), and establishes a grievance redressal mechanism.  Options (a), (b), and (d) address different vulnerable groups and social issues but do not directly focus on the rights of transgender persons.  The Juvenile Justice Act deals with children, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act addresses caste-based discrimination, and the POCSO Act focuses on child sexual abuse.  Therefore, only option (c) accurately reflects the legislative framework specifically designed for the protection of transgender rights.  The act, while facing criticisms, remains the primary legal instrument addressing this specific community's needs within the Indian legal system.  Understanding this legislation is crucial for comprehending the complexities of social justice and inclusion in India's diverse population.

**2.  The practice of manually removing human excreta from sewers or septic tanks, despite being legally prohibited, persists in certain parts of India. What legislation explicitly criminalizes this practice and mandates the rehabilitation of those involved?**

(a)  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976
(b)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(c)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(d)  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, specifically targets the practice of manual scavenging.  It criminalizes the employment of individuals for this hazardous task, outlines penalties for violations, and importantly, includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment opportunities and financial assistance.  While options (a), (c), and (d) address other forms of exploitation and social injustices, they don't directly address the specific issue of manual scavenging and its associated rehabilitation measures.  The Bonded Labour Act focuses on forced labor, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act targets caste-based atrocities, and the Immoral Traffic Act deals with sex trafficking.  Therefore, option (b) accurately identifies the legislation directly tackling manual scavenging and its associated rehabilitation concerns, a critical aspect of social justice and public health in India.  The act's effectiveness remains a subject of ongoing debate and requires further implementation to truly eliminate the practice.

**3.  The Indian government has implemented various schemes to improve the socio-economic conditions of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). Which state houses the highest number of these groups?**

(a)  Madhya Pradesh
(b)  Chhattisgarh
(c)  Andhra Pradesh
(d)  Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Odisha currently has the highest number of recognized Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) within its borders.  While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh also have significant PVTG populations, Odisha's count surpasses them.  The identification of PVTGs is based on criteria such as pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and declining populations.  These groups often face unique challenges and require targeted interventions for their development.  The government's focus on PVTGs highlights the need for inclusive policies and programs to address the specific vulnerabilities of these marginalized communities.  Understanding the geographical distribution of PVTGs is crucial for effective resource allocation and policy implementation.  The concentration of PVTGs in Odisha necessitates focused attention on their specific needs in the region.


**4.  A legal framework in India aims to regulate and supervise Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) clinics and banks to prevent misuse and ensure ethical practices while addressing reproductive health issues. What is the name of this legislation?**

(a)  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
(b)  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971
(c)  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021
(d)  The Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, specifically addresses the regulation of ART clinics and banks.  It aims to establish ethical guidelines, prevent exploitation, and ensure the safety and well-being of individuals undergoing ART procedures.  While the Surrogacy Act complements ART regulation by focusing on surrogacy practices, it doesn't encompass the broader scope of ART technologies.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act deals with abortion, and the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act focuses on sex selection.  Therefore, option (c) accurately identifies the legislation dedicated to regulating and overseeing the entire spectrum of ART practices in India, highlighting the government's effort to balance technological advancements with ethical considerations in reproductive healthcare.  This act is a significant step towards ensuring responsible and safe access to ART services.


**5.  A legal framework in India aims to protect children from sexual assault, sexual harassment, and pornography.  Which Act is specifically designed for this purpose?**

(a)  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(b)  The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019
(c)  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012
(d)  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, is specifically designed to safeguard children from various forms of sexual abuse. It defines different sexual offenses against children, establishes special courts for speedy trials, and provides for the protection and rehabilitation of victims.  While the Juvenile Justice Act addresses broader aspects of child welfare, the POCSO Act specifically focuses on sexual crimes against children. The Transgender Persons Act deals with transgender rights, and the Immoral Traffic Act addresses sex trafficking.  Therefore, only option (c) directly addresses the protection of children from sexual offenses, reflecting a crucial legal framework for child safety and the prevention of sexual abuse.  The Act's provisions for child-friendly procedures and specialized courts are vital to ensuring justice for victims.


**6.  The Indian government launched a significant initiative on Janjatiya Gaurav Divas (Tribal Pride Day) to provide basic facilities to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). What is the name of this initiative?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi
(c)  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
(d)  PM JANMAN (PM- Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PM JANMAN (PM- Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan) is a comprehensive initiative launched by the Indian government to improve the living conditions of PVTGs.  This program aims to provide access to safe housing, clean water, sanitation, education, healthcare, and nutrition. The other options, while important government schemes, are not specifically targeted at PVTGs. Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana focuses on financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi provides income support to farmers, and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana addresses housing needs.  Therefore, only option (d) accurately identifies the initiative focused on improving the lives of PVTGs, demonstrating the government's commitment to addressing the unique challenges faced by these vulnerable communities.  The multi-pronged approach of PM JANMAN aims to achieve holistic development within these communities.


**7.  India's National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) underwent a significant revision to align with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. What is the primary age-based structure proposed in this revised framework for school education?**

(a)  4+4+4 design
(b)  5+3+3+4 design
(c)  6+3+3+4 design
(d)  7+3+3+4 design

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The revised NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 design for school education, aligning with the NEP 2020. This framework divides schooling into four stages based on age groups: foundational stage (ages 3-8), preparatory stage (ages 8-11), middle stage (ages 11-14), and secondary stage (ages 14-18).  The other options do not reflect the structure proposed by the NCF-SE.  This restructuring aims to create a more holistic and flexible education system, promoting foundational literacy and numeracy skills while incorporating interdisciplinary learning and vocational education.  The shift to this new structure is a pivotal change in India's education system, requiring significant adjustments in curriculum design and pedagogical approaches.  The 5+3+3+4 structure is a cornerstone of the NEP 2020's vision for transformative educational reform.


**8.  The Ministry of Education in India released a performance grading index to assess the performance of school education systems at the state and district levels. What is the name of this index?**

(a)  National Achievement Survey (NAS)
(b)  Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+)
(c)  Performance Grading Index (PGI)
(d)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Performance Grading Index (PGI) is specifically designed to evaluate the performance of school education systems in India at both the state and district levels. This index uses data from various sources to assess different aspects of the education system.  While NAS, UDISE+, and NIRF are important tools in educational assessment, they do not serve the same purpose as PGI.  NAS focuses on student learning outcomes, UDISE+ provides data on educational infrastructure, and NIRF ranks higher educational institutions.  Therefore, option (c) accurately identifies the index specifically used to grade the performance of school education systems at the state and district levels, providing a comprehensive overview of the education system's strengths and weaknesses.  The use of PGI allows for comparative analysis and helps in identifying areas requiring improvement.


**9.  A significant report on India's aging population was recently released in collaboration between the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and a prominent Indian research institution. Which Indian research institution collaborated with UNFPA on this report?**

(a)  National Institute of Public Cooperation and Child Development (NIPCCD)
(b)  Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
(c)  International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
(d)  National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) collaborated with UNFPA on the India Ageing Report 2023.  IIPS is a leading research institution in India specializing in population studies, making it a natural partner for UNFPA in producing this report.  The other options, while important research institutions in India, do not have the same focus on population studies as IIPS.  NIPCCD works on child development, ICMR on medical research, and NCERT on educational research.  Therefore, option (c) correctly identifies the Indian research institution that partnered with UNFPA in preparing this report, which provides valuable insights into the demographic shifts and challenges associated with India's aging population.  This collaboration highlights the importance of international cooperation in addressing demographic trends.


**10.  Several agencies in India are responsible for the accreditation and ranking of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs).  Which of the following is NOT primarily involved in this process?**

(a)  University Grants Commission (UGC)
(b)  National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC)
(c)  National Medical Commission (NMC)
(d)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While NIRF is involved in ranking HEIs, it is not primarily an accreditation body.  NIRF provides rankings based on various parameters, but it doesn't grant accreditation.  The UGC is a regulatory body for higher education, NAAC is an accreditation agency, and the NMC regulates medical education.  Therefore, option (d) accurately identifies the entity that primarily focuses on ranking rather than accreditation, highlighting the difference between these two important processes in higher education quality assurance.  Understanding these distinctions is crucial for analyzing the landscape of higher education regulation and quality assessment in India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues, with detailed explanations:


**1.  Considering the socio-economic indicators used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), which of the following characteristics would LEAST likely be a defining factor for PVTG classification?**

(a)  High levels of literacy and access to formal education.
(b)  Dependence on pre-agricultural technologies for sustenance.
(c)  Significant economic backwardness and limited access to resources.
(d)  A declining or stagnant population growth rate.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because PVTGs are characterized by their pre-agricultural level of technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and declining or stagnant population.  High literacy and access to education directly contradict these defining features. PVTGs represent the most vulnerable segments within Scheduled Tribes, and their identification hinges on their limited access to modern advancements and significant socio-economic disadvantages.  Options (b), (c), and (d) all directly align with the established criteria for PVTG classification, emphasizing their vulnerability and dependence on traditional practices.  The inclusion of high literacy rates would indicate a level of social and economic progress incompatible with the designation of a PVTG.


**2.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently highlighted the need for a permanent commission for which specific group, emphasizing the implementation of a particular commission's recommendations?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b)  Scheduled Tribes (STs)
(c)  De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs)
(d)  Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NHRC's emphasis on implementing a commission's report regarding a permanent commission directly points to the De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs).  The passage specifically mentions the NHRC's call for implementing the Idate Commission report, which recommended establishing a permanent commission for DNTs.  While the other groups (SCs, STs, and PwDs) are also vulnerable and deserving of attention, the NHRC's specific focus in this instance is on the DNTs and their unique challenges stemming from their historical categorization and marginalization.  The question tests factual recall concerning recent NHRC pronouncements and their relevance to specific vulnerable groups.


**3. Which of the following government schemes is NOT primarily aimed at the economic empowerment or welfare of De-Notified Tribes (DNTs)?**

(a)  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls.
(b)  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme for construction of Hostels for DNTs Boys and Girls.
(c)  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED).
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK).

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) is a broad-based scheme focused on the empowerment of marginalized communities, but it is not exclusively targeted towards DNTs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are specifically designed to address the educational and economic needs of DNTs.  The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship program focuses on education, while the Nanaji Deshmukh scheme addresses housing needs, and the SEED scheme directly aims for economic empowerment.  Understanding the specific target beneficiaries of each scheme is crucial for answering this question correctly.  The question tests the ability to differentiate between schemes targeted at DNTs and broader schemes aimed at various marginalized groups.


**4. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates which of the following actions regarding government offices operating in inaccessible buildings?**

(a)  Immediate demolition of the inaccessible buildings.
(b)  Relocation of services to accessible locations within the same facility or to ground floors.
(c)  Mandatory provision of assistive technologies for all employees.
(d)  Financial compensation for employees facing accessibility challenges.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act focuses on ensuring accessibility for persons with disabilities.  The Act mandates that government offices operating from inaccessible buildings must relocate their services to accessible locations within the same facility or to ground floors.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are not explicitly mandated by the RPwD Act.  While assistive technologies and financial compensation may be beneficial, the primary focus of the Act in this context is to ensure physical accessibility of services.  This question tests knowledge of specific legal mandates related to disability rights and accessibility in public spaces.


**5.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects the legal status of manual scavenging in India?**

(a) It is a legally protected occupation under specific circumstances.
(b) It is completely legal if performed with appropriate safety gear.
(c) It is strictly prohibited under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR).
(d)  It is permitted in rural areas but prohibited in urban areas.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Manual scavenging is explicitly outlawed under the PEMSR Act of 2013. The act aims to eliminate the practice and rehabilitate those involved. While the use of protective gear might mitigate some risks, it doesn't legalize the practice itself.  The Act does not differentiate between rural and urban areas regarding the prohibition.  This question tests understanding of the legal framework surrounding manual scavenging and its implications. The inclusion of plausible distractors (options a and b) makes this a difficult question.


**6. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims primarily to achieve which of the following outcomes?**

(a) Increase the number of sanitation workers employed by municipalities.
(b)  Eliminate hazardous cleaning practices and prevent deaths of sewer and septic tank workers.
(c)  Promote the use of traditional sanitation methods in rural areas.
(d)  Privatize the sanitation sector to improve efficiency.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem is designed to address the hazardous working conditions faced by sanitation workers. The core objective is to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices and prevent deaths by promoting mechanization. Options (a), (c), and (d) are not the primary focus of this policy.

(a) Only at the national level.
(b) Only at the state level.
(c) At both the state and district levels.
(d) Only at the individual school level.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PGI assesses school education performance at both state and district levels, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the system's effectiveness.  The question tests understanding of the scope and application of the PGI.  The use of distractors emphasizing only one level of assessment makes it more challenging.



**8.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) proposes a shift from the traditional four-stage schooling structure to which new structure?**

(a) 3+3+3+3
(b) 4+4+4
(c) 5+3+3+4
(d) 6+3+3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE advocates for a 5+3+3+4 stage schooling structure aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.  This change aims to improve learning outcomes and adjust the curriculum to the developmental stages of children.  The question directly tests knowledge of the proposed curriculum changes.


**9. Which of the following is NOT a key feature of the National Credit Framework (NCrF)?**

(a)  Integration of credits from school, higher, and vocational education.
(b)  A rigid, inflexible system with limited opportunities for credit transfer.
(c)  Multiple entry and exit options for learners.
(d)  The use of a credit system to track learning across various educational pathways.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF is designed to create flexibility and mobility in education.  A rigid system is the opposite of the framework's core principles.  The other options accurately reflect the NCrF's goals.  This question tests understanding of the NCrF's philosophy and design.


**10.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, aims to subsume and replace which existing statutory body?**

(a) Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(c) Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(d) National Health Policy 2017


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme, formerly known as the Anganwadi Services Scheme, is explicitly designed to address the nutritional and health needs of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on broader health coverage, Mission Indradhanush targets immunization, and the National Health Policy 2017 sets overall health goals, but none are as directly focused on the specific population and objectives mentioned in the question.  The Anganwadi system, a cornerstone of this initiative, uses Anganwadi Centers (AWCs), Anganwadi Workers (AWWs), and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) to deliver services.


**2.  Which of the following acts primarily deals with the regulation and rehabilitation of individuals involved in the practice of manually removing human excreta?**

(a) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(b) The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016
(c) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(d) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, directly addresses the issue of manual scavenging, aiming to prevent the practice and rehabilitate those affected.  The other acts deal with different social issues: juvenile justice, disability rights, and surrogacy, respectively. The act also defines manual scavengers and outlines penalties for violations, including imprisonment and fines.  It further details the responsibilities of local authorities in identifying and rehabilitating manual scavengers.


**3.  A legal framework seeks to seamlessly integrate credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education, creating flexibility and mobility among these learning pathways.  This framework is known as:**

(a) National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(b) National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(c) National Curriculum Framework (NCF)
(d) National Credit Framework (NCrF)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is explicitly designed to integrate credits earned across various educational and skill-development pathways.  NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF are related frameworks, but they focus on specific aspects of the educational system—higher education qualifications, skill qualifications, and the overall curriculum, respectively.  The NCrF aims to create a more holistic and flexible educational system by allowing individuals to accumulate and transfer credits earned through different learning experiences, thereby promoting lifelong learning and career mobility.


**4.  A government report assesses the performance of the school education system at the state and district levels, using data from UDISE+ and NAS. This report uses a grading system that classifies states/UTs and districts into ten grades.  The report is known as:**

(a) National Family Health Survey (NFHS)
(b) Global Hunger Index (GHI)
(c) Performance Grading Index (PGI)
(d) National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Performance Grading Index (PGI) is precisely the report described in the question.  It uses data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) to assess school education performance and categorizes the performance into ten grades.  The other options—NFHS, GHI, and NIRF—are reports focusing on different aspects: family health, hunger levels, and higher education institutions' rankings, respectively. The PGI aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the school education system's strengths and weaknesses.


**5.  The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India are found in which state?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Jharkhand


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Odisha is explicitly stated in the text as housing the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh also have significant PVTG populations, Odisha holds the highest count.  The identification of PVTGs is based on criteria such as pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  Understanding the distribution of PVTGs is crucial for targeted interventions and welfare programs.


**6.  The  Ministry responsible for overseeing the welfare of Scheduled Tribes in India is:**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Panchayati Raj


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes in India.  While other ministries may have related responsibilities, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs holds the primary responsibility for policy formulation, implementation of welfare schemes, and overall oversight of tribal development.  This includes addressing issues related to PVTGs, land rights, education, and healthcare within tribal communities.


**7.  Which of the following organizations released the India Ageing Report 2023, in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c) UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(d) UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is explicitly mentioned as the organization that released the India Ageing Report 2023, in collaboration with IIPS.  The other organizations have different mandates: WFP focuses on food security, UNDESA on economic and social development, and UNCRC on children's rights. The report's findings provide valuable insights into India's demographic shift and the implications for policy and resource allocation.


**8.  The  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently stressed the need for implementing a report which recommended the establishment of a permanent commission for De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs) in India.  This report was issued by which commission?**

(a) Renke Commission
(b) Idate Commission
(c) Dhebar Commission
(d) Mandal Commission


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text specifically mentions the NHRC's call for implementing the Idate Commission's report concerning DNTs.  The Renke Commission dealt with nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes generally, the Dhebar Commission with tribal welfare more broadly, and the Mandal Commission with the classification of Other Backward Classes. The Idate Commission's recommendations are directly relevant to the NHRC's concern and the need for a permanent commission dedicated to the rights and welfare of DNTs.


**9.  Which of the following correctly describes the relationship between Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and Nomadic Tribes (NTs)?**

(a) All DNTs are NTs, but not all NTs are DNTs.
(b) All NTs are DNTs, but not all DNTs are NTs.
(c) DNTs and NTs are mutually exclusive categories.
(d) The terms DNTs and NTs are interchangeable.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that "All nomadic tribes (NTs) are not DNTs, but all DNTs are NTs." This clarifies that DNTs represent a subset of NTs, highlighting the complexities of these tribal communities' social classifications and the need for targeted policies and support.  Understanding this relationship is essential for effective social justice initiatives.


**10. Which of the following institutions was recently granted Deemed-to-be-University (DtbU) status, enabling it to offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees and granting it autonomy in program introduction, course structure, examinations, and management?**

(a) Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore
(b) National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
(c) University Grants Commission (UGC)
(d) All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly mentions that NCERT has recently been granted DtbU status, allowing it to offer its own degrees and enjoy greater autonomy in educational matters.  The other options are significant educational institutions but did not receive the DtbU status as described.  This development reflects the evolving landscape of higher education in India and the ongoing efforts to enhance the quality and reach of educational institutions.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and analysis.


**1.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) recently highlighted the need for the implementation of a specific commission's report concerning a vulnerable group in India.  Which commission's report is being referenced?**

(a) The Renke Commission Report
(b) The Idate Commission Report
(c) The Dhebar Commission Report
(d) The Mandal Commission Report

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the NHRC's call for the implementation of the Idate Commission report, which focuses on establishing a permanent commission for De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs) in India.  The Renke Commission dealt with nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, providing a different focus.  The Dhebar Commission's recommendations led to the recognition of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), while the Mandal Commission addressed the issue of Other Backward Classes (OBCs).  Therefore, only the Idate Commission report directly addresses the NHRC's concern regarding DNTs and the need for a permanent commission to safeguard their rights and welfare.  The significance lies in understanding the specific mandates of each commission and their relevance to different vulnerable groups within the Indian social structure.


**2.  Which state in India currently houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Jharkhand

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, Odisha holds the distinction of having the largest number of PVTGs, currently listed at 13.  Chhattisgarh shares some PVTGs with Madhya Pradesh, but neither state individually surpasses Odisha's count.  Jharkhand also has a significant tribal population but does not have the highest number of PVTGs.  The key here is understanding the difference between Scheduled Tribes (STs) as a broader category and PVTGs, which represent a particularly vulnerable subset within the ST population. This requires precise knowledge of the distribution of PVTGs across Indian states.


**3.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act) mandates certain accommodations for persons with disabilities in government offices.  Which of the following is NOT a mandate of the RPwD Act regarding government office accessibility?**

(a) Relocating services to the ground floor or accessible locations within the same facility.
(b) Providing mandatory sign language interpreters in all government offices.
(c) Ensuring that buildings are accessible to persons with disabilities.
(d) Implementing the Act's provisions in all government offices, regardless of their location or accessibility.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act emphasizes accessibility for persons with disabilities in government offices, including relocating services to accessible locations. It also aims for overall building accessibility. However, the Act doesn't specifically mandate sign language interpreters in *all* government offices; it focuses on broader accessibility measures.  While sign language interpretation is crucial for effective communication, it's not explicitly mandated across every government office as a universal requirement under the Act's current provisions.  Understanding the nuances of the Act's provisions is crucial to differentiating between its core mandates and supplementary accessibility improvements that might be recommended but aren't legally binding across all situations.


**4.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) aims to eliminate manual scavenging.  Which of the following is NOT explicitly an offense under this Act?**

(a) Employing individuals to clean sewers and septic tanks without protective gear.
(b) Constructing insanitary latrines.
(c) Failing to provide adequate wages to manual scavengers.
(d) Employing individuals as manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act focuses on preventing the employment of manual scavengers and the construction of insanitary latrines.  It criminalizes the use of individuals for hazardous cleaning tasks without proper safety equipment.  While fair wages are crucial for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, the Act's primary focus is on prohibiting the practice itself, not directly regulating wages.  The Act addresses the root cause—the employment of manual scavengers—rather than the broader socio-economic aspects of their compensation.  Distinguishing between the Act's core prohibitions and related socio-economic concerns that might be addressed through other legislation is critical for a comprehensive understanding of the PEMSR Act's scope.


**5.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) proposes a significant restructuring of the school education system. Which of the following is NOT a key feature of the proposed restructuring under the NCF-SE?**

(a)  A 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.
(b)  The introduction of a national-level standardized entrance examination for higher education.
(c)  Emphasis on multilingualism and proficiency in at least three languages.
(d)  Flexibility and choice at the secondary stage, blurring lines between academic and vocational subjects.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE advocates for a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure, promoting multilingualism, and offering flexibility in subject choices at the secondary level. However, it does *not* propose a national-level standardized entrance examination for higher education.  The NCF-SE focuses on curriculum reform within the school system itself, not on entrance examinations at the higher education level.  The other options accurately reflect the NCF-SE's key features.  Understanding the scope and limitations of the NCF-SE within the larger context of educational reforms in India is important.  It addresses the school curriculum, not the entrance examinations to higher educational institutions.


**6.  The National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, has implications for medical education and practice in India.  Which of the following is NOT a direct outcome of the NMC Act, 2019, or its subsequent actions?**

(a) The establishment of the NMC as a statutory body.
(b) The automatic WFME accreditation of all existing and new medical colleges for the next 10 years.
(c) The implementation of a National Exit Test for medical graduates.
(d) The repeal of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NMC Act, 2019, established the NMC, replacing the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956. The Act also paved the way for a National Exit Test.  While the NMC's actions resulted in the WFME recognition of medical colleges, it's not an automatic accreditation for all existing and new colleges for a decade.  The WFME accreditation is a separate process, though facilitated by the NMC's reforms.  Understanding the distinctions between the legal framework provided by the NMC Act and the subsequent actions and recognitions achieved through its implementation is crucial.


**7.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) report, released annually, uses several indicators to assess hunger levels. Which of the following is NOT a component of the GHI calculation?**

(a) Undernourishment
(b) Child stunting
(c) Adult mortality rate
(d) Child wasting

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The GHI uses undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality rate as its key indicators.  While adult mortality rates are important for overall public health assessments, they are not specifically included in the GHI calculation. The GHI focuses specifically on indicators directly related to child malnutrition and undernourishment, providing a focused measure of hunger levels.  Understanding the specific metrics used by the GHI is essential for accurate interpretation of its findings and avoiding conflation with other public health indicators.


**8.  The Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) aims to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status in villages across India.  Which of the following is a defining characteristic of an ODF Plus Model Village?**

(a)  Sustained ODF status.
(b)  Implementation of solid waste management systems only.
(c)  Absence of any visible stagnant water in public areas.
(d)  The presence of designated areas for livestock waste disposal.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** ODF Plus Model Villages must maintain sustained ODF status and implement systems for both solid and liquid waste management.  While minimal stagnant water is a desirable feature, it's not a defining criterion.  Designated areas for livestock waste are also beneficial but not explicitly mentioned as a defining characteristic of an ODF Plus Model Village.  The primary focus is on the sustained absence of open defecation and the implementation of comprehensive waste management systems.  Understanding the different levels of achievement within the Swachh Bharat Mission and their specific criteria is important for analyzing progress and identifying areas requiring further attention.


**9.  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) produces various reports on global population trends.  Which of the following reports is NOT regularly published by the UNFPA?**

(a) State of World Population Report
(b) Global Trends: Forced Displacement Report
(c) World Youth Report
(d) India Ageing Report

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNFPA regularly publishes the State of World Population Report and collaborates on reports like the India Ageing Report.  The World Youth Report is also related to UNFPA's mandate.  The Global Trends: Forced Displacement Report, however, is published by the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), not the UNFPA.  Each UN agency has a specific area of focus and it's important to distinguish between the mandates and publications of different UN organizations.


**10. The National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, aims to transform India's research landscape. Which of the following is NOT a direct function of the newly established Anusandhan NRF as per the Act?**

(a) Providing strategic direction for research in various scientific fields.
(b) Directly overseeing and managing individual research projects at universities.
(c) Promoting research, innovation, and entrepreneurship.
(d) Monitoring the implementation of its research objectives.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Anusandhan NRF provides strategic direction, promotes research and innovation, and monitors implementation.  However, it does not directly manage individual research projects at universities; its role is primarily to set the strategic direction and provide funding.  The NRF works through various mechanisms, providing grants and support but not directly managing individual research projects at the university level.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the NRF's role as a high-level strategic body rather than a direct operational manager of individual research projects.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring in-depth knowledge and careful analysis.


**1.  A recent Supreme Court judgment addressed the inclusion of certain children in the adoption pool.  Which category of children, based on their living situation and parental status, was the primary focus of this ruling?**

(a) Children living with extended family members who are unable to provide adequate care.
(b) Children residing in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) whose parents haven't visited them for over a year or are deemed "unfit."
(c) Children orphaned due to natural disasters or accidents.
(d) Children abandoned by parents due to severe financial hardship.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court's ruling in *Temple of Healing v. Union of India* specifically targeted children in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) whose parents hadn't visited them for over a year or were considered unfit due to factors like substance abuse, neglect, or criminal records.  Options (a), (c), and (d) represent other vulnerable groups of children, but they weren't the central focus of this particular judgment. The court emphasized the need to identify and bring these children in CCIs, whose parents have not visited them for over a year or have “unfit” parents or guardians, into the adoption pool. This highlights the judiciary's proactive role in ensuring the welfare of children within the existing institutional framework.  The judgment underscores the need for a collaborative effort between the judiciary, government agencies, and NGOs to expedite the adoption process for these children and provide them with stable and nurturing homes.


**2. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) advocates for a significant restructuring of school education. Which of the following is NOT a key feature of this restructuring?**

(a) A shift from the existing four-stage schooling structure to a 5+3+3+4 design based on age groups.
(b) The introduction of a comprehensive national assessment center to evaluate student performance.
(c) The elimination of board examinations for Grades 10 and 12.
(d) An emphasis on multilingualism, encouraging proficiency in at least three languages, with a focus on Indian languages.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE does propose a shift to a 5+3+3+4 structure and the establishment of a national assessment center (PARAKH).  It also strongly emphasizes multilingualism. However, it does *not* eliminate board examinations for Grades 10 and 12; instead, it allows students to take these exams on at least two occasions during the school year, retaining the best score. This reflects an attempt to reduce the high-stakes pressure associated with these exams while maintaining a system for evaluating student achievement at key transition points.  The flexibility offered by allowing multiple attempts aims to address the stress and anxiety often experienced by students, promoting a more supportive and holistic learning environment.


**3.  The 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report generated controversy. Which of the following best describes the core of India's objection to the report's findings?**

(a) The report's methodology underestimates India's progress in reducing hunger.
(b) The report unfairly compares India to developed nations with vastly different socioeconomic contexts.
(c) The report's data sources are unreliable and do not accurately reflect the nutritional status of the Indian population.
(d) The report ignores the government's efforts to alleviate hunger through various welfare programs.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Indian government's primary objection to the GHI report centers on its perceived methodological flaws and the reliability of its data sources.  While the government acknowledges challenges in reducing hunger, it disputes the report's methodology and the accuracy of its data, arguing that they do not fully capture the complexities of the Indian situation and the impact of various government initiatives.  While points (a) and (d) are related concerns, the core of the objection is the credibility of the data and methodology used, impacting the validity of the conclusions drawn.  Option (b) is less central to the Indian government's stated concerns.  The government's response reflects a larger debate on the measurement of hunger and the challenges of using global indices to assess complex, nation-specific situations.


**4. The National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, established a new organization to guide research in India.  Which previously existing organization was subsumed into the NRF under this act?**

(a) The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)
(b) The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)
(c) The Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
(d) The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NRF Act, 2023, specifically repealed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008, and integrated the SERB into the newly formed NRF. The SERB was previously responsible for funding and promoting basic research in science and engineering. This integration reflects a strategic shift towards a more centralized and coordinated approach to research funding and management in India. The other organizations mentioned (ICAR, CSIR, and DRDO) remain independent entities with their own mandates and funding structures.  The absorption of SERB into NRF highlights the government's aim for more effective resource allocation and collaborative research endeavors in science and technology.


**5.  Several international organizations released reports related to social issues in India in recent years. Which of the following correctly pairs an organization with a key report it published?**

(c) The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR): India Ageing Report 2023
(d) The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI): Global Food Policy Report 2023

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is correctly paired with its publication, the Global Food Policy Report 2023.  The other pairings are incorrect. The UNHCR published the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022" report, the UNFPA released the "India Ageing Report 2023", and the UNDESA released the "Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023".  This question tests knowledge of key international organizations and their areas of expertise concerning social development and global issues. The correct pairing reflects the IFPRI's focus on food security and policy analysis, highlighting the relevance of its research in addressing global hunger and malnutrition.

(c) Spain
(d) United Kingdom

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The passage explicitly mentions Spain as the first European country to implement a paid menstrual leave policy for its workers. This highlights the growing global recognition of menstruation as a significant aspect of women's health and well-being, and the need for policies that support their needs. The policy reflects a broader shift towards addressing gender equality and promoting a more inclusive workplace environment.  The inclusion of this information underscores the international context of menstrual hygiene management and the need for policies that address the issue in diverse settings.


**7. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), mandates certain accommodations. Which sector, according to a recent court ruling, is required to implement the RPwD Act's accessibility provisions, even for foreign operators?**

(a)  Higher education institutions.
(b)  Government offices.
(c)  The airline industry.
(d)  Healthcare facilities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** A recent court ruling emphasized that all airlines operating in India, both domestic and international, must adhere to the accessibility provisions of the RPwD Act. This ruling underscores the importance of ensuring equal access to air travel for persons with disabilities.  The court's decision extends the reach of the RPwD Act beyond national borders, highlighting the global implications of disability rights and the need for inclusive practices across all sectors.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are also covered under the RPwD Act, but the court ruling specifically highlighted the airline industry's obligations.


**8.  The  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), aims to eliminate a harmful practice.  What specific action is considered a violation of this Act, even if performed by an individual employed by a private organization?**

(a) Cleaning of drains with appropriate protective gear.
(b) Removal of human excreta from insanitary latrines by hand.
(c)  Maintenance of community sanitary latrines.
(d)  Construction of sanitary latrines in accordance with building codes.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act explicitly prohibits the employment of individuals for the manual removal of human excreta from insanitary latrines, regardless of the employer (government or private).  This highlights the seriousness of the issue and the legal consequences of engaging in this practice.  Options (a), (c), and (d) represent actions that are either permitted or encouraged under the Act, emphasizing the focus on eliminating the hazardous practice of manual scavenging and rehabilitating those involved.  The act's broad applicability underscores the government's commitment to eradicating this harmful practice and promoting safe sanitation practices nationwide.


**1.  Which entity is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), ensuring accessibility in government offices and mandating compliance from airlines?**

(a)  Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(b)  National Human Rights Commission
(c)  Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD
(d)  Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Office of Chief Commissioner of PwD, established under the RPwD Act, 2016, plays a crucial role in safeguarding the rights of persons with disabilities.  Its landmark judgments highlight its authority to mandate accessibility in government buildings and enforce compliance from airlines, both domestic and international.  The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment has overall responsibility for the welfare of PwDs, but the Chief Commissioner's office holds specific enforcement powers under the Act. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs focuses on tribal welfare, and the NHRC addresses broader human rights issues.


**2. Which of the following groups, characterized by frequent seasonal movement for livelihood, are NOT always categorized as Denotified Tribes (DNTs), but all DNTs are included within this broader classification?**

(a)  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(b)  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes
(c)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(d)  Other Backward Castes (OBCs)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes represent a larger group encompassing diverse communities with varying livelihood strategies.  While Denotified Tribes are a subset of this group, historically labeled as "criminal tribes" during the British Raj, not all nomadic communities fall under the DNT category.  PVTGs are a specific category within Scheduled Tribes, while SCs and OBCs are distinct social classifications based on different criteria.


**3.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) primarily aims to achieve which of the following objectives?**

(a)  Oversee the implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006.
(b)  Prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
(c)  Monitor the implementation of the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan).
(d)  Provide free competitive exam coaching to DNTs students.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCDNT's core mandate is to create a comprehensive, state-wise inventory of castes identified as Denotified Tribes. This crucial task is fundamental to understanding the demographic distribution of DNTs and formulating targeted welfare policies. While other options address important social issues, they are not the primary focus of the NCDNT.  The Forest Rights Act is related to tribal land rights, POSHAN Abhiyan focuses on nutrition, and free coaching is a separate initiative under the SEED scheme.


**4. Which of the following accurately describes the criteria used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  High literacy rates and advanced agricultural practices.
(b)  Significant economic prosperity and a rapidly growing population.
(c)  Pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
(d)  Exclusive residence in urban areas and engagement in modern industries.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** PVTGs are identified based on their vulnerability, characterized by pre-agricultural technological levels, low literacy rates, substantial economic backwardness, and population trends that are either stagnant or declining. These factors collectively point to a high degree of marginalization and vulnerability.  Options (a), (b), and (d) directly contradict the established criteria for identifying PVTGs.


**5.  According to the provided information, which state in India has the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  Madhya Pradesh
(b)  Chhattisgarh
(c)  Andaman and Nicobar Islands
(d)  Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Odisha is explicitly mentioned as housing the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, Odisha holds the distinction of having the largest number of PVTGs among the states and union territories.  Chhattisgarh shares some PVTGs with Madhya Pradesh, but neither has the highest overall number.


**6. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, primarily aims to prevent manual scavenging by which of the following means?**

(a)  Encouraging the continued use of insanitary latrines.
(b)  Promoting the employment of manual scavengers without protective gear.
(c)  Demolishing insanitary latrines and constructing community sanitary latrines.
(d)  Ignoring the issue of rehabilitation for manual scavengers.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Act directly addresses the root cause of manual scavenging by mandating the demolition of insanitary latrines and the construction of safe, sanitary alternatives.  This eliminates the need for hazardous manual cleaning. Options (a) and (b) directly contradict the Act’s objectives.  Option (d) ignores the crucial rehabilitation component of the Act.


**7. Which Ministry is the nodal authority for the implementation of the National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem, aiming to eliminate hazardous cleaning and ensure the safety and dignity of sanitation workers?**

(a) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(b) Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
(c) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(d) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, in conjunction with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, is the driving force behind the National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme, which is a key part of the National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem.  This policy directly addresses the issues of hazardous sanitation work. The other ministries have different primary responsibilities.


**8. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) seeks to achieve which of the following primary goals?**

(a)  Restrict educational mobility and limit credit transfer opportunities.
(b)  Create a fragmented system of credits, hindering the integration of learning pathways.
(c)  Integrate credits earned through various educational and vocational pathways, promoting flexibility and mobility.
(d)  Discourage lifelong learning by establishing rigid educational structures.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF's core objective is to create a seamless system for accumulating and transferring credits earned through diverse educational and vocational routes. This enhances flexibility, allowing individuals to move between different learning pathways and pursue lifelong learning. Options (a), (b), and (d) contradict the fundamental principles and aims of the NCrF.

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNFPA, in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), is explicitly credited with releasing the India Ageing Report 2023.  The other organizations focus on different areas: food security (WFP, IFPRI), and refugee issues (UNHCR).

(a) Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report
(b) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023
(c) Global Food Policy Report 2023
(d) Triple Threat Report by UNICEF

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The UNICEF's "Triple Threat Report" specifically analyzes the combined challenges of WASH-related threats to children, including limited access to services, high mortality rates associated with unsafe WASH, and the heightened vulnerability due to climate and environmental hazards.  The other reports focus on different aspects of global development challenges.


**11. Which of the following is NOT a key dimension of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), as described in the provided text?**

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c) Availability of Specialized Treatments Only
(d) Quality

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  UHC emphasizes accessibility, affordability, and quality of health services across the board.  The focus is on comprehensive care, not just specialized treatments.  The availability of specialized treatments is important within the context of UHC, but it's not a defining dimension in the way accessibility, affordability, and quality are.


**12. The  Anganwadi system,  a cornerstone of which  scheme, primarily aims to improve the nutritional and health status of which population groups?**

(a)  The elderly population
(b)  Students in higher education
(c)  Children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers

(a)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b)  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(c)  The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d)  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, directly repealed the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, removing the discriminatory labeling of certain communities as "criminal tribes."  The other acts address different aspects of social justice and human rights.


**14. The  National  Family  Health  Survey-5 (NFHS-5)  report  provides  data  on  various  health  indicators. Which  ministry is primarily responsible for the release and dissemination of this report?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(c) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(d) Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is the primary agency responsible for the National Family Health Survey and the release of its reports.  The other ministries have different areas of focus.


**15. Which  organization  is  responsible  for  releasing  the  Global  Hunger  Index (GHI),  providing  an  assessment  of  hunger levels across countries?**

(a) World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c) Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
(d) International Monetary Fund (IMF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, two non-governmental organizations, are explicitly named as the publishers of the Global Hunger Index (GHI) report. The other organizations have different mandates.



**1.  Which framework seamlessly integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, aiming for flexibility and mobility among them?**

(a) National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(b) National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(c) National Credit Framework (NCrF)
(d) National Curriculum Framework (NCF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is explicitly designed to integrate credits from various educational pathways—school, higher education, and vocational training—to facilitate smoother transitions and lifelong learning.  The NSQF focuses solely on vocational skills, NHEQF on higher education, and NCF on school curricula.  Therefore, only the NCrF addresses the comprehensive integration of credits across these diverse educational streams, enabling students to accumulate credits regardless of their chosen path and transfer them seamlessly between institutions and levels of education.  This holistic approach promotes flexibility and mobility within the education system, allowing individuals to tailor their educational journey to their specific needs and aspirations.


**2.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) divides education into how many levels, encompassing school, higher, and vocational education?**

(a) 6
(b) 7
(c) 8
(d) 10

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF organizes the entire educational spectrum into eight distinct levels.  This structured approach allows for a clear and consistent framework for credit accumulation and transfer.  Levels 1-4 correspond to school education, levels 4.5-8 to higher education, and vocational education and training are integrated across all eight levels. This 8-level structure provides a comprehensive and integrated approach to credit accumulation, reflecting the policy's goal of creating a seamless and flexible learning experience for all students, regardless of their entry point or educational trajectory.  Options (a), (b), and (d) do not reflect the actual number of levels defined by the NCrF.


**3. Which committee's recommendations led to the Ministry of Education's acceptance of reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions?**

(a) The National Steering Committee
(b) The Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs)
(c) Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee
(d) The Parliamentary Standing Committee on education, women, children, youth, and sports

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The reforms in the accreditation system for Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) were directly based on the recommendations of the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee.  This committee was specifically tasked with strengthening assessment and accreditation processes and outlining a roadmap for the National Accreditation Council (NAC), envisioned under the NEP 2020. While other committees (National Steering Committee, Parliamentary Standing Committee) played roles in education reforms, they did not specifically focus on HEI accreditation system reform. The IAEG-SDGs deals with Sustainable Development Goals and is not related to HEI accreditation.  Thus, the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee stands out as the key driver of the accepted accreditation system reforms.


**4.  What is the name of the body envisioned as the 'meta-accrediting body' overseeing and supervising an independent ecosystem of accrediting institutions, as part of the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI)?**

(a) University Grants Commission (UGC)
(b) National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET)
(c) National Accreditation Council (NAC)
(d)  National Assessment Centre, PARAKH

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Accreditation Council (NAC) is specifically designed within the HECI framework to function as the overarching body responsible for overseeing and regulating the accreditation process for Higher Educational Institutions.  The UGC is a broader regulatory body for higher education, NABET focuses on accreditation for education and training, and PARAKH is an assessment centre, not an accreditation body.  The NAC's role is unique in its meta-accrediting function, ensuring the quality and consistency of accreditation provided by various accrediting institutions within the system.  This hierarchical structure promotes accountability and transparency within the HEI accreditation landscape.


**5.  Which organization released the 8th edition of India Rankings of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in 2023, based on the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)?**

(a)  World Economic Forum
(b)  United Nations Development Programme
(c)  Ministry of Education
(d)  Times Higher Education

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Education is responsible for releasing the annual India Rankings of HEIs, which are based on the NIRF framework.  The World Economic Forum produces the Global Gender Gap Index, the UNDP releases the Gender Social Norms Index, and Times Higher Education publishes its own world university rankings.  The Ministry of Education's role in this context is clearly stated in the provided text, making it the only correct answer.  The NIRF rankings are a significant indicator of the quality and performance of Indian HEIs and are a key component of the country's higher education landscape.


**6. Which Act, enacted to improve quality education in the paramedical sector (including nurses and midwives), seeks to repeal the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947?**

(a) National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019
(b) National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023
(c) National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023
(d)  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023, is specifically designed to overhaul the regulatory framework for nursing and midwifery education and training in India.  A key component of this reform is the repeal of the outdated Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947. The NMC Act focuses on medical education, the NDC Act on dental education, and the Surrogacy Act is unrelated to the paramedical sector.  The NNMC Act aims to address significant shortcomings in the nursing and midwifery sectors, such as the shortage of nursing colleges in many districts and the low nurse-to-population ratio, by establishing a more effective and modern regulatory body.


**7. The National Medical Commission (NMC) received recognition status for how many years from the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME)?**

(a) 5 years
(b) 10 years
(c) 15 years
(d) 20 years

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NMC secured a 10-year recognition status from the WFME. This recognition is significant because it ensures that all existing and newly established medical colleges in India will automatically meet WFME accreditation standards for the next decade. This will enhance the international recognition and credibility of medical education in India.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect, as they do not reflect the actual duration of the WFME recognition granted to the NMC.


**8.  Which organization, in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), released the India Ageing Report 2023?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(c) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The India Ageing Report 2023 was a joint publication of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the IIPS.  The WFP focuses on food security, UNDESA on broader economic and social development, and NCPCR on child rights.  The UNFPA's mandate includes addressing population dynamics and demographic trends, making its involvement in this report entirely consistent with its core functions.  The report provides valuable insights into the aging population in India and its implications for social and economic planning.


**9.  Which committee's report, according to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), needs implementation to establish a permanent commission for De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs) in India?**

(a) Renke Commission
(b) Idate Commission
(c)  U.N. Dhebar Commission
(d)  Mandal Commission

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NHRC specifically highlighted the need to implement the recommendations of the Idate Commission concerning the establishment of a permanent commission for DNTs.  The Renke Commission dealt with nomadic tribes, the U.N. Dhebar Commission with tribal welfare more broadly, and the Mandal Commission with OBCs.  The Idate Commission's report, therefore, holds a unique and direct relevance to the NHRC's call for a dedicated commission to address the specific concerns and needs of DNTs in India.  The creation of such a commission would be a significant step towards ensuring the protection and empowerment of these marginalized communities.


**10. Which act,  banned under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), carries a punishment of imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both?**

(a) Employing people to clean sewers without protective gear.
(b) Constructing insanitary latrines.
(c)  Failing to demolish insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.
(d) All of the above.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act criminalizes various actions related to manual scavenging, including employing individuals to clean sewers or septic tanks without proper safety equipment, constructing insanitary latrines, and failing to demolish or convert insanitary latrines as mandated by the Act.  Each of these actions carries the specified penalty.  The Act aims to completely eradicate the practice of manual scavenging, a dangerous and dehumanizing occupation, by making it illegal and providing rehabilitation opportunities for those previously engaged in it.  The comprehensive approach to penalizing various aspects of the practice underscores the seriousness with which the government views this issue.



**1.  Which legislative act in India governs the adoption of children, encompassing both inter-country and intra-country adoptions, and also specifies the roles of various agencies involved in the process?**

(a) Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA), 1956
(b) Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c) Guardians and Wards Act, 1890
(d) Special Marriage Act, 1954


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, along with the Adoption Regulations, 2022, is the primary legislation governing adoption in India.  It outlines the procedures for both inter-country and intra-country adoptions of orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered children, and children of relatives.  The Act establishes a framework involving various agencies, including the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), State Adoption Resource Agencies (SARAs), District Child Welfare Committees, and Specialized Adoption Agencies (SAAs).  These agencies play crucial roles in identifying eligible children, assessing prospective adoptive parents, and facilitating the legal process of adoption.  While the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, deals with adoption within the Hindu community, it doesn't cover the broader spectrum of adoptions as encompassed by the JJ Act, 2015.  The other options are irrelevant to the legal framework for child adoption.


**2.  Which organization is responsible for preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in India?**

(a) National Commission for Scheduled Castes
(b) National Commission for Scheduled Tribes
(c) National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)
(d) National Commission for Backward Classes


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is specifically mandated to work on issues related to DNTs.  Its key functions include preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to these communities.  The other commissions mentioned focus on different marginalized groups—Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes—and do not have the specific responsibility of compiling a state-wise list of DNT castes.  The NCDNT's role is crucial in identifying and addressing the specific needs and challenges faced by DNT communities, which often remain invisible in broader caste-based classifications.


**3. Which Act in India prohibits the employment of children below a specific age in all types of employment and also restricts the employment of adolescents in hazardous occupations?**

(a) The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929
(b) The Right to Education Act, 2009
(c) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(d) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, explicitly prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all forms of employment.  It further restricts the employment of adolescents (aged 14-18) in specified hazardous occupations and processes.  While the other options address related issues concerning children, they do not directly address the prohibition and regulation of child labour in the comprehensive manner provided by the 2016 Amendment Act.  The Right to Education Act focuses on the right to education, the Child Marriage Restraint Act targets child marriages, and the Juvenile Justice Act deals with the care and protection of children in conflict with the law.


**4. Which international treaty, though not yet ratified by India, recognizes the right of every individual to a world of work free from violence and harassment, including gender-based violence and harassment?**

(a) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(b) The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)
(c) The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)
(d) The ILO Convention 190


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The ILO Convention 190 is the first international treaty to explicitly acknowledge the right of all individuals to a workplace free from violence and harassment, encompassing gender-based violence and harassment.  While the other conventions listed address various human rights, they don't specifically focus on the elimination of violence and harassment in the workplace.  India's non-ratification of Convention 190 highlights a significant gap in the country's legal framework to comprehensively address workplace harassment, despite existing laws like the POSH Act. The significance of ILO Convention 190 lies in its global recognition of this crucial right and the call for its implementation worldwide.


**5. Which of the following acts was repealed by the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, leading to a restructuring of provisions related to causing the miscarriage of women?**

(a) The Indian Penal Code, 1860
(b) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(c) The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971
(d) The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, replaces the Indian Penal Code, 1860.  Sections 88 to 92 of the BNS now contain the provisions related to causing the miscarriage of women, replacing the relevant sections of the IPC.  The other acts mentioned are not directly replaced or repealed by the BNS.  The BNS represents a significant legislative reform, aiming to modernize and streamline the criminal justice system in India, with changes impacting various areas of law, including those related to women's reproductive rights. The repeal of the IPC and its replacement with the BNS marks a key shift in the legal landscape of India.


**6. Which of the following is a centrally recognized special category among Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India, initially identified in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) and later renamed in 2006?**

(a) Other Backward Classes (OBCs)
(b) Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(c) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(d) Nomadic Tribes (NTs)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) are a special category within the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India.  They were initially designated as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973, based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961).  The government renamed them PVTGs in 2006.  PVTGs are characterized by their pre-agricultural level of technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and often declining or stagnant populations.  The identification of PVTGs reflects the government's recognition of the unique vulnerabilities and challenges faced by these groups and the need for targeted interventions for their development and protection.  The other options represent other marginalized groups in India but not a specifically designated sub-category within STs.


**7. Which Supreme Court case led to the direction for states and union territories to conduct a bi-monthly drive to identify children in the Orphaned-Abandoned-Surrendered (OAS) category in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) and bring them into the adoption pool?**

(a)  Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan
(b)  Shayara Bano v. Union of India
(c)  Temple of Healing v. Union of India
(d)  Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court judgment in *Temple of Healing v. Union of India* highlighted the need for proactive measures to address the large number of children in CCIs who are eligible for adoption but remain in institutional care.  The court's direction to conduct bi-monthly drives to identify OAS children and ensure their registration on the CARINGS portal underscores the urgency to expedite the adoption process and provide these children with permanent homes.  The other cases mentioned are landmark judgments addressing significant legal issues but are not directly related to the identification and adoption of OAS children.  The *Temple of Healing* case specifically focused on improving the adoption system and reducing the number of children languishing in institutional settings.


**8.  Which Ministry is the nodal agency for the Prayatna project, a livelihood and enterprise training program for transgender people in Delhi-NCR, approved by the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) Executive Committee?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Minority Affairs
(c) Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE)
(d) Ministry of Women and Child Development


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), through its implementing agency, the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), serves as the nodal agency for the Prayatna project.  The project aims to enhance the livelihoods and entrepreneurial capabilities of transgender individuals.  While other ministries address the concerns of marginalized communities, the MSDE's involvement highlights the importance of skill development and entrepreneurship as crucial components of social and economic inclusion for transgender people.  The Prayatna project is a significant initiative aimed at empowering transgender individuals through skill-building and entrepreneurial opportunities.


**9. Which Act in India, enacted in 2013, aims to prevent manual scavenging and rehabilitate those engaged in this hazardous practice?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR)
(c) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976
(d) The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), specifically targets the elimination of manual scavenging and the rehabilitation of those involved in it.  It criminalizes the practice and mandates the construction of sanitary latrines to replace insanitary ones.  The Act also provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment opportunities, financial assistance, and property acquisition support.  While the other options address related issues of social justice, they don't directly focus on the specific problem of manual scavenging and its eradication.  The PEMSR Act is a crucial piece of legislation in addressing a deeply entrenched social issue.


**10. Which high-level committee, established in 2021, was tasked with developing a National Credit Accumulation and Transfer Framework for both General and Vocational Education and Training/skilling, as envisioned by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020?**

(a) Kasturirangan Committee
(b) Yashpal Committee
(c) The High-Level Committee on the National Credit Framework (NCrF)
(d) Kothari Commission


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The High-Level Committee on the National Credit Framework (NCrF) was specifically constituted to develop a unified credit framework integrating school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education.  The committee comprised members from various relevant organizations, including the UGC, AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, and ministries of education and skill development.  The NEP 2020's emphasis on credit-based systems necessitates such a framework for seamless credit transfer across different educational pathways.  The other committees and commissions mentioned dealt with different aspects of education but not the specific development of a unified credit framework.  The NCrF committee's work is pivotal in implementing the NEP 2020's vision of flexible and integrated learning pathways.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test various cognitive skills, with a detailed explanation for the correct answer and analysis of the incorrect options.


**1.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 mandates the establishment of Internal Committees (ICs) in workplaces. Which of the following entities is NOT authorized to file a complaint on behalf of a woman who is physically or mentally incapacitated, deceased, or otherwise unable to file a complaint herself, according to the Act's subsequent notification?**

(a) A close relative of the aggrieved woman
(b) A friend of the aggrieved woman
(c) A coworker of the aggrieved woman
(d) A representative from the employer's legal department


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Act, through a subsequent government notification, explicitly lists relatives, friends, and coworkers as authorized to file complaints on behalf of an incapacitated, deceased, or otherwise unable woman.  However, a representative from the employer's legal department is not specifically mentioned and would not be considered an appropriate neutral party in such a sensitive matter.  The notification aims to ensure the complaint process is accessible and protects the victim's rights, while also maintaining a degree of impartiality.  The inclusion of friends and coworkers reflects a practical understanding that colleagues may be the first to observe signs of harassment and be in a position to assist.  The employer's legal department, on the other hand, represents the interests of the employer, potentially creating a conflict of interest.  This highlights the Act's focus on providing avenues for redressal outside of direct employer influence.


**2. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, as amended in 2021, significantly altered the handling of juvenile offenders. What key change did the 2021 amendment introduce concerning the appeals process related to adoption orders?**

(a)  Appeals against Child Welfare Committee orders were removed entirely.
(b)  Appeals can now be made to the High Court instead of the Divisional Commissioner.
(c) Appeals can now be made to the Divisional Commissioner within 30 days of the adoption order.
(d)  The amendment introduced a new appeals process involving the Supreme Court.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 2015 Act initially lacked an appeals process for Child Welfare Committee adoption orders. The 2021 amendment introduced a right of appeal to the Divisional Commissioner within 30 days of the order. This provides a crucial mechanism for redressal if there are concerns about the fairness or legality of an adoption decision. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they misrepresent the changes introduced. Option (d) is incorrect because the amendment did not involve the Supreme Court directly in the appeals process for adoption orders.  The inclusion of this appeals process reflects a commitment to due process and transparency in child adoption procedures.


**3. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced a crucial change regarding the use of donor gametes in surrogacy procedures.  What specific aspect of donor gamete use is now permitted under these amended rules?**

(a)  Commercial surrogacy using donor gametes is now permitted.
(b)  The use of donor gametes is permitted only if the child has at least one gamete from the intending couple.
(c)  Donor gametes can be used irrespective of the intending couple's medical condition.
(d)  The use of donor gametes is exclusively permitted for single women.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The amended rules explicitly allow the use of donor gametes under specific circumstances:  the intending couple must have a medical condition necessitating their use, and the resulting child must have at least one gamete from the intending couple. This maintains the ethical principle of altruistic surrogacy while acknowledging the medical realities faced by some intending parents. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect because commercial surrogacy remains prohibited, and the use of donor gametes is not unrestricted. Option (d) is incorrect because while single women can utilize surrogacy, the use of donor gametes is not exclusively restricted to them. The amendment reflects a nuanced approach to surrogacy, balancing ethical considerations with the needs of intending parents.



**4.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to integrate various educational pathways. Which of the following aspects is NOT a key objective of the NCrF?**

(a)  Creating a seamless credit transfer mechanism across school, higher education, and vocational training.
(b)  Establishing a rigid structure to prevent students from switching educational paths.
(c)  Developing a system for storing academic credits earned through diverse learning experiences.
(d)  Enabling lifelong learning through multiple entry and exit points in the educational system.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCrF's core principle is flexibility and mobility.  It aims to create a system where credits earned through diverse learning pathways can be easily transferred and accumulated, allowing students to tailor their education to their needs and aspirations. Option (b) directly contradicts this principle. Options (a), (c), and (d) all accurately reflect the NCrF's goals. The NCrF's emphasis on flexibility is a critical aspect of its design, aligning with the goals of lifelong learning and personalized education.


**5.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates certain accommodations for persons with disabilities in various sectors. Which of the following is NOT a direct mandate of this Act?**

(a)  A minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities.
(b)  Free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18.
(c)  Establishment of special courts in each district for faster adjudication of cases under the Act.
(d)  Mandatory provision of sign language interpreters in all government offices.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** While the Act promotes accessibility and inclusion, it doesn't specifically mandate sign language interpreters in *all* government offices.  The Act focuses on broader accessibility measures, but the specific provision of sign language interpreters would fall under the implementation guidelines and resource availability of individual offices. Options (a), (b), and (c) are directly mandated by the Act.  The lack of specific mention of sign language interpreters in every office highlights the practical challenges of implementing comprehensive accessibility across all government entities.


**6. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5 report provides data on various health indicators. Which of the following is NOT a key parameter typically included in NFHS reports?**

(a)  Maternal mortality rate
(b)  Total fertility rate
(c)  Prevalence of infectious diseases
(d)  National Gross Domestic Product (GDP)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** NFHS reports focus on health and family welfare indicators. GDP is an economic indicator, not directly related to the health and well-being parameters typically measured by the NFHS.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all key indicators consistently included in NFHS reports to assess the health status of the population. The exclusion of GDP underscores the survey's specific focus on health-related data.


**7. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) assesses the state of hunger in different countries. Which of the following is NOT a key component typically used in the GHI calculation?**

(a)  Prevalence of undernourishment
(b)  Child wasting
(c)  Child stunting
(d)  Adult literacy rate


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The GHI focuses on nutrition-related indicators of hunger. Adult literacy rate, while important for overall development, is not a direct component of the GHI calculation.  The GHI uses undernourishment, child wasting, and child stunting to provide a comprehensive picture of hunger's impact on a population. The exclusion of literacy highlights the GHI's specific focus on nutritional aspects of hunger.


**8.  The  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) focuses on several key areas. Which of the following is NOT a primary goal of UNFPA as stated in the provided text?**

(a)  Ending unmet needs for family planning
(b)  Ending preventable maternal deaths
(c)  Ending gender-based violence and harmful practices
(d)  Achieving universal primary education


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** While UNFPA's work indirectly contributes to improved education, its explicitly stated primary goals are focused on reproductive health, maternal health, and gender-based violence. Universal primary education is a broader development goal addressed by other UN agencies.  The omission of universal primary education highlights the organization's targeted focus on sexual and reproductive health and rights.


**9.  The  World Food Programme (WFP) operates in numerous countries, including India. What is NOT a primary activity of the WFP in India, as mentioned in the text?**

(a)  Piloting innovative solutions for food distribution, such as automated grain dispensers.
(b)  Supporting the government's efforts in establishing state-level food security analysis units.
(c)  Implementing large-scale agricultural development programs to boost food production.
(d)  Fortifying government-distributed food, such as school meals.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** While WFP works to improve food security, its direct involvement in large-scale agricultural development programs in India isn't mentioned in the provided text.  Its activities focus on efficient food distribution, monitoring, and fortification of existing programs.  The absence of large-scale agricultural development programs highlights WFP's specific role in supplemental food assistance and support for existing government initiatives rather than direct agricultural production.


**10. The  National Medical Commission (NMC) recently received recognition from the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME). What is a direct consequence of this recognition for existing medical colleges in India?**

(a)  All existing medical colleges will immediately be eligible for government funding.
(b)  Existing medical colleges will automatically receive increased student enrollment quotas.
(c) All existing medical colleges will become WFME accredited.
(d)  Existing medical colleges must undergo a separate accreditation process.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The WFME recognition grants automatic accreditation to all existing medical colleges in India. This simplifies the accreditation process and ensures a higher standard of medical education. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they are not direct consequences of the WFME recognition. The automatic accreditation highlights the significant impact of the WFME recognition on the Indian medical education system.



**1.  Which legislative act in India addresses the issue of prohibiting the employment of children below 14 years of age in all forms of employment, while also including provisions for the prohibition of adolescent employment (14-18 years) in specified hazardous occupations and processes?**

(a) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976
(b) The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956
(c) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
(d) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, is the primary legislation in India that directly addresses the issue of child labor.  It explicitly prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all types of employment.  Furthermore, it extends its reach to adolescents aged 14-18, prohibiting their employment in scheduled hazardous occupations and processes.  This comprehensive approach distinguishes it from other acts focused on specific aspects of child protection, such as the POCSO Act (sexual offenses), the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (sex trafficking), and the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act (bonded labor). The 2016 amendment significantly strengthened existing legislation to combat child labor effectively.  The other options deal with different, albeit related, social issues concerning children and vulnerable populations, but don't directly address the broad prohibition of child labor as comprehensively as the 2016 Act.


**2. Which Indian Act defines a "child" as an individual who has not yet completed 18 years of age, and notably introduced a provision allowing for the trial of 16-18-year-olds as adults in cases involving heinous offenses?**

(a) The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956
(b) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
(d) The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, fundamentally alters the legal definition and treatment of juveniles in India.  While the age of majority remains 18, a crucial amendment introduced a mechanism to try children aged 16-18 as adults if accused of heinous crimes. This provision significantly impacts the juvenile justice system, introducing a critical distinction between the treatment of juveniles based on the severity of the offense. The other options focus on different legal frameworks within India. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act deals with adoption within the Hindu community. The Surrogacy and ART Acts regulate assisted reproductive technologies and surrogacy practices.  These acts don't address the core issue of juvenile justice and the unique provisions for trying older juveniles as adults in specific circumstances.


**3.  Which organization released the "India Ageing Report 2023", offering insights into demographic trends and the challenges associated with an aging population in India?**

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d) World Food Programme (WFP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), is responsible for the publication of the "India Ageing Report 2023." This report focuses specifically on India's demographic transition and the implications of a growing elderly population.  The UNFPA's mandate includes addressing population issues and promoting reproductive health, making this report a logical output of its work. The other organizations, while involved in global development and humanitarian efforts, do not have a primary focus on demographic trends and aging populations in India.  UNDESA deals with broader economic and social development, UNHCR focuses on refugee issues, and WFP addresses food security concerns.  Their areas of expertise do not directly align with the specific subject matter of the "India Ageing Report 2023."


**4. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, criminalizes which specific practice, while also outlining provisions for the rehabilitation of individuals engaged in it?**

(a) Child trafficking
(b) Commercial surrogacy
(c) Manual scavenging
(d) Bonded labor

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, directly targets the practice of manual scavenging.  The act criminalizes the employment of individuals to manually remove human excreta from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits. It aims to eradicate this hazardous and dehumanizing practice.  The act also incorporates crucial provisions for the rehabilitation of those previously engaged in manual scavenging, offering alternative employment opportunities and financial assistance. The other options refer to distinct legal and social issues: child trafficking, commercial surrogacy, and bonded labor, each addressed under separate and specific legislation.  These practices, while involving exploitation, are not the central focus of the 2013 Act.


**5. Which government body in India is responsible for overseeing and supervising an independent ecosystem of accrediting institutions for higher educational institutions, envisioned as a "meta-accrediting body" under the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020?**

(a) University Grants Commission (UGC)
(b) National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET)
(c) National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
(d) National Accreditation Council (NAC)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Accreditation Council (NAC) is the body specifically designed under the NEP 2020 to function as a "meta-accrediting body" for higher education institutions in India.  Its role is to oversee and regulate the accreditation process, ensuring quality and standardization across different accrediting agencies.  The UGC, while involved in higher education regulation, does not have the specific mandate of overseeing other accrediting bodies in the same way NAC does.  NABET focuses on the accreditation of education and training, but primarily at a lower level than higher education.  NCERT is involved in curriculum development and research in school education and has recently been granted Deemed to be University status.  Therefore, none of the other options accurately reflect the central role of the NAC as the overarching body responsible for the accreditation ecosystem in higher education as envisioned by NEP 2020.


**6. According to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which type of offences committed by juveniles are categorized as those punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding seven years?**

(a) Petty offenses
(b) Serious offenses
(c) Heinous offenses
(d) Minor offenses

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, establishes a tiered system for classifying offenses committed by juveniles.  "Heinous offenses" are specifically defined as those carrying a minimum punishment of imprisonment for seven years or more under the Indian Penal Code or other relevant laws.  This classification is crucial as it determines the potential for trying a juvenile as an adult, a significant departure from traditional juvenile justice procedures.  Petty and serious offenses are defined by lower imprisonment terms, not meeting the criteria for a "heinous offense". The term "minor offenses" is not a legally defined category within the framework of this Act.


**7. Which of the following legal instruments defines the age of consent for sexual activity in India, playing a pivotal role in protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation?**

(a) The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956
(b) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012
(d) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, sets the legal age of consent in India.  By defining a child as anyone below 18 years old, the Act establishes a comprehensive framework for protecting children from all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation.  This Act is specifically designed to address sexual offenses against minors, making it the primary legal instrument for defining and enforcing the age of consent.  The other acts deal with distinct legal and social issues, namely adoption within the Hindu community (Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act), juvenile justice (Juvenile Justice Act), and surrogacy regulation (Surrogacy Act).  They don't directly address or define the age of consent for sexual activity.


**8. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation percentage for persons with benchmark disabilities in which specific sector?**

(a) Private sector employment
(b) Government jobs
(c) Private sector higher education
(d) Self-employment ventures

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum 4% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in government jobs. This affirmative action aims to promote inclusivity and equal opportunities in public employment.  The Act also includes provisions for reservations in higher education but doesn't specify a minimum percentage for the private sector.  The Act does not directly address reservations in the private sector or self-employment.  Therefore, only government jobs are explicitly covered under the Act's reservation policy for persons with benchmark disabilities.


**9. Which international organization, headquartered in Rome, Italy, is renowned for its efforts to combat hunger and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020?**

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(c)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(d)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The World Food Programme (WFP) is the United Nations agency dedicated to fighting hunger worldwide.  Its headquarters are located in Rome, Italy.  The WFP received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 for its contributions to combating hunger, making it the only organization among the options that fits this description. UNDESA focuses on broader economic and social development. IFPRI is a research institute working on food policy issues. UNFPA concentrates on population issues and reproductive health.  Therefore, only the WFP matches all the criteria mentioned in the question.


**10. Which Indian Act, enacted in 2021, aims to regulate and supervise Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) clinics and banks, while also preventing misuse and ensuring safe and ethical practices in ART services?**

(a) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
(b) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c) The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021
(d) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, is the primary legislation in India that specifically addresses the regulation of ART clinics and banks.  The Act aims to standardize procedures, prevent misuse, and ensure ethical practices in ART services, including surrogacy.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, focuses solely on the regulation of surrogacy, while the other options address distinct legal and social issues, namely juvenile justice and protection of children from sexual offenses.  Therefore, the ART Act is the only option that directly and comprehensively addresses the regulation of ART services as described.


**1.  A national-level initiative assesses the performance of school education systems.  It uses data from a specific year and a national survey to classify states and districts into ten grades. Which of the following is the highest grade awarded in this assessment in 2021-22?**

(a) Utkarsh
(b) Daksh
(c) Prachesta-2
(d) Atti-Uttam

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for States/UTs and PGI for Districts (PGI-D) assesses school education performance.  While the highest grade is *Daksh*,  no state or UT achieved this in the 2021-22 PGI 2.0 assessment.  The top grade achieved was *Prachesta-2*, attained by Punjab and Chandigarh. Options (a) and (d) represent lower grades within the PGI system. Option (b) is incorrect as no entity achieved the highest grade. The question tests factual recall regarding the PGI's grading system and its results for 2021-22.  Understanding the hierarchical structure of the grading system is crucial for correctly answering this question. The use of specific terminology like "Prachesta-2" and the context of state-level assessment further increases the difficulty level.


**2.  A policy aims to achieve a specific percentage of students enrolled in higher education by a target year.  This percentage is calculated as a ratio of enrolled students to the eligible population within a particular age range. What is the target percentage for this policy by the year 2035?**

(a) 30%
(b) 40%
(c) 50%
(d) 60%

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 sets a target Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for higher education. The GER measures the number of students enrolled in higher education as a percentage of the eligible population aged 18-23 years. The NEP aims to achieve at least a 50% GER by 2035. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not reflect the NEP's stated target. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the NEP's goals for higher education expansion.  The use of the specific term "Gross Enrolment Ratio" and the focus on a precise numerical target (50%) makes the question challenging, requiring more than superficial knowledge of educational policy.


**3.  An initiative aims to seamlessly integrate credits earned through different educational pathways. It includes school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education, all under a single framework. What is the name of this initiative?**

(a) National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF)
(b) National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)
(c) National Credit Framework (NCrF)
(d) National Curriculum Framework (NCF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Credit Framework (NCrF) is designed to integrate credits earned from school, higher education, and vocational/skill education.  It aims to create a unified system for credit accumulation and transfer, promoting flexibility and mobility between different educational pathways.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all individual qualification frameworks but not the overarching integrative framework.  This question tests conceptual understanding of the NCrF's purpose and its relationship to other educational frameworks.  The subtle differences between the options make it challenging; a superficial understanding of the Indian education system would not suffice.


**4.  A report highlights a global increase in a specific type of displacement between 2021 and 2022. This increase is attributed to various factors, including conflict, violence, and crises. Which organization released this report?**

(a) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(b) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNHCR released the "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report," which documented a significant increase in forced displacement worldwide.  The report highlighted the impact of conflict, violence, and various crises on global migration patterns.  IFPRI focuses on food security, UNFPA on population issues, and GANHRI on human rights institutions. This question tests factual recall regarding the source of specific reports and the organization's area of expertise.  The multiple plausible distractor options, all dealing with global issues, increase the difficulty.


**5.  A specific type of tribe in India was recognized in 1973 based on a commission's recommendations from 1961.  These tribes were later renamed in 2006. What was the original name given to this group of tribes in 1973?**

(a) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(b) De-Notified Tribes (DNTs)
(c) Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs)
(d) Nomadic Tribes (NTs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) were initially designated as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973, based on the recommendations of the U.N. Dhebar Commission (1961).  The name change to PVTGs occurred in 2006.  The other options represent different categories of tribal groups in India.  This question tests factual recall of historical details and the evolution of terminology related to Indian tribal communities. The specific dates and the change in nomenclature make this a challenging question requiring precise knowledge.


**6.  A government ministry released a report detailing the progress of a scheme to eliminate a specific practice.  The report indicates that a significant number of districts have declared themselves free from this practice. Which ministry is primarily responsible for this scheme?**

(a) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Labour and Employment
(d) Ministry of Rural Development

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Labour and Employment is responsible for the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, and related initiatives to eliminate manual scavenging.  The question refers to a report indicating progress in eliminating manual scavenging in many districts.  The other ministries address different social issues. This question tests factual recall of government ministries and their responsibilities concerning specific social problems. The precise focus on the ministry responsible for the scheme and the context of eliminating manual scavenging enhances the difficulty.


**7.  A specific act aims to prevent, prohibit, and redress sexual harassment against women in the workplace.  This legislation provides a legal framework for grievance redressal and defines various forms of sexual harassment. What is the name of this act?**

(a) Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(b) Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(c) Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013
(d) Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, specifically addresses sexual harassment in workplaces, establishing mechanisms for complaint filing, inquiry, and redressal.  The other options deal with different social issues. This question tests factual recall of legislation related to women's rights and workplace safety.  The specific and detailed nature of the act's title makes it a more demanding question.


**8.  A high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) deals specifically with indigenous issues. This body comprises independent experts and functions in their personal capacity.  What is the name of this body?**

(a) UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(b) UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(c) UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(d) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is a high-level advisory body to ECOSOC focused on indigenous issues. It comprises independent experts from various regions. The other options deal with children's rights, population, and national human rights institutions, respectively. This question tests factual recall of UN bodies and their mandates.  The precise identification of the body and its function makes the question difficult.


**9.  A report assesses the progress of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using a specific framework that aligns with global indicators and also includes India-specific indicators. Which organization developed this framework?**

(a) World Economic Forum
(b) World Bank
(c) United Nations Development Programme
(d) Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) developed the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs.  The NIF adapts global SDG indicators to suit India's context. The other organizations are involved in global development but didn't create the specific Indian framework. This question tests factual recall of the entities involved in monitoring and reporting on SDGs, particularly in the Indian context.  The specific focus on the Indian framework increases the difficulty.


**10.  A specific type of institution can now apply for a particular status even if it's less than 20 years old, a change from previous regulations.  These institutions are involved in higher education and may offer various degrees. Which type of institution is this?**

(a) Central Universities
(b) State Universities
(c) Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs)
(d) Private Universities

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, changed the eligibility criteria for Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs), allowing institutions less than 20 years old to apply for this status.  This contrasts with previous regulations.  The other options are not directly related to the change in regulations. This question tests knowledge of higher education regulations in India and the specific changes made.  The focus on a specific change in regulations and the terminology used makes the question more challenging.



**1.  The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India is found in which state?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Andaman and Nicobar Islands
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The statement correctly identifies Odisha as the state with the highest number of PVTGs. While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, the question specifically asks about PVTGs, a distinct category within Scheduled Tribes.  Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, exceeding the number in other states mentioned.  Andaman and Nicobar Islands, though hosting PVTGs, has a significantly smaller number compared to Odisha.  Chhattisgarh, while having some PVTGs, doesn't hold the highest number.  The distinction between Scheduled Tribes and PVTGs is crucial for understanding the unique challenges and vulnerabilities faced by these groups, highlighting the need for targeted interventions and policies. The concentration of PVTGs in Odisha underscores the importance of regional-specific development strategies and the need for tailored approaches to address their socio-economic disparities and protect their rights.


**2. Which commission's recommendations led to the initial recognition of Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973?**

(a) The Renke Commission
(b) The Idate Commission
(c) The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes
(d) The U.N. Dhebar Commission

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The U.N. Dhebar Commission, established in 1961, played a pivotal role in identifying and categorizing Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs). Its recommendations formed the basis for the government's recognition of PTGs in 1973.  The Renke Commission, while relevant to nomadic tribes, did not focus on PTGs.  The Idate Commission's report concerned De-notified Tribes. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes is a more recent body.  Understanding the historical context of PTG recognition is vital for appreciating the evolution of tribal welfare policies and the ongoing challenges of protecting the rights and interests of these highly vulnerable communities.  The Dhebar Commission's work highlights the importance of comprehensive assessments and targeted interventions for the most marginalized tribal groups.


**3.  Which ministry is the nodal ministry for tribal affairs in India?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(d) Ministry of Home Affairs

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Tribal Affairs holds the primary responsibility for formulating and implementing policies and programs related to the welfare and development of tribal communities in India.  While other ministries like the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Ministry of Rural Development, and Ministry of Home Affairs may have some overlapping concerns, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs has the dedicated mandate.  This centralized approach underscores the government's commitment to addressing the unique challenges faced by tribal populations, ensuring that their needs are specifically addressed through focused policies and programs.  Understanding the roles and responsibilities of different ministries is essential for analyzing the effectiveness of government interventions and identifying potential areas for improvement in tribal welfare.


**4. The Hakki Pikki Tribe, a semi-nomadic group, primarily hails from which state?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Odisha
(c) Chhattisgarh
(d) Karnataka

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Hakki Pikki Tribe is prominently associated with the state of Karnataka. The question tests knowledge of specific tribal groups and their geographical locations.  Other options listed are states with significant tribal populations, but they are not the primary origin of the Hakki Pikki Tribe.  Understanding the geographical distribution of various tribal groups is important for designing effective and targeted development programs and for protecting their cultural identity and traditional practices.  The Hakki Pikki case highlights the importance of acknowledging the diversity within India's tribal communities and adopting tailored approaches to their unique needs.


**5.  Which Act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871?**

(a) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(b) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(c) The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d) The Forest Rights Act, 2006

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Habitual Offenders Act of 1952 repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871. This act had historically labeled certain nomadic communities as "criminal tribes," leading to systemic discrimination and marginalization. The repeal signifies a step towards rectifying historical injustices and acknowledging the human rights of these communities.  The other acts listed address specific issues related to women, Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and forest rights, but they are not directly related to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.  Understanding the historical context of discriminatory legislation and the subsequent efforts to address these injustices is crucial for comprehending the complexities of social justice in India.  The repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act is a significant landmark in the struggle for social equality and the recognition of human rights for marginalized communities.



**6. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is primarily tasked with which of the following?**

(a) Implementing the Forest Rights Act, 2006
(b) Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to De-notified Tribes
(c) Monitoring the implementation of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(d) Overseeing the implementation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCDNT's core mandate includes preparing a comprehensive state-wise list of castes belonging to De-notified Tribes (DNTs). This task is crucial for targeted interventions and policy formulation. While other commissions and acts address related issues of tribal welfare, forest rights, and the protection of women, the NCDNT's specific focus is on DNTs. The creation of the NCDNT demonstrates the government's recognition of the unique challenges faced by DNTs and the need for specific policies and programs to address their socio-economic disparities.  The accurate identification of DNT communities is critical for effective policy implementation and for ensuring that these vulnerable groups receive the support and services they need.


**7.  Which day is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day in India?**

(a) August 9th
(b) August 31st
(c) December 28th
(d) January 26th

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day (also known as De-notified Tribes Day) in India. This day is dedicated to raising awareness about the issues faced by De-notified Tribes (DNTs) and advocating for their rights and welfare.  Other dates mentioned are significant in different contexts: August 9th is International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples; December 28th marks the founding of the Indian National Congress; and January 26th is Republic Day.  The observance of Vimukta Jatis Day highlights the ongoing need to address the historical injustices and ongoing challenges faced by DNTs in India and to promote their social inclusion and empowerment.  The date serves as a reminder of the importance of acknowledging the contributions of DNTs to Indian society and of working towards a more equitable and just society.


**8. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation of what percentage in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities?**

(a) 2%
(b) 3%
(c) 4%
(d) 5%

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation of 4% in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities.  This is a significant legal provision aimed at promoting inclusivity and ensuring equal opportunities for PwDs in the workforce.  The other options represent incorrect percentages.  The 4% reservation underscores the government's commitment to ensuring that PwDs have equal access to employment opportunities and are not excluded from participating fully in society.  Understanding the provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016, is essential for analyzing the effectiveness of government policies aimed at promoting inclusivity and addressing the challenges faced by PwDs in India.


**9.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prescribes what maximum punishment for employing individuals as manual scavengers?**

(a) Imprisonment up to 1 year or a fine up to Rs. 50,000, or both
(b) Imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both
(c) Imprisonment up to 5 years or a fine up to Rs. Two Lakhs, or both
(d) Imprisonment up to 10 years or a fine up to Rs. Five Lakhs, or both

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act, 2013, prescribes a maximum punishment of imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both, for employing individuals as manual scavengers.  This stringent provision aims to deter the practice of manual scavenging and protect the dignity and safety of those engaged in this hazardous work.  The other options present incorrect penalties.  The severity of the punishment reflects the government's commitment to eradicating manual scavenging and rehabilitating those affected by this practice.

The other options list different organizations that work on related issues but do not publish the GHI.  The GHI report provides valuable data on global hunger levels and informs policy decisions aimed at reducing hunger and malnutrition worldwide.  The report's findings help to identify areas that require urgent attention and to track progress towards achieving global goals related to food security.


**20. Which of the following is NOT a key dimension of Universal Health Coverage (UHC)?**

(a) Accessibility
(b) Affordability
(c) Equity
(d) Quality

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** While equity is a highly desirable goal within UHC, it is not considered one of the core dimensions. The three primary dimensions are accessibility (ensuring everyone can access health services), affordability (services are financially feasible), and quality (services are effective and safe).  Equity is a broader societal goal that influences the achievement of the three core dimensions.  Understanding the key dimensions of UHC is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of health policies and for prioritizing investments in the health sector.  The focus on accessibility, affordability, and quality is essential for ensuring that everyone has access to the health services they need without facing financial hardship.




**1.  Which organization released a report highlighting the rise in food insecurity between 2020 and 2022, attributing it to factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical instability?**

(a)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(b)  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(c)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  World Food Programme (WFP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) released the Global Food Policy Report 2023, which specifically addressed the surge in food insecurity during the period 2020-2022.  The report directly linked this rise to a confluence of crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted supply chains and exacerbated existing vulnerabilities; climate change and natural disasters, which negatively impacted agricultural production; and civil unrest and political instability in various regions, further disrupting food systems.  The other organizations, while involved in related areas of development and humanitarian aid, did not produce a report with this specific focus on the timeframe and causal factors mentioned in the question.  The UNFPA focuses on population issues, UNDESA on broader sustainable development goals, and the WFP on food assistance, but none directly addressed the specific findings of the IFPRI report on food insecurity during that particular period.

Its role includes reviewing reports submitted by states on their progress, considering individual complaints, and providing guidance on the interpretation and application of the convention.  The issuance of guidance on children’s right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment represents a key function within this mandate. The other organizations, while addressing important related issues, do not have the direct responsibility for monitoring the UNCRC's implementation or issuing such specific guidance.  The UNCPD focuses on population and development, the WFP on food security, and UNDESA on broader economic and social affairs.

(c)  Path to Equal Report
(d)  Global Gender Gap Index

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Global Gender Gap Index, published annually by the World Economic Forum, is specifically designed to measure gender inequality across four key dimensions.  These dimensions – Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment – provide a comprehensive assessment of gender disparities worldwide. The other reports focus on different aspects of gender equality or other development indicators. The Gender Social Norms Index examines social norms impacting gender equality, the UHC Service Coverage Index tracks health coverage, and the Path to Equal Report uses different indices (Women's Empowerment Index and Global Gender Parity Index).  Therefore, only the Global Gender Gap Index directly matches the description provided.


**6. Which Indian government ministry is the nodal ministry for the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)?**

(a) Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Panchayati Raj
(d) Ministry of Finance

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Rural Development is the nodal ministry responsible for the implementation and oversight of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY).

(b)  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
(c)  The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, is the legislation that repealed the discriminatory Criminal Tribes Act of 1871.  The Criminal Tribes Act unjustly stigmatized and criminalized entire communities, leading to widespread social and economic marginalization.  The 1952 Act aimed to address this historical injustice by removing the legal basis for such labeling.  The other Acts address different issues related to marginalized communities but did not directly repeal the Criminal Tribes Act.  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act deals with atrocities against scheduled castes and tribes, the Protection of Human Rights Act addresses human rights violations in general, and the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act focuses on the elimination of manual scavenging.

(b) Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021
(c) Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971
(d) Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, is specifically designed to regulate the ART sector in India.  Its primary goals include establishing standards for ART clinics and banks, preventing unethical practices, ensuring the safety of patients, and protecting the rights of individuals undergoing ART procedures.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, focuses specifically on surrogacy, while the MTP Act relates to abortion, and the PCPNDT Act addresses prenatal sex determination.  Therefore, only the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act directly addresses the regulation and supervision of ART services as described in the question.


**10. Which of the following is the statutory body acting as the nodal body governing all aspects of inter-country and intra-country adoptions in India?**

(a)  State Adoption Resource Agency (SARA)
(b)  District Child Welfare Committee
(c)  Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA)
(d)  Specialized Adoption Agency (SAA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) is the designated statutory body in India that oversees all aspects of both inter-country and intra-country adoptions.  It functions as the nodal agency, coordinating and regulating the adoption process, ensuring adherence to legal frameworks and ethical standards, and facilitating the matching of children with prospective adoptive parents.  The other bodies play important roles in the adoption process but do not have the overall authority and responsibility that CARA holds.  SARA operates at the state level, the District Child Welfare Committee at the district level, and SAAs are recognized agencies for placing children in adoption.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on social issues in India.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring in-depth knowledge and analysis.  The difficulty stems from the need for precise factual recall and the inclusion of plausible but incorrect distractors.

**1.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, significantly altered the landscape of surrogacy in India. Which of the following accurately reflects a key change introduced by these rules?**

(a)  Commercial surrogacy was legalized under strict government oversight.
(b)  Traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is genetically related to the child, was explicitly permitted.
(c)  The use of donor gametes was permitted under specific medical conditions, reversing a previous prohibition.
(d)  Single men were allowed to utilize surrogacy services for the first time.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 amendments to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act of 2021 allowed the use of donor gametes in cases where the intending couple has a medical condition necessitating it, provided at least one gamete originates from the intending couple.  This directly contradicts the previous Rule 7, which prohibited donor gametes. Option (a) is incorrect as commercial surrogacy remains banned. Option (b) is incorrect because traditional surrogacy is not explicitly permitted; the focus remains on gestational surrogacy. Option (d) is incorrect; the rules do not address surrogacy for single men.  The amendment reflects a nuanced approach, balancing ethical concerns with the medical needs of infertile couples. This highlights the evolving legal and ethical debates surrounding assisted reproductive technologies in India.


**2. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) introduced several key changes to India's school education system. Which of the following is NOT a direct outcome or feature of the NCF-SE?**

(a)  The adoption of a 5+3+3+4 age-based curricular structure.
(b)  The introduction of a binary accreditation system for schools, replacing a graded system.
(c)  The emphasis on multilingualism, encouraging proficiency in at least three languages.
(d)  The integration of Indian contributions to various disciplines across different historical periods into the curriculum.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE focuses on restructuring the school curriculum and pedagogy, including the 5+3+3+4 structure, multilingualism, and the integration of India's historical contributions to knowledge. However, the introduction of a binary accreditation system for schools is not a direct feature of the NCF-SE itself.  The NCF-SE is a curriculum framework; accreditation is a separate process governed by different bodies and frameworks. Option (a), (c), and (d) are all directly mentioned as key highlights of the NCF-SE. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the distinction between curriculum design and the broader educational assessment and accreditation systems.


**3.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), significantly altered the legal framework for protecting the rights of people with disabilities in India. Which of the following is NOT a provision or outcome directly related to the RPwD Act?**

(a)  The mandatory relocation of government offices operating from inaccessible buildings to ground floor or accessible locations.
(b)  The establishment of a National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT).
(c)  The recognition of 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
(d)  The mandate for airlines operating in India to implement the RPwD Act's accessibility provisions.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act focuses on the rights and accessibility for persons with disabilities.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are all direct provisions or outcomes of the Act. The establishment of the NCDNT, however, falls under a different legislative framework concerning tribal welfare.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between legislation addressing different vulnerable groups in India.  While both Acts aim to protect vulnerable populations, their specific mandates and jurisdictions are distinct.


**4.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) report generates considerable debate. Which of the following statements accurately reflects a criticism leveled against the GHI methodology?**

(a)  The GHI consistently overestimates the prevalence of hunger in developing countries.
(b)  The GHI relies solely on data from international organizations, neglecting national-level data.
(c)  The GHI's methodology has been criticized for issues related to sample size and data sources.
(d)  The GHI fails to account for the nutritional value of locally produced foods.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian government, among others, has voiced concerns about the GHI's methodology, specifically citing issues related to the sample size used in data collection and the sources of data employed in calculating the index. While the GHI does incorporate data from multiple sources, including national-level surveys, the criticism centers on the potential biases and limitations inherent in the chosen data and sample size, which may not accurately reflect the complex realities of hunger and malnutrition in diverse contexts. Options (a), (b), and (d) represent potential criticisms of other indices or methodologies, but not the specific concerns raised about the GHI methodology.


**5. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) aims to revolutionize India's education system. Which of the following is NOT a core feature or objective of the NCrF?**

(a)  The creation of a unified credit system integrating school, higher education, and vocational training.
(b)  The introduction of a standardized notional learning hours system across all educational levels.
(c)  The establishment of a new national accreditation body for all educational institutions.
(d)  The provision of multiple entry and exit points within the educational ecosystem.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF focuses on creating a unified credit system, standardizing learning hours, and enabling multiple entry/exit points.  The establishment of a new national accreditation body, while a desirable goal within the broader context of educational reform, is not a direct function of the NCrF.  The NCrF focuses on credit accumulation and transfer; accreditation is a separate process.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the specific goals and scope of the NCrF within the larger framework of educational reforms in India.


**6.  Several international organizations play a vital role in addressing global social issues. Which of the following is NOT accurately paired with its primary mandate or area of focus?**

(a)  UNFPA: Sexual and reproductive health rights.
(b)  UNDESA: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
(c)  UNHCR: Climate change mitigation and adaptation.
(d)  WFP: Food security and humanitarian aid.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

UNFPA, UNDESA, and WFP are accurately paired with their core mandates.  UNHCR's primary mandate is to protect refugees and displaced persons, not climate change mitigation, although climate change is increasingly a factor in displacement.  The question tests knowledge of international organizations and their areas of expertise, highlighting the multi-faceted nature of global challenges and the specialized roles of different UN agencies.


**7.  The 2023 report on the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 highlighted several key aspects of higher education in India. Which of the following is NOT a finding or recommendation directly related to that report?**

(a)  The significant increase in Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education.
(b)  The establishment of the National Research Foundation (NRF).
(c)  The introduction of a new National Credit Framework (NCrF) for higher education.
(d)  The recommendation for a transition to a binary accreditation system for higher education institutions.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While the NEP 2020 aims to increase the GER, the report on its implementation would likely focus on the progress made and challenges encountered, rather than stating a specific increase in GER as a direct outcome of the report itself.  The establishment of the NRF, the NCrF, and the transition to a binary accreditation system are all key elements of the NEP 2020 and would be discussed within a report on its implementation.  The question tests the ability to distinguish between the goals of a policy and the findings of a report on its implementation.


**8.  Various government initiatives aim to address the issue of manual scavenging in India. Which of the following is NOT a direct initiative or outcome related to the elimination of manual scavenging?**

(a) The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR).
(b) The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS).
(c) The National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme.
(d) The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system.


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

PEMSR, SRMS, and NAMASTE are all direct initiatives to address manual scavenging.  While a National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system is related to the broader goal of eliminating manual scavenging, it's not a named, standalone initiative in the same way as the other options.  The question highlights the nuances in the wording and the need for precise understanding of specific government programs.


**1.  Which initiative aims to holistically address health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels in India?**

(a) National Health Policy 2017
(b) Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(c) Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(d) Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ayushman Bharat Yojana (ABY) is a comprehensive health insurance scheme designed to provide financial protection and access to quality healthcare services across all levels of care.  Its holistic approach covers primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare, addressing various aspects of health needs.  While the National Health Policy 2017 aims to achieve universal health coverage (UHC), it's a broader policy framework, not a specific program like ABY. Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on immunization, and the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission concentrates on digital health infrastructure.  Therefore, ABY is the most accurate answer as it directly addresses the multi-level healthcare provision mentioned in the question.


**2.  The Poshan Abhiyan's social model for inclusive care for children with disabilities incorporates which of the following key elements?**

(a)  Exclusive institutionalization and specialized therapy.
(b)  Early screening for disability signs, community inclusion, and referral support.
(c)  Solely focusing on family empowerment and financial aid.
(d)  Emphasis on individual therapy and minimal community engagement.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children, a key element of the Poshan Abhiyan, explicitly adopts a social model of disability inclusion.  This model emphasizes early identification of disability through screening, active participation in community events to foster inclusion and empower families, and seamless referral pathways through ASHA/ANM and RBSK teams for further support. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either contradict or omit crucial aspects of the inclusive approach outlined in the protocol. The social model prioritizes integration within the community, rather than segregation, and recognizes the importance of both family support and professional referrals.


**3. Which of the following is NOT a key objective of the Anganwadi Services Scheme (now Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0)?**

(a)  Improving the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years.
(b)  Reducing mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition rates among target groups.
(c)  Providing vocational training to Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) for higher paying jobs.
(d)  Improving the nutritional and health status of pregnant and lactating mothers.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the Saksham Anganwadi initiative aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Anganwadis and expand their reach to include adolescent girls and early childhood care and education, providing vocational training for AWWs to secure higher-paying jobs is not a primary objective. The scheme's focus remains on improving the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and reducing associated mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition rates.  Providing vocational training could be a supplementary initiative but not a core objective of the Anganwadi Services Scheme.


**4.  Which three insurance schemes cover Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs)?**

(a) Ayushman Bharat, PMJJBY, and PMSBY
(b) PMJJBY, PMSBY, and Anganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana (AKBY)
(c)  ESIC, EPFO, and PMSBY
(d)  NPS, PMJJBY, and AKBY

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that AWWs and AWHs are covered under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), and Anganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana (AKBY).  These three schemes specifically provide insurance coverage for these frontline workers. The other options either include schemes not mentioned in the context or exclude the AKBY, which is specifically designed for Anganwadi workers.


**5.  The "Triple Threat Report" by UNICEF identifies which three interconnected threats related to WASH services affecting children?**

(a) Inadequate water access, high infant mortality, and lack of sanitation facilities.
(b)  Limited water and sanitation access, high WASH-related child mortality, and high climate risk.
(c)  Poor hygiene practices, lack of nutrition, and inadequate healthcare.
(d)  Water scarcity, sanitation issues, and lack of awareness campaigns.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

UNICEF's "Triple Threat Report" focuses on the combined impact of three major factors: less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation services, a high burden of WASH-attributable deaths among children under five (placing the country among the top 20), and a high risk of climate and environmental hazards (placing it within the top 25% of countries in the Children's Climate Risk Index).  These three factors create a "triple burden" for children,  making option (b) the correct answer. The other options either partially address the report's focus or omit key aspects of the "triple threat."


**6. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report on WASH, what percentage of all deaths globally could have been prevented by access to safe WASH services in 2019?**

(a) 5.2%
(b) 2.5%
(c) 10%
(d) 1.5%

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The WHO report clearly states that in 2019, utilizing safe WASH services could have prevented 2.5% of all deaths globally.  The other options present incorrect percentages, highlighting the importance of accurate data recall in answering this question.  Understanding the significance of WASH in global health and the specific findings of this WHO report is crucial for correct response.


**7.  Which two organizations jointly released the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023?**

(a)  World Bank and IMF
(b)  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
(c)  UNICEF and WHO
(d)  FAO and WFP

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the GHI 2023 was released by Concern Worldwide (an Irish NGO) and Welt Hunger Hilfe (a German NGO). The other options list organizations involved in other aspects of food security and development, but not the specific publishers of the GHI report.  Accurate identification of the publishing organizations is essential for answering this question.


**8.  What is the GHI score of India in 2023, and what category does it fall under on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale?**

(a) 27.0, Serious
(b) 28.7, Serious
(c) 29.2, Alarming
(d) 30.1, Severe

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that India's GHI score in 2023 is 28.7, categorizing it as "Serious" on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale.  The other options misrepresent either the score or the severity category, indicating the necessity of precise factual recall.


**9.  Which ministry is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare in India?**

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Home Affairs
(d) Ministry of Tribal Affairs

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly names the Ministry of Tribal Affairs as the nodal ministry responsible for tribal welfare in India.  The other options represent ministries with related but distinct mandates, highlighting the importance of carefully identifying the correct responsible body.


**10. Which state houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Jharkhand
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly indicates that Odisha has the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh also have significant PVTG populations, Odisha holds the largest number, making (d) the correct answer.  This question tests precise factual recall.


**11. Which three tribes, listed as PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, were recently granted Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006?**

(a)  Baiga, Gond, and Oraon
(b)  Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga
(c)  Saharia, Bhil, and Korku
(d)  Birhor, Korwa, and Pauri

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text specifically mentions the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes as PVTGs in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and their recent grant of Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.  The other options list tribes that are PVTGs in some states but not necessarily in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, or they don't match the tribes specifically mentioned in the passage.


**12.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is tasked with what primary function?**

(a)  Providing financial aid and vocational training to DNTs.
(b)  Implementing the SEED scheme for DNT communities.
(c)  Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
(d)  Overseeing the construction of hostels for DNT children.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the NCDNT's primary function is to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to the Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs). While other options mention initiatives related to DNT welfare, they are not the commission's core responsibility. The question focuses on the commission's specific mandate.


**13. Which Act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871?**

(a) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(b) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(c) The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d) The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly indicates that the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952.  The other options are relevant pieces of legislation focusing on different social groups and issues but not the specific act that repealed the Criminal Tribes Act.


**14.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation of what percentage in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities?**

(a) 2%
(b) 5%
(c) 3%
(d) 4%

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation of 4% in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities.  The other options provide incorrect percentages, demonstrating the need for accurate information retrieval.  Note that this reservation does not apply to police forces.


**15. Which government body is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016?**

(a) National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
(b) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(c) Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
(d)  National Commission for Women (NCW)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment is the ministry responsible for the implementation of the RPwD Act, 2016.  While other bodies deal with related social issues, the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment has the primary responsibility for this specific legislation.


**16. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prescribes what maximum punishment for employing someone as a manual scavenger?**

(a)  A fine of ₹50,000
(b) Imprisonment up to 5 years or a fine up to ₹2 lakh, or both.
(c) Imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to ₹One Lakh, or both.
(d)  Community service for 6 months.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage details the penalties under the PEMSR Act, 2013, specifying that violating the law by employing someone as a manual scavenger results in imprisonment of up to two years, a fine up to ₹One Lakh, or both. The other options propose incorrect penalties, emphasizing the importance of precise factual recall of the legal framework.


**17. Which joint initiative promotes 100% mechanization of sanitation tasks, including sewer and septic tank cleaning?**

(a)  Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs)
(b)  Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs)

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assesses various cognitive skills, primarily factual recall with elements of analysis and conceptual understanding.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the candidate's background.


**1.  A global partnership established in 1971, dedicated to research for a food-secured future, is the primary affiliation of a major research center established in 1975. This research center works in over 60 countries and focuses on poverty, hunger, and malnutrition reduction. Which organization is this research center?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(d)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).  It correctly identifies IFPRI's establishment year (1975), its focus on poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, and its affiliation with the CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research), a global partnership established in 1971. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all significant organizations involved in food security and related issues, but they do not match the description provided. WFP focuses on food assistance, FAO on broader agricultural development, and UNFPA on population issues.  The specific details of IFPRI's affiliation with CGIAR and its geographic reach are crucial to selecting the correct answer, making this a difficult question.


**2.  A 2023 report, released in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), highlights India's demographic shift, including its population surpassing another nation's by mid-2023, its relatively young population, and its growing elderly population. Which organization is responsible for this report?**

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  World Health Organization (WHO)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description points to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and its India Ageing Report 2023.  The report's focus on India's demographic trends, including population size, age structure, and the growing elderly population, directly aligns with UNFPA's mandate. The other options are incorrect because they don't primarily focus on demographic trends and population aging. UNDESA covers broader economic and social issues, UNCRC focuses on children's rights, and WHO on public health. The mention of collaboration with IIPS adds a layer of specificity, requiring precise knowledge of UNFPA's activities.


**3.  A 1993-established organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, accredits National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Paris Principles, adopted in 1993 by the UN General Assembly.  This organization recently deferred the accreditation of India’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). What is the name of this organization?**

(a) UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC)
(b)  Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
(c) Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d)  Amnesty International

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The detailed description precisely matches the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI).  The question highlights GANHRI's role in accrediting NHRIs, its adherence to the Paris Principles, its location, and its recent action regarding the NHRC.  The inclusion of the Paris Principles and the specific action against NHRC enhances the question's difficulty.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all involved in human rights but do not fulfill the criteria detailed in the question's description.  The precise details of GANHRI's function and its relationship with the Paris Principles make this a difficult question.



**4.  This organization, established by a UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) resolution in 2000, is a high-level advisory body focused on indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, the environment, education, health, and human rights.  It consists of 16 independent experts, with half nominated by governments and half by indigenous organizations. Which organization is this?**

(a)  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(b)  Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(c)  Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples
(d)  International Labour Organization (ILO)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The question accurately describes the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII).  The details regarding its establishment (2000), its advisory role to ECOSOC, its composition (16 experts, half from governments, half from indigenous organizations), and its mandate on indigenous issues are all key aspects of UNPFII’s structure and function. The other options are all involved in indigenous rights but do not fit the description given.  The specific details regarding the composition of the forum and its advisory role make this a challenging question.


**5.  A 2016 Act, amended in 2021, aims to prevent the practice of removing human excreta by hand from sewers or septic tanks.  This practice is banned, and violations result in imprisonment and fines. Which Act addresses this practice?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b)  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
(c)  The Right to Education Act, 2009
(d)  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. The description focuses on the act’s central aim of prohibiting manual scavenging and the penalties associated with its violation. Options (a), (c), and (d) address different social issues, making them incorrect. The amendment date (2021) is a distractor, intended to make the question more challenging by requiring recall of specific details related to the act’s timeline. The specific details of penalties and the focus on manual scavenging make this a difficult question.


**6.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation percentage in government jobs and higher education institutions for individuals with disabilities.  What is this minimum reservation percentage for government jobs under this Act?**

(a) 2%
(b) 3%
(c) 4%
(d) 5%

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on a specific provision of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 – the minimum reservation for government jobs.  The correct answer is 4%.  While the act also mandates reservations in higher education (5%), the question specifically targets the employment reservation, requiring precise knowledge of the act's provisions.  The close proximity of the options (2%, 3%, 4%, 5%) makes this a difficult question, requiring precise factual knowledge.


**7.  A recent report highlights the rising global trend of forced displacement due to persecution, conflict, violence, and human rights violations, which was 21% higher in 2022 than in 2021. It also states that 76% of the world's refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries.  Which organization is most likely to have published this report?**

(a)  International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  World Bank
(d)  International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question describes a report on forced displacement and refugee trends, which strongly indicates the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as the likely publisher. UNHCR's mandate directly relates to the subject matter of the report.  The statistics provided (21% increase in 2022, 76% of refugees hosted by low- and middle-income countries) are consistent with UNHCR's data collection and reporting. The other options are involved in migration or humanitarian aid but do not have the direct mandate and data focus on refugee issues that UNHCR does. The specific percentages and the focus on refugee hosting patterns make this a difficult question.


**8. The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), released by the Ministry of Education, proposes a new curricular and pedagogical structure for schooling.  This structure is based on a 5+3+3+4 age-based design. Which organization was primarily responsible for developing the NCF-SE?**

(a)  Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)
(b)  Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR)
(c)  National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
(d)  University Grants Commission (UGC)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) is the primary organization responsible for developing the NCF-SE.  The question highlights the NCF-SE's focus on curriculum and pedagogy reform and its age-based structure.  The other options are involved in education but do not have the central role in curriculum development that NCERT does.  The mention of the specific 5+3+3+4 structure and the focus on the organization's role in curriculum reform make this a challenging question.



**9.  The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), includes indicators aligned with global indicators and those tailored to India's specific needs.  In which year was the NIF initially developed?**

(a) 2015
(b) 2018
(c) 2020
(d) 2023

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The correct answer is 2018. The question tests the precise year of the NIF's initial development, requiring factual recall of a specific date related to a significant policy initiative.  The other options are plausible distractors, representing other important years in the SDG and NIF timeline, increasing the difficulty level of the question.  The precise year and the focus on the NIF’s development make this a difficult question.


**10. A report ranks universities globally based on four factors: quality of education, employability, quality of faculty, and research performance.  In 2023, this report featured 64 Indian universities. Which organization is most likely to have published this report?**

(a) Times Higher Education
(b) QS Quacquarelli Symonds
(c) Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR)
(d)  ShanghaiRanking Consultancy

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR) is known for its global university rankings based on the four factors described in the question. The question's inclusion of the number of Indian universities (64) in the 2023 report adds specificity, increasing the difficulty. The other options also produce global university rankings but don't perfectly match the description given. The specific details of the ranking methodology and the mention of the number of Indian universities make this a difficult question.


**1.  A significant judgment concerning surrogacy, involving a woman with a rare congenital disorder affecting her reproductive system, was delivered by which judicial body?**

(a) The High Court of Delhi
(b) The Supreme Court of India
(c) The National Human Rights Commission
(d) The National Green Tribunal

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court of India, in the case of *Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India*, allowed a woman with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) Syndrome to undergo surrogacy using a donor egg.  This decision highlighted the complexities of surrogacy laws in India and the need for compassionate consideration of individual circumstances.  The High Court of Delhi and the National Green Tribunal do not typically handle cases related to surrogacy. While the National Human Rights Commission deals with human rights violations, this specific case fell under the purview of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction on legal matters.


**2.  Which Act, amended in 2021, significantly altered the accessibility of medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) in India, particularly extending the gestational limit for certain categories of women?**

(a) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005

(c) The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971
(d) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, underwent significant amendments in 2021.  These amendments broadened the categories of women eligible for abortion beyond 20 weeks of gestation, encompassing survivors of rape or incest, those facing changes in marital status during pregnancy, and cases involving risks to the mother's health or fetal abnormalities.  The other acts listed deal with distinct legal areas: domestic violence, juvenile justice, and surrogacy regulation, respectively.


**3.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, broadened the definition of "domestic violence" to encompass which of the following?**

(a) Only physical and sexual abuse.
(b) Physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse.

(d)  Neglect and abandonment exclusively.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PWDVA, 2005, provides a comprehensive definition of domestic violence, encompassing not only physical and sexual abuse but also verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.  This holistic approach recognizes the multifaceted nature of domestic violence and its impact on victims. The other options present incomplete or inaccurate portrayals of the act's scope.

(a) Section 304B of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023
(b) Section 80 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023
(c) The Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961
(d)  The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961 provided the initial legal definition of dowry in India, outlining the prohibition of giving or accepting property or valuable securities in connection with marriage. While subsequent legislation, such as sections within the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, address dowry-related crimes like dowry death, the 1961 Act established the foundational legal framework for combating this practice.  The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act deals with adoption and maintenance within the Hindu community.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Boeing Sukanya Program specifically targets girls and women, aiming to promote their involvement in STEM fields and creating opportunities within the aviation sector.  The program establishes STEM labs and offers scholarships to women pursuing pilot training, directly addressing the underrepresentation of women in these areas. The other options are not the primary focus of this initiative.


**6.  Which Act, enacted to address workplace safety for women, legally enshrined the Supreme Court's Vishaka Guidelines concerning sexual harassment?**

(c) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(d) The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, formally incorporated the Vishaka Guidelines, which were initially established by the Supreme Court.  These guidelines defined sexual harassment and mandated the establishment of internal complaints committees in workplaces to address such issues.  The other acts deal with different legal domains.

**Explanation:** The UNICEF report, titled "Triple Threat," specifically examines the interconnected risks of inadequate WASH services for children, considering factors like access to basic services, mortality rates attributable to unsafe WASH, and climate change risks.  While WHO and the World Bank are involved in WASH-related initiatives, the "Triple Threat" report is a UNICEF publication.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The MoSPI is responsible for developing and maintaining the NIF for SDGs in India.  The NIF incorporates indicators that are consistent with the global SDG indicator framework while also including indicators tailored to the specific context and priorities of India.  The other ministries have relevant roles in implementing SDGs but not in developing the overarching NIF.

**1.  Consider the following regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education in India:**

The PGI system, utilizing data from UDISE+ and NAS, assesses school education performance at which levels?

(a) National and State levels only
(b) State and District levels only
(c) National, State, and District levels
(d) State levels only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the passage explicitly states that the PGI assesses performance at the State and District levels. Option (a) is incorrect as the passage does not mention a national-level assessment by PGI. Option (c) is incorrect because, while national data might be compiled from state and district data,  the PGI itself does not directly assess performance at the national level. Option (d) is too narrow; the PGI includes district-level assessments as well. The PGI uses a tiered grading system, highlighting the relative performance of different states and districts, a crucial aspect of educational policy analysis.  Understanding the tiered grading system and the data sources used (UDISE+ and NAS) demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the PGI's functionality and importance in evaluating India's school education system.

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b).

Option (a) is too limited in scope; the NCrF's ambition is much broader. Option (c) is incorrect; the NCrF focuses on credit integration, not just examination standardization. Option (d) is also incorrect; while the UGC is a key player in developing the NCrF,  it's a joint initiative involving multiple bodies, including AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, and various ministries.

**Explanation:** The question directly points to the UNHCR's "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report."  The UNHCR is the UN agency specifically mandated to deal with refugees and forcibly displaced people. The other organizations, while involved in human rights and migration issues, did not release the report described. The IOM deals with migration, but its focus is broader than just forced displacement. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are prominent NGOs that document human rights abuses, but they are not the source of this specific report.


**3.  An international body, established in 1993, is responsible for accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Paris Principles.  In 2023, this body deferred the accreditation of a specific Asian nation's NHRC, citing concerns about political interference and lack of cooperation with civil society.  What is the name of this international body?**

(a) The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
(b) The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)
(c) The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d) The UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes GANHRI's role in accrediting NHRIs based on the Paris Principles and its 2023 decision regarding India's NHRC. GANHRI is the specific organization responsible for this accreditation process.  While the OHCHR is the leading UN human rights body and the UNHRC is a key UN forum, neither directly undertakes the accreditation described. The FIDH is a prominent NGO advocating for human rights, but it does not have the specific accreditation function described.


**4. A high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), established in 2000, focuses on issues related to indigenous peoples' economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights.  This body is composed of independent experts nominated both by governments and indigenous organizations. Which organization is described?**

(a) The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(b) The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(c) The Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples
(d) The UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC)


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The description precisely matches the mandate and structure of the UNPFII.  The other options are also involved in indigenous rights, but they lack the specific characteristics (high-level advisory body to ECOSOC, dual nomination process) mentioned in the question.  The UNHRC deals with a broader range of human rights issues.


**5. A report released in 2023 assessed the performance of India's school education system at the state and district levels, categorizing them into ten grades based on data from UDISE+ and NAS.  This report revealed that no state or union territory achieved the highest grade.  Which assessment index is described?**

(a) The National Achievement Survey (NAS)
(b) The Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+)
(c) The Performance Grading Index (PGI)
(d) The National Education Policy (NEP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question clearly describes the Performance Grading Index (PGI) and its key finding for 2021-22.  UDISE+ and NAS are data sources used by the PGI, but they are not the assessment index itself. The NEP is a policy document that sets the framework for education reform but does not directly conduct this type of assessment.


**6.  Legislation enacted in 2013 aims to prevent, prohibit, and redress sexual harassment in the workplace. This legislation builds upon guidelines established by the Supreme Court in 1997.  Which legislation is described?**

(a) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(b) The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013
(c) The Indian Penal Code (IPC)
(d) The Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description accurately reflects the POSH Act of 2013 and its relationship to the Vishaka Guidelines. The other options address related issues of violence against women but don't focus specifically on workplace harassment.


**7.  A government initiative launched in 2017 focuses on reducing malnutrition among children, pregnant women, and mothers by improving the utilization of key Anganwadi services.  This initiative employs a digital tracking system to monitor progress.  Which initiative is described?**

(a) Ayushman Bharat Yojana
(b) Intensified Mission Indradhanush
(c) National Health Policy 2017
(d) National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The description accurately portrays the POSHAN Abhiyan's goals and methods, including its use of digital tracking.  The other options address health and welfare issues but don't match the specific focus on nutrition and Anganwadi services.

(b) The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023
(c) The SERB Act, 2008
(d) The UGC Act, 1956


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question accurately describes the NRF Act's purpose and its relationship to the SERB. The other options deal with broader education or research-related legislation but don't match the specific details provided.


**9.  A report released annually by the World Economic Forum assesses gender equality across countries using four parameters.  In 2023, India's ranking in this report was below the median.  Which index is described?**

(a) The Gender Social Norms Index
(b) The Global Gender Gap Index
(c) The UHC Service Coverage Index
(d) The Women’s Empowerment Index


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question directly refers to the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) and its methodology. The other indices address related aspects of gender equality or health, but they do not match the specifics given in the question.


**10.  A 2016 Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities and provides for reservations in government jobs and higher educational institutions for persons with disabilities.  This Act also mandates free education for children with benchmark disabilities.  Which act is described?**

(a) The Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995
(b) The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016
(c) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(d) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description accurately highlights key features of the RPwD Act, 2016.  The other options relate to different social welfare legislation.  The 1995 Act was superseded by the 2016 Act.


**1.  Which entity is responsible for the centrally recognized categorization of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a) The National Commission for Scheduled Castes
(b) The Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(c) The National Human Rights Commission
(d) The Planning Commission of India

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare and development of tribal communities in India, including the identification and recognition of PVTGs.  The other options are incorrect. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes focuses on the welfare of Scheduled Castes. The National Human Rights Commission protects human rights, and the Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) focuses on national economic planning.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs, such as pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and declining population, are established and overseen by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. This demonstrates the Ministry's central role in recognizing and supporting these vulnerable groups.  Therefore, the correct answer is (b).


**2.  Which state in India has the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Jharkhand
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India, as per the provided information. While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, this question specifically asks about PVTGs, a subset of Scheduled Tribes. Chhattisgarh also has several PVTGs, sharing some with Madhya Pradesh, but Odisha holds the highest count. Jharkhand, while having a significant tribal population, does not have the highest number of PVTGs.  The data clearly indicates Odisha as the correct answer.


**3.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, later repealed, had what significant impact on the communities it targeted?**

(a) It provided them with land ownership rights.
(b) It facilitated their assimilation into mainstream society.
(c) It designated them as "born criminals."
(d) It ensured their access to education and healthcare.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was a deeply discriminatory law passed during the British Raj.  Its primary impact was the labeling of certain nomadic and semi-nomadic communities as "born criminals," leading to systemic oppression, marginalization, and denial of basic rights.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. The Act did not grant them land rights, nor did it aid their social integration or access to basic services; rather, it actively worked against these aspects. The act's legacy continues to affect the lives of Denotified Tribes (DNTs) even after its repeal. The lasting impact of this discriminatory legislation highlights the need for continued efforts towards their social justice and rehabilitation.


**4. Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High level of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) Declining or stagnant population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include a pre-agricultural level of technology, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  High literacy rates are not a characteristic of PVTGs; in fact, low literacy is a key indicator of their vulnerability. The other options accurately reflect the criteria used to identify these groups, emphasizing their socio-economic disadvantages and precarious demographic situation.  The contrast between low literacy and the other criteria highlights the specific vulnerabilities considered in the PVTG categorization.


**5. Which government initiative specifically aims to provide free competitive exam coaching to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) students?**

(a) Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme
(b) Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
(c) Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship
(d) National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) is a targeted initiative designed to uplift DNTs.  It includes provisions for free competitive exam coaching, aiming to improve their educational and employment prospects. While other schemes benefit DNTs, such as scholarships and hostel construction, SEED directly addresses their need for competitive exam preparation. The other options are incorrect because they do not specifically focus on providing free coaching for competitive exams.  The SEED scheme's focus on competitive exams reveals a specific strategy to address the socio-economic challenges faced by DNTs and improve their opportunities for upward mobility.


**6.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum reservation percentage for PwDs in which sector?**

(a) Police forces
(b) Government jobs
(c) Private sector employment
(d) Judiciary

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.  It explicitly excludes police forces from this reservation. The Act does not mandate reservations in the private sector or the judiciary.  The specific exclusion of police forces and the focus on government jobs highlight the Act's targeted approach to ensuring PwD inclusion in the public sector. This reflects a policy decision to prioritize employment opportunities within the government's control while acknowledging the unique operational requirements of law enforcement.


**7. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, makes it an offense to do which of the following?**

(a) Provide protective gear to sanitation workers.
(b) Construct sanitary latrines.
(c) Employ people to clean sewers without protective gear.
(d) Survey areas to identify manual scavengers.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Act criminalizes the employment of individuals to clean sewers and septic tanks without the provision of appropriate protective gear and equipment.  The other options are incorrect.  Providing protective gear is mandatory, constructing sanitary latrines is encouraged, and surveying for manual scavengers is a responsibility of local authorities.  The specific prohibition highlights the Act's focus on worker safety and the prevention of hazardous working conditions, addressing the serious health risks associated with manual scavenging.


**8.  Which government scheme provides concessional loans for procurement of sanitation-related equipment, aiming to reduce manual scavenging?**

(a) National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme
(b) Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)
(c) Swachhta Udyami Yojana
(d) PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Swachhta Udyami Yojana specifically targets the provision of concessional loans for purchasing sanitation-related equipment.  This scheme directly supports individuals involved in sanitation work, promoting safer and more efficient practices. The other options address different aspects of social welfare, such as child labor rehabilitation (NCLP and PENCIL) or alternative employment for manual scavengers (SRMS).  The focus on financial assistance for equipment underscores the government's strategy to promote mechanized sanitation as a means of eliminating manual scavenging.


**9. According to the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report, which of the following indicators is NOT directly addressed?**

(a) Child Stunting
(b) Child Wasting
(c) Total Fertility Rate
(d) Access to safe drinking water


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** While NFHS-5 collects data on various health indicators related to women and children, access to safe drinking water is primarily addressed through other surveys and reports related to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).  The NFHS primarily focuses on health and nutrition indicators directly related to maternal and child health, including stunting, wasting, and fertility rates.  The exclusion of a WASH indicator like safe drinking water in this context highlights the specific focus of the NFHS and the need for complementary data sources to gain a holistic understanding of public health.


**10. The  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education evaluates which of the following aspects at the state and district levels?**

(a) Higher education enrollment rates
(b) Adult literacy rates
(c) Effective classroom transaction and school safety
(d) National income per capita

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PGI assesses the performance of school education systems, focusing on outcomes, effective classroom transactions, and school safety.  It does not directly evaluate higher education enrollment, adult literacy, or national income. The inclusion of classroom transaction and school safety in the PGI's evaluation criteria highlights a shift towards a holistic assessment of school quality, going beyond simple measures of achievement and considering the overall learning environment.  This reflects a growing emphasis on the importance of safe and effective teaching practices in determining overall learning outcomes.


**11.  Which of the following is NOT a key feature of the National Credit Framework (NCrF)?**

(a) Seamless integration of credits earned from various educational pathways.
(b) A rigid structure with limited flexibility for credit transfers.
(c) Inclusion of school, higher, and vocational education credits.
(d) Promotion of lifelong learning through credit accumulation and transfer.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCrF is designed to provide flexibility and mobility in education, enabling seamless integration of credits from different educational pathways.  A rigid structure is the antithesis of the framework's core design.  The other options are key features, emphasizing the framework’s inclusiveness and its aim to foster lifelong learning.  The contrast between flexibility and rigidity highlights the fundamental difference between the NCrF's approach and traditional, inflexible educational systems.  This flexibility is crucial in providing learners with diverse pathways for skill development and career progression.


**12. The  National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, aims to provide strategic direction for research in which area?**

(a) Only pure sciences
(b) Natural sciences, engineering, technology, and social sciences interface.
(c) Exclusively humanities and social sciences
(d) Only defense and strategic technologies.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NRF Act, 2023, has a broad scope, encompassing natural sciences, engineering, technology, and the interface between scientific and technological fields and humanities and social sciences.  It does not limit itself to pure sciences, humanities and social sciences exclusively, or defence technologies alone. The inclusion of the humanities and social sciences interface demonstrates a recognition of the interdisciplinary nature of modern research and the need for a holistic approach to scientific advancement.  This integrated approach reflects a broader vision for research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.


**13.  Which international organization released the report titled ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022’ ?**

(a) World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c) International Labour Organization (ILO)
(d) World Bank

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNHCR, dedicated to protecting refugees and forcibly displaced people, released the report on global trends in forced displacement.  WHO focuses on health, ILO on labor, and the World Bank on economic development. The UNHCR's role in producing this report underscores its mandate to address the global challenge of forced migration, providing critical data and analysis to inform policy and humanitarian responses.  The specific focus on forced displacement highlights the organization's core concern with protecting vulnerable populations affected by conflict and persecution.


**14.  Which committee recommended reforms in India's higher education accreditation system, leading to a proposed transition to a binary accreditation system?**

(a) The Kasturirangan Committee
(b) The Yashpal Committee
(c) The Kothari Commission
(d) The Radhakrishnan Committee

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Radhakrishnan Committee's recommendations led to the proposed reforms in the higher education accreditation system in India, including the transition to a binary system (Accredited/Not Accredited). While other committees have contributed to educational reforms, the Radhakrishnan Committee directly addressed the accreditation process.  The recommendation for a binary accreditation system represents a significant change in the approach to quality assurance in higher education, aiming for greater clarity and transparency in assessing institutional performance.  This simpler system could improve efficiency and accountability in the accreditation process.


**15. The  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, categorizes India's hunger level as:**

(a) Low
(b) Moderate
(c) Serious
(d) Extremely alarming

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The GHI 2023 classifies India's hunger level as "Serious."  This reflects the country's relatively high levels of undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality, as indicated by the GHI score. While there might be ongoing debates about the methodology and data used in the GHI, the report's categorization remains a significant indicator of the nutritional challenges faced by the country.  The categorization of India's hunger level as "Serious" highlights the need for continued efforts to improve nutrition and food security across various sections of the population.


**1.  A global partnership established in 1971, focused on research for a food-secured future, is the parent organization of a major research center established in 1975.  Which organization is this global partnership?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
(c)  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question describes the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), a global partnership established in 1971.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), established in 1975, is explicitly mentioned as one of its major research centers in the provided text.  The World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) are separate organizations with different mandates.  Therefore, CGIAR is the correct answer as it fulfills all the criteria mentioned in the question.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding by linking two organizations based on their hierarchical relationship within the global food security landscape.


**2.  In 2022, a report titled 'Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report' highlighted a significant increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises. Which organization published this report?**

(a)  GANHRI
(b)  UNPFII
(c)  UNFPA
(d)  UNHCR


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) is the organization that published the 'Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report'.  The report's focus on forced displacement due to conflict, persecution, violence, and human rights violations, along with the mention of social and climate crises, aligns directly with the UNHCR's mandate.  GANHRI (Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions), UNPFII (UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues), and UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) have different areas of focus and are not associated with this specific report.  The question assesses factual recall and requires the candidate to identify the relevant organization based on the report's subject matter.


**3.  The Paris Principles, adopted in 1993 by the UN General Assembly, serve as standards for which type of institution globally?**

(a)  International Organizations focused on population issues.
(b)  National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs)
(c)  Institutions focused on indigenous peoples' rights.
(d)  Organizations involved in sustainable development goals monitoring.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Paris Principles, adopted in 1993, specifically provide standards for the development of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) worldwide.  These principles outline the criteria for independence, mandate, and functions of NHRIs. The other options are incorrect because the Paris Principles are not directly related to population issues, indigenous rights, or SDG monitoring, although some overlap may exist in practice.  The question tests factual recall and requires understanding of the specific focus of the Paris Principles.


**4.  A high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), established in 2000, deals with issues related to indigenous peoples. What is the name of this body?**

(a)  UNHCR
(b)  UNDESA
(c)  UNPFII
(d)  UNCRC


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is the high-level advisory body to ECOSOC that deals with indigenous issues.  Its mandate specifically includes economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights related to indigenous peoples.  The UNHCR, UNDESA, and UNCRC deal with refugees, sustainable development, and children's rights, respectively, making them irrelevant to the question's focus on indigenous issues.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the UN system's structure and the mandates of different bodies.


**5.  The 2019 amendment to India's Protection of Human Rights Act aimed to address concerns raised by which organization regarding the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)?**

(a)  UNPFII
(b)  UNHCR
(c)  GANHRI
(d)  UNDESA


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 2019 amendment to the Protection of Human Rights Act in India directly addressed concerns raised by GANHRI (Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions) regarding the NHRC's accreditation.  GANHRI had deferred the NHRC's accreditation due to issues like political interference in appointments and lack of diversity.  The other organizations mentioned are not directly involved in the accreditation process of the NHRC.  The question tests knowledge of Indian governance and its interaction with international bodies, specifically regarding human rights.


**6.  The 2023 report by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) utilized a framework aligned with global indicators and also included India-specific indicators. What is the name of this framework?**

(a)  Global Indicator Framework (GIF)
(b)  National Indicator Framework (NIF)
(c)  State Indicator Framework (SIF)
(d)  Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Indicator Framework (NIF) is the framework used by the MoSPI in its 2023 report on the SDGs.  The NIF incorporates both global indicators and those tailored to India's context.  The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) is a global standard, while the State Indicator Framework (SIF) is developed at the state level.  The IAEG-SDGs is the body responsible for creating the GIF, not the framework itself.  The question assesses knowledge of India's approach to SDG monitoring and its integration with global standards.


**7.  Which organization released the 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI), categorizing India as facing "Serious" hunger levels?**

(a)  World Bank
(b)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(c)  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI) was released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, two non-governmental organizations.  The report included India's ranking and assessment of its hunger situation. While other organizations like the World Bank, WHO, and IFPRI work on related issues, they were not the publishers of the specific 2023 GHI report. This question focuses on factual recall and the ability to link an organization to a specific publication.


**8.  The 'Triple Threat Report,' examining the combined challenges of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) for children, was published by which organization?**

(a)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  UNICEF
(c)  World Bank
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund) published the 'Triple Threat Report', focusing on the combined impact of WASH-related issues on children.  While WHO, World Bank, and IFPRI address various aspects of health and development, the specific report mentioned is attributed to UNICEF.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the organizations' mandates within the context of child health and well-being.


**9.  Which Indian Ministry is responsible for the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme, a key initiative aimed at improving the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers?**

(a)  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b)  Ministry of Rural Development
(c)  Ministry of Women and Child Development
(d)  Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) is responsible for the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme in India. This scheme is a significant part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program.  The other ministries mentioned have different areas of focus, making them incorrect.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the Indian government's organizational structure and responsibilities.


**10. The National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme is a joint initiative of which two Indian Ministries?**

(a)  Ministry of Rural Development and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b)  Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
(c)  Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ministry of Jal Shakti
(d)  Ministry of Panchayati Raj and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NAMASTE scheme is a joint effort between the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  This collaboration aims to promote mechanized sanitation, improving the safety and working conditions of sanitation workers. The other options incorrectly pair ministries not involved in this specific scheme.  The question tests knowledge of inter-ministerial collaborations within the Indian government's efforts towards sanitation and social justice.


**11.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, established a national board to oversee and monitor its implementation. What is the name of this board?**

(a)  State Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (SARTSB)
(b)  National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB)
(c)  National Commission for Women
(d)  National Human Rights Commission


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, created the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB). This board plays a crucial role in regulating surrogacy practices in India, ensuring ethical and safe procedures. The SARTSB is the state-level equivalent. The National Commission for Women and the National Human Rights Commission deal with different social issues, making them irrelevant to the question. The question tests factual recall about specific legislation and its implementing bodies.


**12. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, was amended in 2021 to expand access to abortion services under what circumstances?**

(a)  For all women up to 30 weeks of pregnancy
(b)  Specifically for married women facing financial hardship
(c)  In cases of rape, incest, or fetal abnormalities, extending the time limit under certain conditions
(d)  Only for women with life-threatening medical conditions


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 2021 amendment to the MTP Act broadened access to abortion services, particularly in cases of rape, incest, or fetal abnormalities.  The amendment increased the permissible gestational age for termination under specific circumstances, reflecting a more nuanced approach to reproductive healthcare rights. Options (a), (b), and (d) do not accurately reflect the scope of the 2021 amendment. The question tests knowledge of legal changes affecting reproductive rights in India.


**13.  Which Act repealed the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, which had labeled certain communities as "born criminals"?**

(a)  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(b)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(c)  The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952
(d)  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Habitual Offenders Act, 1952, repealed the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871.  The Criminal Tribes Act was a discriminatory law that unjustly stigmatized certain nomadic communities.  The other acts listed deal with different social issues and are not directly related to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act. This question tests knowledge of historical legislation and its impact on marginalized communities.

(d)  4%


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities.  This reservation aims to promote inclusivity and equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities in the workforce. The question tests knowledge of specific provisions within the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act.


**15.  Which High-Level Committee, established in 2021, developed the National Credit Framework (NCrF) for India's education system?**

(a)  The Kasturirangan Committee
(b)  The Radhakrishnan Committee
(c)  A committee formed under the aegis of the UGC
(d)  A committee specifically constituted for NCrF development


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** While several committees have been involved in educational reforms in India, the National Credit Framework (NCrF) was specifically developed by a High-Level Committee constituted for that purpose in 2021.  The Kasturirangan Committee worked on the National Curriculum Framework, and the Radhakrishnan Committee focused on higher education accreditation.  The question assesses understanding of the specific committees and their respective mandates within the context of Indian education reforms.

(a)  30%
(b)  40%
(c)  50%
(d)  60%


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NEP 2020 aims to achieve a 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education by 2035. This ambitious target reflects the policy's focus on expanding access to higher education across the country.  The question tests knowledge of the key targets and goals outlined in the NEP 2020.


**17. According to the NFHS-5 (2019-2021), which Indian state reported the highest percentage of spousal abuse among ever-married women aged 18-49 years?**

(a)  Bihar
(b)  Telangana
(c)  Manipur
(d)  Karnataka


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The NFHS-5 data indicates that Karnataka reported the highest percentage of spousal abuse among ever-married women in the 18-49 age group.  While other states also showed significant levels of spousal violence, Karnataka had the highest reported incidence according to this survey.  The question tests factual recall of data from a specific social survey.


**18.  Which international treaty recognizes the right to a world of work free from violence and harassment, including gender-based violence and harassment, a convention India has not yet ratified?**

(a)  UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)
(b)  ILO Convention 190
(c)  Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(d)  Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** ILO Convention 190 is the international treaty that specifically addresses the right to a world of work free from violence and harassment.  This convention is significant for its comprehensive approach to workplace safety and gender equality.  While CEDAW, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and CRC address related issues, ILO Convention 190 is the most direct and specific answer to the question's prompt.  The question tests knowledge of international labor standards and their implications for gender equality.


**19.  The Boeing Sukanya Program aims to support the entry of which specific demographic into India's aviation sector?**

(a)  Men from marginalized communities
(b)  Young women from across India
(c)  Individuals with disabilities
(d)  Senior citizens


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Boeing Sukanya Program is specifically designed to encourage young women from across India to enter the aviation sector.  This program focuses on providing opportunities in STEM fields and training for aviation-related jobs. The question tests knowledge of specific initiatives aimed at promoting gender equality within a particular industry.


**20.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, replaced which existing statutory body in India?**

(a)  National Assessment Centre, PARAKH
(b)  National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)
(c)  Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
(d)  University Grants Commission (UGC)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, subsumed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) into the newly formed NRF.  SERB was a previously existing statutory body responsible for funding and promoting research in science and engineering. The other options are incorrect as they are independent organizations with different mandates.  The question tests knowledge of recent legislative changes in India's science and technology policy.



**1.  Which organization, established in 1971, is a global partnership dedicated to research for a food-secured future and has a major research center, established in 1975, that works in over 60 countries, including India?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)
(c) United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(d) United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on identifying the parent organization of a specific research institute and its global reach. Option (b), CGIAR, accurately describes the global partnership established in 1971, engaged in research for food security.  It correctly identifies IFPRI, established in 1975, as one of its major research centers and notes its operational presence in over 60 countries, including India. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they represent different international organizations with distinct mandates unrelated to the described research partnership and its affiliated institute.  WFP focuses on food assistance, UNDESA on economic and social affairs, and UNFPA on population and reproductive health.  Therefore, only CGIAR aligns perfectly with all the specified details.


**2.  A 2023 report from which organization highlighted a rise in food insecurity between 2020 and 2022 due to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical instability?  This report also projected an increase of 72 million undernourished people by 2050 due to climate change.**

(a) World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(c)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The key to answering this question lies in recognizing the specific content of the report.  The description points to a report focusing on food insecurity, its causes (pandemic, climate change, geopolitical factors), and a projection related to climate change's impact on undernourishment.  This aligns precisely with the IFPRI's 2023 Global Food Policy Report, which addressed these issues. The other options are incorrect because they either don't typically produce reports on these specific topics (WHO, FAO) or focus on different areas such as refugee displacement (UNHCR). The precise details of the report's content—food insecurity, multiple crises, and the climate change projection—directly point to IFPRI's report.



**3. Which international organization, headquartered in Geneva, released a 2022 report detailing a 21% increase in forced displacement worldwide compared to 2021, with 30% of those displaced being children?**

(a)  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
(b)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(c)  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
(d)  UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on an organization's report concerning forced displacement, its percentage increase, and the proportion of children among the displaced.  This directly refers to the UNHCR's "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report," which detailed these statistics. The other options are incorrect because they have different mandates. UNDESA focuses on broader economic and social development goals, GANHRI on human rights institution accreditation, and UNCRC on children's rights.  The specific data on forced displacement—the percentage increase and the proportion of children—pinpoint the UNHCR report as the correct answer.


**4.  The deferral of accreditation of which Indian institution by GANHRI in 2023 was attributed to concerns about political interference in appointments, involvement of police in human rights violation probes, and poor cooperation with civil society?**

(a) National Commission for Women (NCW)
(b) National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC)
(c) National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
(d) National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question centers on a specific Indian institution facing accreditation deferral by GANHRI due to stated concerns.  The details provided—political interference, police involvement in investigations, and lack of cooperation with civil society—directly relate to the NHRC's deferral of accreditation.  The other options are incorrect as they are different commissions with distinct mandates and functions.  The specific issues cited for the deferral—political interference, police involvement, and civil society cooperation—unambiguously point to the NHRC as the correct answer.


**5. Which UN body, established in 2000, comprises 16 independent experts (8 nominated by governments and 8 by indigenous organizations) and advises the UN Economic and Social Council on indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, the environment, education, health, and human rights?**

(a) UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
(b) UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
(c) UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)
(d) UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes a UN body with a specific composition (16 independent experts, with representation from governments and indigenous organizations) and mandate (advising on indigenous issues across multiple sectors).  This precisely matches the UNPFII. The other options are incorrect as they have different focuses. The UNCRC deals with children's rights, the UNCPD with population issues, and UNDESA with broader economic and social affairs. The unique structure and mandate of the described body—the composition of experts and the range of indigenous issues covered—clearly point to the UNPFII.


**6. Which ministry in India is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), a program that aims to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) and ODF Plus status in villages?**

(a) Ministry of Rural Development
(b) Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation
(b) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(d) Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The question directly asks about the ministry responsible for the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) and its ODF goals.  The Ministry of Rural Development is the nodal ministry for this program.  The other options are incorrect because they have different primary areas of responsibility.  The direct link between the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) and its objectives (ODF and ODF Plus) with the Ministry of Rural Development makes it the clear and unambiguous answer.


**7.  Which Indian Act, repealed in 1952, had previously categorized certain communities as “criminal tribes,” leading to their marginalization and stigmatization?**

(a) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(b) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(c) The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
(d) The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question specifically asks about the historical Act that labeled certain communities as "criminal tribes."  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 is the correct answer.  This act had deeply negative consequences for the targeted communities. The other options are incorrect because they address different social issues—domestic violence, atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Tribes, and bonded labor. The specific historical context of the question—the labeling of communities as "criminal tribes"—directly points to the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871.


**8. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates which percentage of reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in government jobs?**

(a) 2%
(b) 3%
(c) 4%
(d) 5%

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly asks about the reservation percentage for persons with benchmark disabilities under the RPwD Act, 2016. The Act mandates a 4% reservation in government jobs.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not reflect the legally mandated reservation percentage. The precise numerical detail requested—the reservation percentage—makes the answer unambiguous.  Note that this reservation does not apply to police forces.


**9. Which organization jointly prepared the “Path to Equal” report, introducing the Women’s Empowerment Index (WEI) and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) to measure women's empowerment and gender equality worldwide?**

(a) World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF)
(b) UN Women and UNDP
(c) World Economic Forum (WEF) and UN Women
(d)  World Health Organization (WHO) and UN Women

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the organization(s) behind a specific report and its indices measuring women's empowerment. The "Path to Equal" report, with its WEI and GGPI, was jointly produced by UN Women and UNDP. The other options are incorrect. While other organizations might publish reports on gender equality, the specific report and indices mentioned are directly attributable to UN Women and UNDP.  The unique combination of the report title and the indices mentioned makes this answer unambiguous.


**10. Which ministry launched the national Anganwadi Protocol for Divyang Children, a program aimed at tracking and supporting children with disabilities, incorporating a social model of inclusive care under the POSHAN Abhiyan?**

(a) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(b) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(c) Ministry of Women and Child Development
(d) Ministry of Education

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question asks about the ministry responsible for a specific program targeting children with disabilities within the Anganwadi system and POSHAN Abhiyan. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is responsible for launching this protocol. The other options are incorrect as their mandates do not directly align with the program's focus on children's welfare and nutrition within the Anganwadi framework. The details of the program—Anganwadi protocol, Divyang children, POSHAN Abhiyan—clearly point to the Ministry of Women and Child Development.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring detailed knowledge and understanding of the concepts.

**1.  A global partnership established in 1971, focused on research for a food-secure future, is the parent organization of a major research center established in 1975 that provides research-based policy solutions for reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.  This research center, operating in over 60 countries including India, recently released a report highlighting a surge in food prices. Which organization is this research center?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
(c)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(d)  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question describes the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).  The prompt clearly states that IFPRI, established in 1975, is a major research center of the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR), a global partnership established in 1971.  IFPRI's mandate aligns perfectly with the description: reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition through research-based policy solutions.  The mention of a recent report on food price surges further strengthens the connection. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because their mandates and focuses differ significantly from the description provided.  WFP focuses on food aid and emergency response, UNFPA on reproductive health, and UNDESA on broader economic and social development issues.


**2.  A 2023 report, released by two non-governmental organizations based in Ireland and Germany, reveals that a South Asian nation ranks 111th among 125 countries in a specific index due to high levels of undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.  This ranking reflects a concerning lack of progress in addressing a critical social issue. Which index is this report related to?**

(a)  Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)
(b)  Gender Inequality Index (GII)
(c)  Global Hunger Index (GHI)
(d)  Human Development Index (HDI)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description points to the Global Hunger Index (GHI). The question explicitly mentions the ranking of a South Asian nation (India, implicitly) based on indicators of undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality—all key components of the GHI. The report's release by Concern Worldwide (Ireland) and Welt Hunger Hilfe (Germany) further confirms this.  The other indices focus on different aspects: MPI on multiple deprivations, GII on gender disparities, and HDI on overall human development.  These do not directly address the specific indicators mentioned in the question.


**3.  An amendment to the Protection of Human Rights Act in 2019 aimed to address concerns raised by a global alliance of national human rights institutions regarding a specific national commission's accreditation.  These concerns included political interference in appointments and poor cooperation with civil society. Which national commission was this amendment related to?**

(a)  National Commission for Women (NCW)
(b)  National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC)
(c)  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
(d)  National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).  The text directly states that the GANHRI (Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions) deferred the NHRC's accreditation due to concerns about political interference and lack of cooperation with civil society. The 2019 amendment to the Protection of Human Rights Act was a direct response to these concerns.  The other options are incorrect; while they are also important national commissions, the text explicitly connects the 2019 amendment and the accreditation concerns to the NHRC.


**4.  A report titled "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report," released by an organization established in 1950 and headquartered in Geneva, revealed a significant increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises. This organization works to save lives, protect rights, and build a better future for people forced to flee their homes. Which organization released this report?**

(a)  International Organization for Migration (IOM)
(b)  Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
(c)  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d)  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description clearly points to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The report title, "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report," directly aligns with UNHCR's mandate of protecting refugees and assisting those displaced by conflict and persecution. The establishment date (1950) and headquarters location (Geneva) further confirm the identity of the organization.  While other organizations address migration or human rights issues, only UNHCR's focus matches the specific description of the report and its mandate.


**5.  A 2023 report, released in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), examines demographic trends in a specific nation, including its status as the world's most populous country and its relatively young population.  The report highlights key indicators such as fertility rates and life expectancy. Which organization released this report?**

(a)  World Bank
(b)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
(c)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(d)  International Labour Organization (ILO)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** This question highlights the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).  The description clearly indicates the report's focus on population and demographic trends, specifically mentioning a collaboration with IIPS and key indicators like fertility rates and life expectancy.  These all fall squarely within UNFPA's mandate.  The other organizations, while involved in development work, do not have the same specific focus on population dynamics and demographic analysis.


**6.  A recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) highlights the significant impact of inadequate access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services on global health, with a substantial percentage of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to unsafe WASH. Which term best encapsulates the collective term for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene?**

(a)  Public Health Infrastructure
(b)  Environmental Sustainability
(c) WASH
(d)  Sanitary Services


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly defines the term WASH as a collective term for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene. The WHO report's focus on the health impact of inadequate WASH services reinforces this. The other options are too broad or do not specifically encompass the three components of WASH.


**7.  The Bihar state government recently released a report on a survey focused on caste demographics.  While the census is a Union subject, this exercise was described as a "social survey." Which type of survey was conducted in Bihar?**

(a)  Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC)
(b)  National Family Health Survey (NFHS)
(c)  A state-specific caste survey
(d)  National Sample Survey (NSS)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question clearly describes a state-specific caste survey conducted in Bihar. The text explicitly mentions that the Bihar government conducted a caste survey, distinct from the national SECC which was conducted earlier, and which did not include caste data in its published version. The other options represent national surveys with different focuses.


**8.  The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) launched a national protocol for children with disabilities, integrating a social model of inclusive care under a specific national nutrition program. This protocol includes screening for early disability signs, inclusion in community events, and referral support.  Which national nutrition program is this protocol associated with?**

(a)  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
(b)  National Food Security Mission (NFSM)
(c)  POSHAN Abhiyan
(d)  Mid-Day Meal Scheme

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The protocol is associated with POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission).  The text directly links the protocol to the POSHAN Abhiyan, emphasizing its focus on inclusive care for children with disabilities. The other options are related to nutrition or child welfare but do not directly align with the description of the protocol's implementation within a national nutrition program.



**9.  A parliamentary standing committee report highlighted the need for improved implementation of a policy aimed at eliminating a specific form of child exploitation by 2025.  This form of exploitation involves work that deprives children of their childhood and is harmful to their development. Which type of child exploitation is the report concerned with?**

(a)  Child marriage
(b)  Child trafficking
(c)  Child labour
(d)  Child sexual abuse


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The report is concerned with child labour. The description clearly defines the issue as work that deprives children of their childhood and potential, which is the core definition of child labour.  While other forms of child exploitation exist, only child labour directly aligns with the committee's stated focus on eliminating a specific type of exploitative work.


**10.  The Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports recently suspended a national sports federation due to its disregard for rules and regulations. Sports in India are listed under Entry 33 of List II in the Constitution of India, placing them under the domain of the federal states. Which entity is responsible for the overall promotion of sports training in India?**

(a)  Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)
(b)  Indian Olympic Association (IOA)
(c)  Sports Authority of India (SAI)
(d)  Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MYAS)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Sports Authority of India (SAI) is primarily responsible for the promotion of sports training. While the MYAS provides overall policy direction, SAI is the operational arm responsible for the actual implementation of sports training programs across India. The IOA is primarily concerned with Olympic sports, and the BCCI deals only with cricket.


**1.  Which entity officially recognized Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in 1973, initially designating them under a different name?**

(a) The United Nations
(b) The Planning Commission of India
(c) The Government of India
(d) The National Human Rights Commission

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The Government of India first recognized PVTGs in 1973, initially calling them Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs). This recognition was based on recommendations from the U.N. Dhebar Commission (1961).  The UN plays a role in advocating for indigenous rights globally, but the official recognition and categorization within India's administrative structure were undertaken by the Indian government. The Planning Commission, while involved in development planning, didn't directly classify these groups.  The National Human Rights Commission focuses on human rights violations, not tribal group classification.  Therefore, the correct answer is (c). The question tests factual recall and understanding of the Indian administrative structure regarding tribal welfare.


**2.  A specific semi-nomadic tribal group from Karnataka, mentioned in the context of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, is:**

(a) Baiga
(b) Bharia
(c) Hakki Pikki
(d) Konda Reddi

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly names the Hakki Pikki tribe as a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka.  The other options, Baiga, Bharia, and Konda Reddi, are mentioned in the context of PVTGs and nomadic communities but not specifically as semi-nomadic groups from Karnataka. This question assesses factual recall of specific tribal groups and their geographical locations, demanding precise knowledge rather than general understanding of tribal communities in India.


**3. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), mandates a minimum reservation percentage for PwDs in which of the following sectors?**

(a) Private Sector employment
(b)  Government jobs and Government/Government-aided higher educational institutions
(c)  Police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UTs police)
(d)  The judiciary

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The RPwD Act, 2016, explicitly mandates a minimum 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs and not less than 5% reservation in government and government-aided higher educational institutions. The Act specifically excludes police forces from this reservation policy.  Private sector employment is not covered under this act's reservation provisions.  The judiciary is not explicitly mentioned in the context of this reservation policy within the provided text. This question tests the understanding of specific provisions within a key piece of legislation related to disability rights in India.


**4. Which Ministry is responsible for implementing the Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)?**

(a) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
(d) Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the SEED scheme is launched by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. The other ministries mentioned are involved in various social welfare programs but are not responsible for the specific SEED initiative.  This question tests factual recall regarding the administrative responsibility for a particular government scheme aimed at empowering marginalized communities.


**5.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is primarily tasked with:**

(a) Providing financial assistance to DNT families.
(b)  Preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
(c)  Implementing rehabilitation programs for manual scavengers.
(d)  Monitoring the implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the NCDNT's primary role is to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs. While other agencies handle financial assistance, rehabilitation programs, and monitoring the Forest Rights Act, the NCDNT's mandate is focused on the accurate identification and categorization of DNT communities. This question tests factual recall of the specific functions of a key government commission related to the welfare of marginalized communities.


**6. Which committee's report, highlighted by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), recommended the establishment of a permanent commission for De-Notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs) in India?**

(a)  The Swaran Singh Committee
(b)  The Kothari Committee
(c)  The Idate Commission
(d)  The Gadgil Committee

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage specifically mentions the NHRC's emphasis on implementing the Idate Commission's report, which recommended creating a permanent commission for DNTs. The other committees mentioned in the text deal with different aspects of governance and policy, such as education and the protection of the Western Ghats. This question tests the ability to recall specific committees and their recommendations related to social justice and the welfare of marginalized groups in India.


**7.  The practice of removing human excreta by hand from sewers or septic tanks, prohibited under a specific Act, is known as:**

(a)  Child Labour
(b)  Manual Scavenging
(c)  Forced Displacement
(d)  Altruistic Surrogacy

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text defines manual scavenging as the practice of removing human excreta by hand from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits. This practice is explicitly banned under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR). The other options represent distinct social issues. This question tests the understanding of specific terminology related to sanitation and social justice issues in India.


**8.  The  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) makes it an offense to:**

(a)  Provide training in alternative employment to manual scavengers.
(b)  Construct community sanitary latrines.
(c)  Employ people to clean sewers and septic tanks without protective gear.
(d)  Implement mechanized sanitation systems.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act explicitly criminalizes the employment of individuals to clean sewers and septic tanks without proper protective gear and equipment.  The Act aims to eliminate manual scavenging and promotes the use of safe and mechanized sanitation systems.  Providing training and constructing sanitary latrines are positive measures under the Act, not offenses.  This question tests the understanding of specific legal provisions aimed at protecting the rights and safety of manual scavengers.


**9.  The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to:**

(a)  Increase the number of insanitary latrines.
(b)  Eliminate hazardous cleaning and ensure the safety and dignity of sewer and septic tank workers.
(c)  Promote the use of child labor in sanitation work.
(d)  Reduce the use of protective gear during sanitation work.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem explicitly aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices, prevent deaths among sanitation workers, and ensure their safety and dignity. The policy promotes the use of mechanized sanitation systems to prevent manual scavenging. This question tests the understanding of government policies aimed at improving sanitation practices and worker safety.


**10. The  highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India is found in:**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c)  Andaman and Nicobar Islands
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. While Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have significant PVTG populations, Odisha has a larger number. This question tests factual recall related to the geographical distribution of PVTGs in India.


**11.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Pre-agricultural level of technology
(b) High level of literacy
(c) Economic backwardness
(d) A declining or stagnant population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text lists pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population as criteria for identifying PVTGs. High literacy levels would contradict the vulnerability criteria. This question tests understanding of the criteria used to define a particularly vulnerable tribal group.


**12. The  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) is a high-level advisory body to:**

(a) The World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) The United Nations General Assembly
(c) The United Nations Economic and Social Council (UNECOSOC)
(d) The International Labour Organization (ILO)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that UNPFII is a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (UNECOSOC).  The other organizations mentioned play important roles in global governance but are not the direct recipients of UNPFII's advisory function. This question tests factual recall regarding the organizational structure and functions within the UN system related to indigenous issues.


**13. The  'Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report' was released by:**

(a) The World Bank
(b) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c) The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
(d) The International Monetary Fund (IMF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text specifically attributes the release of the 'Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report' to the UNHCR. The other organizations mentioned are involved in development and economic issues but not directly related to this specific report. This question tests factual recall of reports and their issuing organizations, relevant to understanding global migration patterns.


**14.  Which organization is responsible for releasing the Global Hunger Index (GHI)?**

(a)  The World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe
(d) The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text states that the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.  While WFP, FAO, and IFPRI are involved in food security and related issues, they are not the organizations that release the GHI. This question tests factual recall regarding the specific organizations responsible for compiling and releasing a key global index.


**15.  The  'India Ageing Report 2023' was jointly released by UNFPA and:**

(a)  The World Bank
(b)  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
(c)  The International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
