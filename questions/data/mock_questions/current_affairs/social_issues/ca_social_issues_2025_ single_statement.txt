This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of health data frameworks.


**2.  The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC), produced annually, is a publication of which organization?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
(d)  Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that the GRFC is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). While the WFP and FAO are involved in the GNAFC which launched the report, they are not the direct publishers.  The GNAFC itself is a collaborative network, not the publishing entity. This question tests factual recall of organizations and their publications.


**3.  Which of the following is NOT a parameter used in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)?**

(a) Teaching, Learning, and Resources
(b) Research and Professional Practices
(c)  Graduation Outcomes
(d)  Financial Sustainability


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NIRF parameters explicitly listed are Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.  Financial sustainability, while important for institutional health, is not among the ranking criteria.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify information not present in the text.


**4. Which organization is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), one of the indicators under SDG 12.3?**

(a)  UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
(b)  Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP)
(c)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(d)  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI).  UNEP and WRAP are involved in the Food Waste Index Report, but not the FLI. GAIN focuses on nutrition. This question tests factual recall regarding international organizations and their roles in SDG indicators.


**5.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to address critical gaps in which of the following areas for tribal communities?**

(a)  Housing and Infrastructure only
(b) Social Infrastructure, Health, and Education only
(c) Livelihood and Skill Development only
(d) Social Infrastructure, Health, Education, and Livelihood


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The description of PM-JUGA explicitly states that it aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence and outreach of different schemes.  The options that only partially list these areas are therefore incorrect. This tests conceptual understanding of the scheme's objectives.


**6.  The draft guidelines for the withdrawal of life support in terminally ill patients, referring to Passive Euthanasia, were recently released by which Indian ministry?**

(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
(b) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(c) Ministry of Law and Justice
(d)  Ministry of AYUSH


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage directly states that the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare released the draft guidelines for passive euthanasia.  The other ministries are not involved in this specific area of healthcare policy.  This question tests factual recall concerning government ministries and their responsibilities.

(a) National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
(b)  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)
(c)  National Education Policy (NEP)
(d)  Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage describes "PAIR" (Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research) as a key initiative under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF).  While related to NEP's goals, it's a specific ANRF program.  MAHA is another ANRF initiative, not the overarching program for PAIR.  This question tests understanding of the structure and components of a national research program.


**8.  The  "One person, one vote" principle is a key characteristic of which type of financial institution in India?**

(a) Scheduled Commercial Banks
(b)  Cooperative Banks
(c)  Small Finance Banks
(d)  Payment Banks


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly mentions that cooperative banks operate on the principle of "one person, one vote" in decision-making.  This is not a characteristic of other bank types mentioned.  This question tests factual recall of specific features of different Indian banking systems.


**9.  Which international agreement defines countries' rights and obligations in handling cross-border public health emergencies?**

(a)  The Kyoto Protocol
(b)  The Paris Agreement
(c)  The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005
(d)  The Convention on Biological Diversity


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, is a legally binding framework defining countries' responsibilities in managing cross-border public health events.  The other options are unrelated international agreements. This question tests factual recall of international treaties and their subject matter.


**10.  The  "Golden Ripe" or "Super Sweet" pineapple variety, known for its ease of processing and extended shelf life, is identified as:**

(a)  Queen Pineapple
(b)  Smooth Cayenne Pineapple
(c)  MD 2 Pineapple
(d)  Perolera Pineapple


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly identifies the MD 2 pineapple as also known as "Golden Ripe" or "Super Sweet," highlighting its processing advantages and longer shelf life.  The other options are different pineapple varieties. This question tests factual recall regarding specific agricultural products.



**1.  A global initiative aimed at improving coordination and guidance for tackling the root causes of food crises, involving governments, international organizations, and NGOs, was launched in 2016 at the World Humanitarian Summit. Which entity is this initiative associated with?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
(c) European Union
(d) Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) is the correct answer.  The question describes the GNAFC's core functions and its origins, directly aligning with its stated purpose of better linking and guiding initiatives to address food crisis root causes.  The GNAFC, launched in 2016 at the World Humanitarian Summit, brings together various stakeholders (governments, international organizations, and NGOs) to improve humanitarian responses and reduce acute food insecurity. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all involved in the GNAFC but are not the initiative itself. The WFP and FAO are UN agencies that participate in the GNAFC's efforts, while the European Union is a founding partner.  However, the GNAFC is the overarching network coordinating these individual entities' actions.  Understanding the distinction between the coordinating body and its constituent members is crucial for a thorough grasp of global food security initiatives.


**2.  Which UN convention, adopted in New York in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities?**

(a) Biwako Millennium Framework
(b) Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region
(c) UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)
(d)  Incheon Strategy “To make the Right Real” for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and Pacific

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is the correct answer. The question directly describes the convention's objective and key details, including its adoption date and entry into force. The UN-CRPD explicitly focuses on promoting, protecting, and ensuring the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities.  The other options represent related initiatives but do not encompass the comprehensive framework of the UN-CRPD. The Biwako Millennium Framework and the Incheon Strategy are regional frameworks related to disability rights, while the Declaration is a statement of principles.  The UN-CRPD, however, is a legally binding international treaty. Understanding the hierarchical relationship between international conventions and regional or thematic initiatives is key to comprehending the global landscape of disability rights advocacy.


**3.  A scheme launched in 2023 aims to empower three crore women by achieving an annual household income of at least ₹1 lakh.  This initiative is associated with which government program?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
(b) Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM)
(c) Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
(d)  Ayushman Bharat Card

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM). The question describes the "Lakhpati Didi" initiative, which is explicitly stated as an outcome of the DAY-NRLM.  This program aims to empower women through self-help groups (SHGs) and enhance their economic standing. While the other options represent significant government initiatives focusing on financial inclusion (Jan Dhan Yojana), rural housing (PM Awas Yojana), and health insurance (Ayushman Bharat), they are not directly linked to the Lakhpati Didi initiative.  Recognizing the specific program under which a particular scheme falls is vital for understanding the Indian government's social and economic development strategies. The focus on SHGs and the income target clearly points to the DAY-NRLM's objectives.


**4.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), launched in 2015 by the Ministry of Education, uses a methodology to rank educational institutions based on several parameters.  Which organization is responsible for implementing the NIRF?**

(a) Ministry of Education
(b) INFLIBNET Centre
(c) National Board of Accreditation (NBA)
(d)  Times Higher Education (THE)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c), the National Board of Accreditation (NBA). The question specifies the implementing agency for the NIRF. While the Ministry of Education launched the NIRF and sets the overall framework, the NBA, in collaboration with INFLIBNET, is responsible for its practical implementation. The NBA's role in assessing the qualitative competence of programs offered by educational institutions aligns with the NIRF's aim to rank institutions.  Option (a) is incorrect because the Ministry oversees but doesn't directly implement the rankings. Option (b) is partially correct, as INFLIBNET collaborates, but the NBA is the primary implementing body. Option (d) is irrelevant as THE is a global ranking organization, not involved in the NIRF.  Understanding the division of labor between the initiating body and the implementing agency is crucial for comprehending the operational aspects of Indian educational rankings.


**5.  A report focusing on financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition, published by an international organization, introduces a new definition of financing for food security and nutrition.  Which report is this?**

(a) Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)
(b) Food Waste Index Report 2024
(c) State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024
(d)  National Health Accounts Estimates for India

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c), the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024.  The question highlights the report's theme, which directly matches the description of the 2024 report's focus on financing to address hunger and malnutrition.  The report is known for its comprehensive analysis and introduction of new definitions related to food security financing. Option (a) focuses on food crises, while option (b) concentrates on food waste. Option (d) is irrelevant as it deals with health expenditure in India, not global food security.  Understanding the scope and specific focus of various reports on global food security is crucial for analyzing strategies to combat hunger and malnutrition.  The emphasis on a new definition of financing in the question strongly points to the State of Food Security and Nutrition report.


**6.  Which Act, enacted in 2006, grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) under a specific section?**

(a) National Policy for PwDs 2006
(b) Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006
(c)  Mental Healthcare Act, 2017
(d)  Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b), the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA). The question explicitly mentions habitat rights and PVTGs, directly linking it to the FRA.  Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA specifically addresses habitat rights for PVTGs.  The other options are related to different aspects of social welfare and legislation but do not concern habitat rights for PVTGs. The FRA is a landmark legislation that acknowledges the rights of tribal communities to their traditional forest lands, including habitat rights.  Understanding the specific provisions of the FRA is crucial for analyzing policies related to indigenous rights and forest conservation.  The question's precision in mentioning PVTGs and habitat rights clearly points to the FRA.


**7.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in various sectors.  From which source does the scheme primarily receive its funding?**

(a)  PM Awas Yojana (Gramin)
(b)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
(c)  Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants
(d)  Ayushman Bharat

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c), Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.  The question clearly states that PM-JUGA focuses on improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  The text explicitly mentions that the funding for PM-JUGA comes from existing DAPST grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent separate government schemes focused on housing, education, and health respectively, and are not the primary funding source for PM-JUGA.  Understanding the funding mechanisms of government schemes is crucial for evaluating their implementation and impact. The explicit mention of DAPST grants in the context of PM-JUGA funding directly leads to the correct answer.


**8.  Which global university ranking system uses nine performance indicators to assess universities, and in its 2025 edition, ranked the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) as the top-ranked Indian institution?**

(a) Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings
(b)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
(c)  QS World University Rankings
(d)  University Impact Rankings

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c), QS World University Rankings. The question describes the ranking system's methodology (nine performance indicators) and mentions IIT-B's ranking, which aligns with the QS World University Rankings.  The QS rankings are widely recognized for their comprehensive assessment of universities using multiple indicators.  Option (a) uses a different number of indicators and has a different ranking for IIT-B. Option (b) is a national ranking system, not a global one. Option (d) focuses on universities' impact on UN Sustainable Development Goals.  Understanding the differences between various global university ranking systems is crucial for interpreting the relative performance of educational institutions worldwide. The specific details in the question about the number of indicators and the mentioned institution's ranking directly point to the QS system.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the individual's knowledge base.

**1.  A global initiative aiming to eliminate doping in sports, ratified by India, and the only international treaty in its domain, is:**

(a) The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code
(b) The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985
(c) The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport
(d) The National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) of India's Play True Campaign


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport is explicitly identified in the text as the only international treaty aimed at eliminating doping in sports.  It was adopted in Paris in 2005 and aims to harmonize anti-doping legislation globally.  While WADA plays a crucial role in global anti-doping efforts, it is not a treaty but an independent foundation.  The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, deals with drug control within a nation, not specifically sports doping. The Play True Campaign is a specific initiative by NADA, not an international treaty.  The question highlights the importance of understanding the distinction between international conventions and national legislation or campaigns within a specific domain.



**2. The process involving the written consent of parties, ideally within 48 hours, to certify a course of action concerning the withdrawal of life support in terminally ill patients, is primarily governed by:**

(a) The Clinical Ethics Committee's oversight
(b) The Secondary Medical Board's validation
(c) The Primary Medical Board's certification
(d) The Supreme Court's directives in the Common Cause vs. Union of India case


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage directly states that the Primary Medical Board (PMB), upon receiving written consent, certifies the course of action within 48 hours.  While the other options are involved in the process, they are not the primary governing body for this specific step. The Clinical Ethics Committee provides oversight and conflict resolution, the Secondary Medical Board validates the PMB's decision, and the Supreme Court's directives provide the legal framework, but the actual certification is the responsibility of the PMB.  This question tests the ability to identify the key actor in a multi-step process related to a sensitive healthcare issue.


**3.  A scheme launched by the Prime Minister aiming to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, named after a tribal leader who resisted the British Empire, is:**

(a) PM-JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan)
(b)  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(c)  DAPST (Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes)
(d) Swadesh Darshan


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly identifies Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) as the scheme launched by the Prime Minister with the stated objective.  While PM-JANMAN provided learnings and the DAPST provides funding, PM-JUGA is the specific scheme in question.  Swadesh Darshan is a separate program focused on tourism, mentioned in relation to a component of PM-JUGA, not the core scheme itself. The question assesses the ability to differentiate between various government schemes aimed at tribal welfare, testing knowledge of specific program names and objectives.


**4. The Act which provides legal provisions for the care and protection of children at imminent risk of marriage before reaching the legal age, and is mentioned in relation to preventing child marriages, is:**

(a) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005
(b) The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023
(c) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(d) The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text specifically mentions the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, in the context of preventing child marriages.  While the other Acts deal with related issues (domestic violence, legal framework, and abortion), only the Juvenile Justice Act directly addresses the care and protection of children at risk of early marriage.  This question tests the understanding of interlinked legislation dealing with children's rights and welfare in India.


**5.  The international convention adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, aiming to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for people with disabilities, and to which India is a signatory, is:**

(a) The Incheon Strategy
(b) The Biwako Millennium Framework
(c) The Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region
(d) The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, with the objective of promoting the rights of people with disabilities.  While the other options are related initiatives, only the UN-CRPD fulfills all the criteria mentioned in the question.  This question assesses knowledge of specific international human rights conventions and their key features.



**6.  The mechanism established to address the needs and priorities of developing countries in managing public health emergencies, as a result of amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, is:**

(a) The States Parties Committee
(b) National IHR Authorities
(c) A Coordinating Financial Mechanism
(d) The World Health Assembly (WHA)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the IHR 2005, as described in the text, specifically mention the establishment of a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to support developing countries.  The other options are also part of the amended IHR but do not directly address financial needs. The States Parties Committee is for implementation, National IHR Authorities improve coordination, and the WHA is the decision-making body. This question tests the understanding of specific mechanisms within international public health frameworks.


**7. The  Act that was amended in 2021 to increase the time period within which abortion may be carried out, under certain conditions is:**

(a) The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023
(b) The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(c) The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971
(d) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions the MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, which amended the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, to extend the permissible time frame for abortions.  This question focuses on specific legislative changes in India relating to reproductive healthcare.


**8.  The body responsible for determining the policies of the World Health Organization (WHO), appointing the Director-General, and supervising financial policies, is the:**

(a)  The Primary Medical Board (PMB)
(b) The World Health Assembly (WHA)
(c) The States Parties Committee
(d) The National IHR Authorities


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that the World Health Assembly (WHA) is the decision-making body of the WHO with the responsibilities listed in the question.  This question tests basic knowledge about the structure and functions of international health organizations.

(a) ASMITA Project
(b) Bahubhasha Shabdkosh
(c) Real-time Translation Architecture
(d) Project NAMAN


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly describes Project NAMAN as the Indian Army's initiative to provide support to defense personnel through CSCs. This question tests knowledge of specific government initiatives related to veteran welfare.


**10.  The  committee set up at the workplace under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013,  that includes at least half women members, a presiding officer who is a senior woman employee, and an external member from an NGO or similar organization is:**

(a) Local Complaints Committee (LCC)
(b) Juvenile Justice Board (JJB)
(c) Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)
(d)  Primary Medical Board (PMB)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description clearly matches the composition and functions of the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) as defined by the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013.  This question tests the understanding of legal frameworks for addressing workplace harassment.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.


**1.  A global initiative launched in Davos 2024, endorsed by the World Economic Forum and India, aims to share best practices and investments in women's health, education, and enterprise.  What is the name of this initiative?**

(a)  Global Partnership for Women's Empowerment
(b)  Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality
(c)  International Women's Development Consortium
(d)  Global Fund for Women


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question directly refers to the "Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality," highlighting its launch location, key endorsements, and objectives. Option (a) is a plausible distractor, but it lacks the specific details mentioned in the text. Options (c) and (d) are established organizations focusing on women's issues but don't match the description provided. The explanation emphasizes the initiative's origin, its connection to the G20, and the involvement of significant organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).  This demonstrates a grasp of the initiative's broader context and significance within global development discourse.


**2.  Which Act, repealed in 1949, led to the denotification of certain communities previously labeled as "born criminals" during British rule?**

(a)  The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
(b)  The Habitual Offenders Act
(c)  The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955
(d)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The question directly targets the historical context of Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and their origin under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871.  The other options are related to criminal justice and social protection but do not address the specific historical context of the DNTs' denotification. The explanation delves into the implications of the repeal, highlighting the subsequent inclusion of some DNTs in other social categories (ST, SC, OBC), demonstrating an understanding of the complex social dynamics involved.  The mention of the Renke Commission (2008) adds depth, showcasing awareness of contemporary research on the subject.


**3. The  "Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan" (Accessible India Campaign), launched in 2015, falls under which broad area of government policy?**

(a)  Environmental Protection
(b)  Rural Development
(c)  Welfare of Persons with Disabilities
(d)  Skill Development


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the specific policy objective of the Accessible India Campaign. Options (a), (b), and (d) represent distinct policy areas.  While accessibility may indirectly relate to these areas, the primary focus of the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan is the welfare of persons with disabilities. The explanation would highlight the campaign's goals of enhancing accessibility for PwDs, linking it to the broader policy framework for disability rights in India, including relevant acts and policies.  This demonstrates an understanding of the inter-linkages between different policy initiatives.


**4.  Which international convention, adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of human rights by all persons with disabilities?**

(a)  The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)
(b)  The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)
(c)  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)
(d)  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question directly asks about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), specifying its adoption and entry into force dates.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are significant international human rights instruments but do not specifically address the rights of persons with disabilities. The explanation would elaborate on the CRPD's significance in international disability rights law, highlighting its objectives and the implications for signatory states like India.  This highlights the conceptual understanding of international human rights law and its application to specific vulnerable groups.

(a)  The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
(b)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(c)  The Habitual Offenders Act
(d)  The Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly points to the Idate Commission's recommendation and its connection to the Habitual Offenders Act. The other options are laws related to social justice and protection but do not directly address the Idate Commission's specific concern regarding the harassment of DNTs. The explanation would elaborate on the nature of the Habitual Offenders Act, its historical context, and the reasons why the Idate Commission deemed its repeal necessary. This demonstrates an understanding of the legal and social issues affecting marginalized communities in India.

(c) Article 21 (Right to life and personal liberty)
(d) Article 38 (State to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the specific constitutional provision related to cooperative societies and the 97th Amendment. The other options are related to fundamental rights but do not pertain directly to the right to form cooperative societies.

These questions are designed to challenge candidates by demanding specific factual recall, analysis of interconnected concepts, and an understanding of the broader context within which these topics are situated.  The explanations provide ample detail to justify the correct answers and address potential misconceptions.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on child labor, child marriage, disability rights, and other related socio-legal issues in India.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  Consider the following statement regarding the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016:  The Act completely prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all occupations. Which of the following best describes the accuracy of this statement?**

(a) The statement is entirely accurate.
(b) The statement is partially accurate; exceptions exist for certain types of work.
(c) The statement is inaccurate; the Act only prohibits hazardous occupations.
(d) The statement is irrelevant; the Act deals with adolescent labor, not child labor.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The statement is partially true but not entirely accurate.  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, aims to prohibit the employment of children below 14 years in *all* occupations. However, it includes exceptions.  These exceptions allow for children to help in family enterprises under specific conditions and permit work in areas like the arts (audio-visual entertainment) and sports (excluding circuses).  Option (a) is incorrect because of these exceptions. Option (c) is incorrect as the Act prohibits children under 14 from working in any occupation, not just hazardous ones. Option (d) is wrong because the Act explicitly addresses child labor, focusing on those below 14 years. The crucial understanding here is the nuances within the legislation, highlighting that complete prohibition doesn't always translate to a blanket ban in practice.


**2. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCMA) faces challenges in its implementation due to:**

(a) Lack of awareness among the general public about its provisions.
(b) The inadequacy of reporting mechanisms for child marriages.
(c) The overreliance on existing legal frameworks rather than creating specialized mechanisms.
(d) The influence of personal laws and traditions contradicting the Act's objectives.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court's ruling in *Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action v. UoI* highlighted a key challenge to the PCMA: the conflict between the Act and deeply ingrained personal laws and traditions. These traditional practices often override the legal provisions of the PCMA, hindering its effectiveness.  While options (a), (b), and (c) represent valid concerns regarding the implementation of any law, option (d) directly addresses the core issue highlighted by the Supreme Court's judgment.  The case explicitly stated that the PCMA cannot be undermined by personal laws and traditions, emphasizing the need for its supremacy in addressing child marriage.


**3.  Which of the following is NOT a key provision of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006?**

(a) Defining a child's age for marriage purposes.
(b) Establishing a system for nullifying child marriages.
(c) Prescribing punishments for those who abet or solemnize child marriages.
(d) Mandating the establishment of specialized courts for child marriage cases exclusively.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The PCMA does define the age of a child for marriage, provides mechanisms for nullifying child marriages, and details punishments for those involved in such unions. However, the Act does not mandate the establishment of *exclusive* specialized courts for child marriage cases. While the guidelines suggest exploring the possibility of fast-track courts, it's not a mandatory provision within the Act itself.  The other options are all core components of the PCMA's framework. The distinction between suggesting a measure and mandating it is crucial for understanding the Act's scope and limitations.



**4. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) primarily aims to:**

(a) Provide financial assistance to persons with disabilities.
(b) Ensure the full and equal enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities.
(c) Promote the creation of specialized institutions for persons with disabilities.
(d) Focus solely on the physical rehabilitation of persons with disabilities.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UN-CRPD's core objective is to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities. This includes social, economic, political, and civil rights. Options (a), (c), and (d) represent only partial aspects of disability rights; the convention encompasses a much broader and more holistic approach to inclusion and equality.  The emphasis on "full and equal enjoyment" underlines the comprehensive nature of the convention's mandate.


**5. The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) focuses on:**

(a) Providing exclusive financial assistance to tribal communities.
(b) Implementing solely skill-development programs for tribal communities.
(c) Improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities through convergent approaches.
(d) Addressing only the health-related issues of tribal communities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** PM-JUGA aims to comprehensively address the socio-economic needs of tribal communities. It uses a convergence approach, combining various existing schemes to improve infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood opportunities. The scheme is not limited to financial assistance, skill development, or health concerns alone but seeks a holistic improvement in the quality of life for tribal populations.  Understanding the "convergence" aspect is key to differentiating this initiative from other, more narrowly focused programs.


**6.  The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, as amended in 2017, provides for:**

(a)  A decrease in the duration of paid maternity leave for women.
(b)  Paid maternity leave only for women employed in the organized sector.
(c) An increase in paid maternity leave and provisions for work from home for nursing mothers.
(d)  Exclusion of contractual employees from maternity benefits.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 2017 amendment significantly increased the duration of paid maternity leave and introduced provisions for work from home for nursing mothers.  The Madras High Court ruling further clarified that contractual employees are also entitled to these benefits, contradicting option (d). Option (a) is incorrect as the leave duration was increased, not decreased. Option (b) is also incorrect because the Act aims to provide maternity benefits regardless of employment sector (though enforcement may vary).  The key takeaway is the expansion of both the duration of leave and the flexibility offered to working mothers.


**7.  Which of the following statements about Child Care Leave (CCL) is correct based on the provided text?**

(a) CCL is available only to female government employees.
(b) There is a strict age limit for children covered under CCL.
(c) CCL is available to single male parents under certain conditions.
(d)  Himachal Pradesh has fully adopted the central government's provisions on CCL.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The provided text explicitly states that CCL is available to single male parents (unmarried, widowed, or divorced) in addition to female employees.  The text also notes that there's no age limit for disabled children. Himachal Pradesh, however, has not adopted all the central government's provisions. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.  The crucial point is the inclusion of single male parents, highlighting the evolving understanding of parental responsibilities and work-life balance.


**8.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, as amended in 2021, allows for abortion beyond 24 weeks under which specific condition?**

(a)  For unmarried women only.
(b)  In cases of rape, regardless of gestational age.
(c)  For any reason, upon the request of the pregnant woman.
(d)  On grounds of substantial fetal abnormalities.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The 2021 amendment allows for abortion beyond 24 weeks only in cases of substantial fetal abnormalities, requiring the advice of a Medical Board.  While the Supreme Court has expanded access to abortion in certain circumstances, the legal framework under the MTP Act still maintains restrictions based on gestational age and medical indications.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are not the sole criteria for abortion beyond 24 weeks as per the amended Act.  The emphasis on "substantial fetal abnormalities" highlights the continuing ethical and legal considerations surrounding late-term abortions.

(b)  A majority of the committee members must be from the legal profession, ensuring expertise in legal matters.
(c) At least half the members of the committee must be women.
(d) The Presiding Officer must be a male employee of the organization holding a senior management position.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs).  A critical component of the ICC's structure is that at least half its members must be women. This ensures a gender-balanced perspective and fosters a more supportive and unbiased environment for complainants. Option (a) is incorrect as there is no requirement for trade union representation. Option (b) is incorrect; legal expertise is not a mandatory criterion, though desirable. Option (d) is incorrect; the Presiding Officer must be a woman holding a senior position.  The focus on women's representation reflects the Act's goal to address gender-based discrimination and harassment effectively.


**2. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, draws its legal authority from a specific provision of the Indian Constitution.  What is the constitutional basis for this Act?**

(a) Article 21, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.
(b) Article 38, which directs the State to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people.
(c) Article 15(3), which empowers the State to make special provisions for women and children.
(d) Article 44, which directs the State to secure a Uniform Civil Code for the citizens.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, is explicitly enacted under Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution. This article specifically empowers the State to make special provisions for women and children. While Article 21 (right to life) and Article 38 (social order) are relevant to the Act's objectives, they are not the specific constitutional basis for its enactment.  Article 44, aiming for a Uniform Civil Code, is unrelated to the Act's focus on domestic violence.  The choice of Article 15(3) highlights the constitutional recognition of the need for specific legal protections for women against domestic abuse.


**3.  Recent amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, address shortcomings exposed by recent global health crises. Which of the following is a key feature of these amendments?**

(a) The creation of a global fund managed by the World Bank to provide financial assistance to all countries facing epidemics.
(b) The establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism to assist developing countries in responding to public health emergencies.
(c) The elimination of the World Health Organization's role in coordinating international responses to pandemics.
(d)  The requirement that all countries must implement identical public health policies to ensure consistency.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the IHR, 2005, directly address the disparities in resources and capabilities between developed and developing nations during health emergencies.  A key amendment is the establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism to specifically support developing countries in preparedness and response. Option (a) is incorrect; the fund is not managed by the World Bank. Option (c) is incorrect; the WHO's role remains central. Option (d) is incorrect; the amendments encourage coordination but don't mandate identical policies. The focus on financial assistance for developing countries reflects a crucial shift towards equitable global health security.


**4. The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Which of the following accurately describes a key feature of this initiative?**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA is designed as a convergence model, utilizing existing schemes and grants like the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) to address various developmental needs simultaneously.  It doesn't rely on entirely new funding but strategically integrates resources from various sources. Option (a) is incorrect as it uses existing funds. Option (b) is incorrect; it addresses both infrastructure and skill development. Option (c) is incorrect; multiple ministries are involved. The convergence approach reflects a more efficient and comprehensive strategy for tribal development.

(c) The convention promotes the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.
(d) It specifically excludes individuals with intellectual disabilities from its scope of protection.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) explicitly aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities.  This includes social, economic, and political rights. Option (a) is incorrect; the convention sets a framework, not specific programs. Option (b) is incorrect; it addresses a broad range of rights. Option (d) is incorrect; it includes all types of disabilities. The convention's broad scope underscores its commitment to inclusive and equitable participation of persons with disabilities in all aspects of society.

(a) Open Universities
(b) Central Public Universities
(c) State Public Universities
(d) Skill Universities

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NIRF 2024 rankings expanded to include Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities. The addition of these categories reflects a broader inclusion of diverse educational institutions within the Indian higher education landscape.  The absence of "Central Public Universities" as a newly added category is significant because central universities were already included in previous NIRF rankings.  Focusing on the "new" additions tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the changes introduced in the 2024 edition, highlighting the importance of detailed understanding of specific policy updates.


**3.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India. Which of the following is NOT a core objective of this scheme?**

(a) Saturation of critical gaps in social infrastructure.
(b) Improvement of health and education facilities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately reflects the described initiative's primary goal—developing infrastructure—and correctly links it to the relevant national schemes. PM Gram Sadak Yojana focuses on road connectivity, Jal Jeevan Mission on water supply, and PM Jan Arogya Yojana on healthcare coverage, all crucial components of enabling infrastructure for tribal communities.  Options (a), (b), and (d) focus on different goals and associated schemes that are not the primary focus of the described initiative.  Option (a) is partially correct in mentioning PM Awas Yojana (Gramin) but misses the crucial elements of water and healthcare access. Option (b) focuses on livelihood enhancement, a secondary goal within the broader infrastructure development plan. Option (d) correctly mentions Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan but does not align with the primary infrastructure focus.


**2.  A program aims to empower rural women by providing agricultural extension services and transforming rural India.  Identify the program and the key training aspect involved.**

(a) PM-JUGA; Training in sustainable tourism practices.
(b) Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM); Training in microfinance management.
(c) Krishi Sakhi convergence program (KSCP);  56-day training on various agricultural extension services.
(d) National Rural Livelihoods Mission; Training in traditional craft production.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Krishi Sakhi convergence program (KSCP) explicitly focuses on empowering rural women through agricultural extension services.  The 56-day training period is a central element of the program. Option (a) is incorrect; while PM-JUGA aims to improve tribal communities' lives, it doesn't directly center on agricultural training for women. Option (b) is partially correct in mentioning DAY-NRLM, but it focuses on broader rural livelihoods and doesn't specify the 56-day agricultural training. Option (d) is too general and doesn't mention the specific program or the training duration.


**3.  A scheme aims to provide financial assistance to eligible rural households for housing construction, with varying amounts depending on geographical location. Which scheme is described, and what are its key financial provisions?**

(a) PMAY-U; ₹1.0 lakh for ISSR, ₹1.5 lakh for AHP and BLC.
(b) PMAY-G; ₹1.20 lakh in plain areas, ₹1.30 lakh in hilly areas, plus ₹12,000 for toilets.
(c)  Deendayal Antodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM); Revolving Fund of ₹2,500 crore.
(d)  National Food Security Act (NFSA); Provision of food grains free of cost to 80 crore poor.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description clearly points to PMAY-G (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin), a rural housing scheme. The specific financial assistance amounts for plain and hilly areas, along with the additional toilet construction allowance, are defining features of PMAY-G. Option (a) describes PMAY-U (Urban), a different scheme. Option (c) refers to a livelihood scheme focusing on revolving funds, and option (d) describes a food security act, neither of which matches the housing-focused description.


**4.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) assesses hunger levels globally and nationally.  Which of the following accurately describes a key finding of the GHI 2024 concerning India?**

(a) India's GHI score improved significantly, placing it in the "low" hunger category.
(b) India ranked among the top 20 countries with the lowest hunger levels.
(c)  India's GHI score showed a decline, but child wasting and stunting remain high.
(d) India's GHI score remained unchanged from the previous year, indicating stagnation in hunger reduction efforts.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text states that India's GHI score improved (from 111th to 105th), but it still falls under the "serious" category and that child wasting and stunting remain significant problems.  Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the key finding regarding India's GHI score and the persistent challenges related to child malnutrition.


**5.  Which of the following statements accurately describes the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)?**

(a) It is a state-sponsored scheme focused solely on improving healthcare access for tribal communities.
(b) It is a centrally sponsored scheme aiming to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods for tribal communities.
(c) It is a private initiative focused on promoting sustainable tourism in tribal areas.
(d) It is a national program solely focused on skill development and entrepreneurship for tribal youth.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA is explicitly described as a centrally sponsored scheme with a broad objective of addressing multiple aspects of tribal community development. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the funding source, scope, or focus of the Abhiyan.  PM-JUGA's multi-faceted approach to addressing social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods is central to its design.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  Each question is designed to be challenging, with plausible distractors.


**1.  A Swiss-based NGO, established in 2002 at the United Nations, focuses on mitigating malnutrition's impact on human lives.  It actively fosters public-private partnerships to enhance access to essential nutrients within diets. Which organization fits this description?**

(a) World Food Programme
(b) Food and Agriculture Organization
(c) Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d) International Food Policy Research Institute


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description precisely matches the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN).  GAIN is explicitly identified as a Swiss-based NGO founded in 2002 at the UN, with a mission to combat malnutrition. Its emphasis on public-private partnerships to improve nutrient access in diets further solidifies its identity. The other options, while involved in food security and nutrition, do not perfectly align with all aspects of the provided description. The World Food Programme (WFP) focuses on food aid and security, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on broader agricultural and food systems, and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on research and policy analysis.  These organizations have significant roles in global nutrition but don't perfectly match the specific details given in the question.


**2.  A report, released annually by five UN specialized agencies, comprehensively analyzes the global state of food security and nutrition.  It addresses financing mechanisms to eradicate hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition in all its forms.  Which report is being described?**

(a) Global Hunger Index
(b) Food Waste Index Report
(c) State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report
(d) Global Report on Food Crises


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question describes the "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report."  The report's annual release, its focus on financing to end hunger and malnutrition, and its publication by five UN agencies (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO) all pinpoint this report. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) assesses hunger levels using different metrics. The Food Waste Index Report focuses specifically on food waste. The Global Report on Food Crises addresses food crises, but not comprehensively the state of global nutrition and food security in the same manner.


**3.  Launched at the 2024 G20 Leaders’ Summit in Brazil, this global alliance aims to accelerate the eradication of hunger and poverty, while simultaneously reducing inequalities.  It operates through a "Policy Basket" and works as a neutral facilitator, mobilizing resources to implement its policy instruments. Which initiative is this?**

(a) Global Network Against Food Crises
(b) Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality
(c) Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty
(d) Zero Hunger Challenge


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description clearly points to the "Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty." The details of its launch at the G20 Summit in Brazil, its tripartite approach (National, Financial, and Knowledge pillars), and its role as a neutral facilitator in mobilizing resources for SDG implementation directly align with this initiative. The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) tackles food crises. The Alliance for Global Good focuses on gender equity. The Zero Hunger Challenge is a broader UN initiative.


**4.  Which organization, established in 1961 as a branch of the United Nations, provides food aid, promotes food security, and works to improve nutrition globally to combat hunger?**

(a) UNICEF
(b) UNFPA
(c) World Food Programme (WFP)
(d) FAO


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The World Food Programme (WFP) precisely fits this description. Its 1961 founding as a UN branch, its focus on food aid, food security, and nutrition enhancement, and its global reach in combating hunger all align with the question.  UNICEF focuses on children's rights, UNFPA on population issues, and FAO on broader food and agriculture. While the latter two may indirectly contribute to nutrition, they don't have the core mandate of direct food aid delivery.


**5.  The 2024 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report highlights a concerning issue: the unattainability of the "Zero Hunger" goal by 2030 due to alarming hunger levels in numerous countries. Which two NGOs are responsible for publishing this report?**

(a) Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
(b) GAIN and IFPRI
(c) FAO and WFP
(d) UNICEF and WHO


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The question specifically names Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe as the publishers of the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 report.  The other options list organizations involved in food security and nutrition but are not the specific publishers of the GHI report.  The correct answer requires precise recall of the organizations named in the context of the GHI report.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions focus more on factual recall and others on application and conceptual understanding.  The difficulty level varies, with some questions requiring deeper knowledge of the subject matter.


**1.  A global initiative aims to eradicate hunger and poverty, while simultaneously reducing inequalities.  Which of the following correctly identifies this initiative and its core principles?**

(a) The Rome Declaration on Nutrition, focusing on combating malnutrition.
(b) The World Food Programme, providing food aid and promoting food security.
(c) The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, operating on national, financial, and knowledge pillars.
(d) The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 2 (Zero Hunger).


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, launched at the G20 Leaders' Summit 2024, directly addresses the prompt's description. Its three-pillar approach (national, financial, and knowledge) signifies a multifaceted strategy to tackle hunger, poverty, and inequality.  While the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and SDG 2 are related to hunger reduction, they don't encompass the broader aim of poverty reduction and inequality addressed by the Global Alliance. The World Food Programme, although crucial in combating hunger, is a single organization rather than a comprehensive alliance with multiple actors.


**2.  The Union Government's initiative to establish campuses of foreign universities in India is guided by which regulatory framework and policy document?**

(a) The National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, prioritizing research collaboration.
(b) The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023,  in line with the National Education Policy 2020.
(c) The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), aiming to improve the quality of Indian universities.
(d) The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) Act, 2023, focused on fostering research culture.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, explicitly addresses the establishment of foreign university campuses in India.  The National Education Policy 2020 envisages this internationalization of higher education, making (b) the most accurate answer. While NRF, NIRF, and ANRF are relevant to higher education in India, they do not directly govern the entry of foreign universities.


**3.  Which of the following accurately describes the "Asmita Project" launched by the Union Ministry of Education?**

(a) A program to improve the quality of education in government schools.
(b) An initiative to promote multilingualism in education by producing study materials in various Indian languages.
(c) A project focused on digital literacy and access to technology in education.
(d) A scheme to enhance teacher training and development across India.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Asmita Project's core objective is to provide high-quality study materials in various scheduled languages.  This directly promotes multilingualism in education, aligning with the New Education Policy 2020's emphasis on mother-tongue instruction. The other options, while related to education, do not accurately reflect the specific goals of the Asmita Project.


**4.  The recently concluded 77th annual World Health Assembly made significant amendments to which international health framework?**

(a) The Rome Declaration on Nutrition, strengthening global nutrition strategies.
(b) The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), improving disability inclusion.
(c) The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, enhancing global pandemic preparedness.
(d) The Biwako Millennium Framework, promoting an inclusive society.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 77th World Health Assembly focused on amending the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005.  The amendments address shortcomings highlighted by recent epidemics and pandemics, improving global preparedness and response mechanisms. The other options are unrelated to the specific actions of the World Health Assembly described.


**5.  Which organization is responsible for releasing the "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World" report?**

(a) The World Bank, providing global economic and development data.
(b) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), focusing on sustainable development.
(c) A collaboration of five UN specialized agencies, including FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO.
(d) The International Monetary Fund (IMF), analyzing global financial stability.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The report is a collaborative effort of five UN agencies: FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO.  This collaborative approach reflects the multifaceted nature of food security and nutrition, requiring expertise from various sectors. The other organizations, while relevant to global issues, do not produce this specific report.


**6.  Which of the following initiatives aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India, taking inspiration from the Ulgulan movement?**

(a) The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013.
(b) The POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission).
(c) Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), named after Birsa Munda.
(d) The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA explicitly focuses on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities and is named after Birsa Munda, a leader of the Ulgulan movement.  While the other options address related issues, they do not have the same direct focus on tribal development inspired by historical tribal resistance.


**7.  Which of the following accurately describes the "Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)" in higher education?**

(a) A system for assessing the quality of teaching in higher education institutions.
(b) A mechanism to evaluate a person's existing knowledge and skills gained through various learning pathways.
(c) A program to promote research and innovation in higher education.
(d) A framework for international collaboration in higher education.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

RPL's core function is to formally evaluate knowledge and skills acquired through formal, non-formal, or informal learning.  This bridges the gap between various learning pathways and formal education.  The other options describe different aspects of higher education but do not accurately reflect RPL's purpose.


**8.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) uses how many parameters to rank educational institutions in India?**

(a) Three parameters focusing on teaching, research, and student outcomes.
(b) Seven parameters covering various aspects of institutional performance.
(c) Five parameters including Teaching, Learning, Research, Graduation Outcomes, and Outreach.
(d) Nine parameters based on global ranking methodologies.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

NIRF employs five key parameters to rank institutions: Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.  While the number of parameters might expand over time, the initial core set remains as described in (c).


**9.  Which of the following is NOT a key feature of the draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024?**

(a) A focus on achieving global excellence in sports.
(b) The integration of sports with the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020.
(c) Emphasizing sports solely as a means of individual achievement.
(d) Promoting sports for social development and inclusivity.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NSP, 2024 emphasizes a holistic approach to sports, integrating it with national development and social inclusion.  It moves beyond individual achievement to encompass broader societal goals.  Option (c) misrepresents the policy's broader vision.


**10.  The Indian Army's Project NAMAN utilizes which existing infrastructure to provide services to defense pensioners and veterans?**

(a)  AIIMS hospitals and premier institutes.
(b)  SPARSH-centric Common Service Centres (CSCs).
(c)  Mobile Medical Units under the National Health Mission.
(d)  Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs).


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project NAMAN leverages SPARSH-centric CSCs to deliver services to defense pensioners and veterans. This utilizes existing infrastructure for efficient service delivery.  The other options are unrelated to Project NAMAN's infrastructure and service delivery model.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  The questions are designed to be challenging, with plausible distractors, and avoid simple recall.


**1.  A government initiative aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence and outreach.  This initiative is based on learnings from a previous program focused on tribal justice. Which program is this initiative based on?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)
(c)  Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN)
(d)  National Food Security Act (NFSA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly refers to the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), which explicitly states its foundation on the learnings and success of PM-JANMAN.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are unrelated programs focusing on rural roads, financial inclusion, and food security respectively.  They are plausible distractors as they are government schemes related to rural development, but they do not relate directly to the stated initiative's basis.  Understanding the linkage between PM-JUGA and PM-JANMAN demonstrates a deeper understanding of government policy and its evolution.


**2. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006 grants specific rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). Which of the following rights, as defined by the FRA, is specifically granted to PVTGs?**

(a)  Rights to free education up to the secondary level.
(b)  Rights to participate in the management of forest resources.
(c)  Rights to access government-sponsored healthcare facilities.
(d)  Rights to their customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the FRA grants habitat rights to PVTGs under Section 3(1)(e).  This right encompasses customary habitats and other habitats within reserved and protected forests. While options (a), (b), and (c) are related to the well-being of PVTGs, they are not specifically defined as rights under the FRA's definition of habitat rights.  The correct answer requires precise understanding of the legal definition within the FRA, showcasing a grasp of legal frameworks related to tribal rights.


**3.  A report tracks global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels, supporting two indicators of SDG 12.3. Which organization is the custodian of the Food Waste Index (FWI), one of the indicators mentioned?**

(a)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(b)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(c)  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(d)  World Health Organization (WHO)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that UNEP is the custodian of the FWI.  The FAO is mentioned in relation to another SDG 12.3 indicator, but not the FWI. WFP and WHO are involved in other aspects of food security and health, but are not connected to the FWI custodianship.  This question tests the ability to differentiate between multiple international organizations involved in related but distinct areas of sustainable development goals.  Selecting the correct answer requires precise attention to detail within the provided text.


**4.  A national framework released by the Ministry of Women and Child Development aims to empower caregivers and Anganwadi Workers to stimulate holistic early development in children from birth to three years.  Which framework is this?**

(a)  National ECCE Policy, 2013
(b)  National Curriculum Framework for Foundational Stage (NCF-FS) 2022
(c)  Navchetana - National Framework for Early Childhood Stimulation (ECS)
(d)  Nurturing care framework for Early Childhood Development (WHO, 2018)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description directly points to the Navchetana framework. While the other options are related to early childhood care and education, they don't match the specific focus and age group described. The WHO framework is mentioned as a broader context, but Navchetana is the specific national framework being discussed.  This tests the ability to identify a specific policy instrument within a broader context of related policies and frameworks.


**5.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, released by two NGOs, highlighted alarming hunger levels in numerous countries, impacting the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030. Which two NGOs released this report?**

(a)  Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
(b)  FAO and WFP
(c)  GAIN and UNEP
(d)  WHO and UNICEF

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly names Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe as the releasing organizations of the GHI 2024. Options (b), (c), and (d) list other relevant organizations involved in food security and nutrition, but they are not the ones responsible for the GHI report. This question assesses factual recall of specific organizations and their publications.  The ability to recall the names of these NGOs demonstrates a higher level of knowledge in global development issues.


**6.  A Supreme Court case highlighted caste-based discrimination in prisons, focusing on issues such as segregation of barracks and division of manual labor.  This case specifically addressed discrimination against which groups of people?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs)
(b)  Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and “habitual offenders”
(c)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and minorities
(d)  Prisoners with mental health issues and those with physical disabilities

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions the Supreme Court case addressing discrimination against DNTs and "habitual offenders" within prison walls. While other groups might face discrimination, this specific case focused on these two categories. This question demands a precise understanding of the case's subject matter, testing the ability to recall specific vulnerable groups targeted by the court ruling.


**7.  An initiative aims to simplify the licensing and registration processes for food businesses through a pan-India IT platform.  What is the name of this platform?**

(a)  Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM)
(b)  Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL)
(c)  Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS)
(d)  Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions the FoSCoS platform in relation to the instant issuance of food licenses and registrations.  The other options are related to healthcare initiatives and standards, not food licensing.  This question tests the ability to identify the specific IT platform used for a particular government initiative.


**8.  Which of the following best describes the Lakhpati Didi initiative?**

(a)  A program providing free healthcare to women in rural areas.
(b)  An initiative to empower women through skill development and entrepreneurship.
(c)  A scheme providing financial assistance to women-led self-help groups (SHGs).
(d)  A program focused on improving access to education for girls in rural India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The passage explicitly describes the Lakhpati Didi initiative as aiming to enable women SHG members to earn an annual household income of Rs. 1 Lakh or more, and it details the financial assistance provided. While (b) is partially true, (c) is the most comprehensive and accurate description, highlighting the central focus on financial empowerment through SHGs. Options (a) and (d) are unrelated to the initiative's core objective.  This tests the ability to synthesize information from the passage to identify the most accurate and encompassing description of a specific program.


**9.  The “joint development and commercialisation” of a low dose or paediatric oral formulation of a certain drug to treat sickle cell disease in India is being pursued. Which drug is this?**

(a)  Donanemab
(b)  Hydroxyurea
(c)  Ozempic
(d)  Mifepristone

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly mentions the ICMR's invitation for the development of a hydroxyurea formulation for sickle cell disease.  The other drugs are mentioned elsewhere in the text but are unrelated to this specific initiative. This demonstrates knowledge of specific drugs used in treating particular diseases and their relevance to Indian healthcare policy.


**10.  A particular treaty aims to prevent states from placing weapons into orbit or installing them on celestial bodies. Which treaty is this?**

(a)  The 1967 Outer Space Treaty
(b)  The Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) Treaty
(c)  The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)
(d)  The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage describes the PAROS Treaty's aim to prevent the placement of weapons in space. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty is related to space activities, it doesn't have the specific focus on preventing weaponization as the PAROS Treaty does.  Options (c) and (d) are nuclear-related treaties, not directly focused on space weapons.  This question tests knowledge of specific international treaties related to space and arms control.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (a collection of news snippets and policy summaries), some questions may focus more on factual recall than higher-order cognitive skills.  However, I have attempted to create challenging questions with plausible distractors where possible.


**1.  A government initiative aims to improve the socioeconomic conditions of tribal communities in India, drawing inspiration from a past movement of resistance against British rule.  Which of the following accurately describes this initiative and its namesake?**

(a)  The Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN), named after Rani Lakshmibai.
(b)  The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), named after Birsa Munda.
(c)  The Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana, named after Tantia Tope.
(d)  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, named after Mangal Pandey.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the passage explicitly states that the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known for his resistance against British rule.  Option (a) is incorrect because PM-JANMAN is a separate initiative, and Rani Lakshmibai was not directly associated with a nationwide tribal resistance movement. Option (c) is incorrect as the Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana is not named after Tantia Tope, and option (d) is incorrect as the Forest Rights Act is not named after any individual mentioned.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to link a policy initiative to its historical context.


**2.  Recent amendments to international health regulations highlight the need for improved global health preparedness.  Which of the following accurately reflects a key amendment and its rationale?**

(a)  The definition of a pandemic now excludes events with limited geographical spread.
(b)  A new financial mechanism prioritizes developed nations' needs.
(c)  The amendments abolish the World Health Assembly's role in global health governance.
(d)  The creation of a States Parties Committee aims to improve coordination and implementation.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) correctly identifies a key amendment—the establishment of a States Parties Committee to enhance the implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR).  The rationale is the need for improved coordination among countries, a lesson learned from recent global health crises. Option (a) is incorrect as the definition of a pandemic specifically includes wide geographical spread or a high risk thereof. Option (b) is incorrect because the amendment aims to address the needs of *developing* countries. Option (c) is incorrect as the World Health Assembly remains the decision-making body of the WHO. The question assesses understanding of global health policy and the rationale behind specific policy changes.


**3.  The Indian government has taken steps to address the issue of domestic violence.  Which of the following legal instruments specifically addresses civil remedies for marital rape, without criminal prosecution?**

(a)  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.
(b)  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.
(c)  The Indian Penal Code, 1860.
(d)  The Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, specifically addresses civil remedies for domestic violence, including marital rape, without initiating criminal proceedings.  The Act provides for protection orders, monetary compensation, and other civil remedies. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they primarily deal with criminal aspects of violence or broader legal procedures.  The question tests knowledge of specific legislation and its limitations concerning domestic violence.


**4.  India's healthcare landscape is undergoing changes.  Which of the following accurately reflects a recent trend in healthcare financing in India, according to the provided data?**

(a)  Government health expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of total health expenditure (THE) has decreased.
(b)  Out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) on healthcare has increased as a percentage of THE.
(c)  Private health insurance expenditure (PHIE) has decreased as a percentage of THE.
(d)  Social security expenditure (SSE) on health has increased as a percentage of THE.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage indicates that Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of Total Health Expenditure (THE) has *increased*, not decreased,  reflecting a growing role of government funding.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are all incorrect because the passage shows that OOPE has decreased, PHIE has increased, and SSE has decreased as percentages of THE. This question tests the ability to interpret and analyze numerical data related to healthcare financing.


**5.  A recent Supreme Court ruling allowed a specific medical procedure beyond the usual gestational limit.  Which of the following best describes this ruling and its context?**

(a)  The court permitted a sex-selective abortion beyond 24 weeks.
(b)  The court permitted an abortion for a 14-year-old rape survivor beyond 24 weeks.
(c)  The court legalized abortion for all pregnancies beyond 24 weeks.
(d)  The court restricted abortion access for minors.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that the Supreme Court used its special powers to permit an abortion for a 14-year-old rape survivor beyond the 24-week gestational limit usually allowed under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the specifics of the ruling.  The question tests factual recall of a specific legal decision and its circumstances.


**6.  A global organization works to combat doping in sports.  Which of the following correctly identifies this organization and one of its key initiatives?**

(a)  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its "Play True" campaign.
(b)  The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and its "Play True" campaign.
(c)  The UNESCO and its "Clean Sport" initiative.
(d)  The South Asia Regional Anti-Doping Organization (SARADO) and its "Athlete First" program.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) conducts the "#PlayTrue" campaign. The IOC is involved in anti-doping but is not the primary organization conducting this campaign. UNESCO has a convention against doping, but "Play True" is specifically associated with WADA. SARADO is a regional organization, not the global body mentioned. This question tests knowledge of international sports organizations and their activities.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.


**1.  A global initiative aiming to eradicate hunger and poverty while simultaneously reducing inequalities, launched at a G20 summit and involving numerous countries and international organizations, is best described as:**

(a) The Rome Declaration on Nutrition
(b) The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
(c) The World Food Programme (WFP)
(d) The Zero Hunger Challenge


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) directly addresses the eradication of hunger and poverty while aiming to reduce inequalities.  It's a multi-stakeholder initiative, involving governments, international organizations, and NGOs, launched at a G20 summit. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition focuses specifically on nutrition, while the WFP is a UN agency providing food aid. The Zero Hunger Challenge is a broader UN initiative, not a specific, coordinated alliance like GNAFC. The GNAFC's structure, goals, and launch context make it the most fitting answer.  Its 'Policy Basket' approach to mobilizing resources and building partnerships showcases its comprehensive strategy for tackling these interconnected issues, exceeding the scope of the other options.  The other options, while relevant to food security and poverty reduction, lack the specific multi-national collaborative framework and the simultaneous focus on inequality reduction that defines the GNAFC.


**2.  The 2022 testing figures from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed that a particular nation had the highest percentage of doping offenders. This nation is:**

(a) China
(b) Russia
(c) India
(d) United States


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly states that India recorded the highest percentage (3.26%) of doping offenders according to WADA's 2022 testing figures.  This is a specific factual detail directly from the source.  While other countries have also faced issues with doping in sports, the question explicitly asks for the nation with the *highest* percentage in 2022, which, according to the data, is India.  The other options are plausible distractors, as they are all nations known to participate in international sporting events and have faced doping scandals in the past; however, none of them match the specific data provided regarding the highest percentage of offenders in 2022. The inclusion of this detail makes the question challenging and requires precise recall of the information presented.


**3.  Which initiative, launched by the Indian Army, aims to provide dedicated support and services to defense pensioners, veterans, and their families through Common Service Centres (CSCs)?**

(a)  SPARSH
(b)  PM-JUGA
(c)  Project NAMAN
(d)  ASMITA


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Project NAMAN is explicitly described in the provided text as an Indian Army initiative designed to support defense pensioners, veterans, and their families via SPARSH-centric CSCs.  SPARSH itself is a system, not an initiative. PM-JUGA focuses on improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, and ASMITA promotes multilingualism in education.  These other initiatives are unrelated to the specific support services for defense personnel and their families, making them incorrect options.  The precise detail regarding the use of CSCs further strengthens the accuracy and specificity of the correct answer, highlighting the targeted nature of Project NAMAN.


**4.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, has how many signatories, including India?**

(a) 154
(b) 174
(c) 164
(d) 184


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The text explicitly states that the UN-CRPD has 164 signatories, including India. This is a direct factual recall question.  The other options are plausible distractors but are not supported by the given information.  The precision of the number (164) makes it a challenging question, requiring precise factual recall. The inclusion of "including India" adds a layer of complexity, preventing simple elimination based on common knowledge of UN membership.  The question tests factual knowledge about a specific international treaty and its ratification status, a key area of concern for UPSC examinations.


**5.  An organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland (with an office in India), launched at the United Nations in 2002 to address malnutrition, and supporting public-private partnerships to improve dietary nutrient access, is identified as:**

(a) UNICEF
(b)  FAO
(c) GAIN
(d)  WFP


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description perfectly matches the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN).  The other options are UN agencies focused on broader aspects of food security, child welfare, or agricultural development, but they do not precisely fit the description of a Swiss-based NGO focused on improving nutrient access through public-private partnerships. The question's detailed description, including location, founding year, and operational strategy, makes it more challenging and demands a specific understanding of the organization's mandate and structure.  It also tests the ability to recall lesser-known but significant organizations in the field of global health and nutrition.


**6. The amendment to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, following the experiences of the Ebola and COVID-19 pandemics, introduced which of the following crucial mechanisms?**

(a) A system for direct financial aid to affected individuals.
(b) A coordinating financial mechanism for developing countries.
(c) A global health task force led by the WHO Director-General.
(d) Mandatory lockdowns for all countries during pandemics.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly mentions the establishment of a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to specifically address the needs of developing countries in the context of public health emergencies.  The other options, while potentially desirable or previously considered, are not specifically mentioned as part of the IHR amendments following the Ebola and COVID-19 outbreaks. This question tests the candidate's understanding of international health governance and the evolution of global health responses to pandemics, a crucial area for UPSC preparation.  The focus on developing countries adds a layer of complexity, requiring a precise understanding of the amendment’s intended impact.


**7.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), launched by the Prime Minister of India, is named after which tribal leader known for resisting British rule?**

(a) Mangal Pandey
(b) Rani Lakshmibai
(c) Birsa Munda
(d)  Subhas Chandra Bose


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that PM-JUGA is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known for his resistance against British rule and his leadership of the Ulgulan movement.  The other options are prominent figures in Indian history but are not associated with the naming of this specific scheme.  This question tests knowledge of Indian history and the linkage between government schemes and historical figures, a common theme in UPSC examinations. The focus on a specific historical figure associated with a contemporary government program requires precise knowledge and analytical skills.


**8.  Which of the following is a cell-based gene therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of Sickle Cell Disease?**

(a) Exa-cel
(b) Lyfgenia
(c) Both Exa-cel and Lyfgenia
(d) Neither Exa-cel nor Lyfgenia


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text mentions Lyfgenia as an FDA-approved cell-based gene therapy for Sickle Cell Disease.  Exa-cel is mentioned as a CRISPR-based therapy, which is a different type of gene therapy. This question tests knowledge of recent advancements in medical technology and their regulatory approvals, a common theme in UPSC examinations focused on science and technology.  The subtle distinction between different types of gene therapies makes this a challenging question, demanding precise understanding of the medical terminology and the specific details provided in the text.

(a) Establishing new schools in rural areas.
(b) Providing scholarships to underprivileged students.
(c) Promoting multilingualism in education.
(d) Improving teacher training programs.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Asmita Project aims to promote multilingualism in education by providing high-quality study materials in various Indian languages.  The other options are relevant to education but do not reflect the specific purpose of the Asmita Project. This question tests knowledge of current educational policies and initiatives in India, a crucial area for UPSC examinations.  The focus on a specific project and its objectives makes it a challenging question, requiring precise recall and understanding of the government's educational agenda.


**10.  According to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, India's ranking among 127 countries falls into which category of hunger severity?**

(a) Low
(b) Moderate
(c) Serious
(d) Alarming


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The text states that India's ranking places it in the "serious" category of hunger severity according to the GHI 2024.  While the global GHI score is moderate, India's specific score and ranking place it in the "serious" category. This question tests understanding of global and national indices related to food security and nutrition, a crucial area for UPSC examinations. The distinction between the global and national hunger levels adds a layer of complexity, preventing simple answers based on general knowledge.  The question requires precise recall of information from the provided text.


**1.  A global report focusing on financial strategies to combat hunger and malnutrition was recently published. Which organization is primarily responsible for its creation?**

(a)  The World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) in collaboration with the Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
(c)  The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(d)  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), under the aegis of the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC).  The GNAFC, a collaborative effort launched in 2016 by the European Union, the FAO, and the WFP, aims to address the root causes of food crises. While the WHO, UNEP, and IFPRI are involved in various aspects of food security and nutrition, the GRFC's primary authorship lies with the GNAFC and FSIN. The question tests factual recall of the organizations involved in producing this specific report.  Option (a) is incorrect as the WHO's focus is broader public health, not specifically this report. Option (c) is incorrect because UNEP focuses on environmental aspects related to food waste, not this specific hunger report. Option (d) is incorrect as IFPRI conducts research on food policy but doesn't directly produce this specific report.


**2. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) directly related to eliminating hunger and achieving food security by 2030 is:**

(a) SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
(b) SDG 1: No Poverty
(c) SDG 2: Zero Hunger
(d) SDG 13: Climate Action

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** SDG 2, Zero Hunger, explicitly targets ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. While the other SDGs are interconnected and contribute to food security (e.g., poverty reduction in SDG 1, improved health in SDG 3, climate mitigation in SDG 13), SDG 2 is the primary and direct focus on eliminating hunger. This question tests conceptual understanding of the SDGs and their specific targets.  Option (a) is related but broader than just food security. Option (b) is a contributing factor but not the specific goal. Option (d) is important for long-term food security but not the main goal.


**3.  Which international index assesses the severity of hunger globally and ranks countries based on their performance in combating hunger?**

(a)  Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)
(b)  Gender Inequality Index (GII)
(c)  Global Hunger Index (GHI)
(d)  Food Waste Index (FWI)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is a multidimensional index that measures and tracks hunger at the global, regional, and national levels. It considers indicators like undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality.  The other indices measure different aspects: GGGI focuses on gender equality, GII on gender inequality, and FWI on food waste. The question assesses factual recall of the index's purpose and function. Option (a) is incorrect; it focuses on gender parity. Option (b) is incorrect; it focuses on gender-related inequalities. Option (d) is incorrect; it focuses on the amount of food wasted.


**4. A Swiss-based NGO dedicated to combating malnutrition by promoting access to essential nutrients, often through public-private partnerships, is known as:**

(a) UNICEF
(b)  The World Food Programme (WFP)
(c)  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d)  UN Women

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) is a prominent NGO headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, that focuses on improving nutrition globally through collaborative partnerships. The other options are UN agencies with broader mandates, not specifically focused on nutrient access and public-private partnerships in the way GAIN is. The question tests knowledge of specific NGOs and their areas of expertise. Option (a) is incorrect; it is a UN agency focusing on children's welfare. Option (b) is incorrect; it is a UN agency focused on food assistance. Option (d) is incorrect; it focuses on gender equality and women’s rights.


**5. The Indian government scheme that provides free food grains to a large section of its impoverished population is:**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(b)  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(c)  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)
(d)  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) is a flagship program of the Indian government that provides free food grains to a substantial portion of the country's poor population.  While the other options are also related to nutrition and food security in India, they don't focus on direct, free food grain distribution on the scale of PMGKAY.  This question tests factual recall of specific government schemes and their objectives. Option (a) provides financial assistance and nutritional support to mothers. Option (b) focuses on supplementary nutrition. Option (d) is a legal framework, not a specific distribution program.

(c)  FWI
(d)  GII

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Gender Inequality Index (GII) employs a scale of 0 to 1 to quantify gender inequality, encompassing reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity.  The other indices address different aspects: GGGI measures gender gaps, GHI tracks hunger, and FWI assesses food waste. This question assesses understanding of the specific measurement scales used in different indices. Option (a) measures gender gaps. Option (b) measures hunger. Option (c) measures food waste.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.

**1.  A government initiative aims at the comprehensive socio-economic development of specific tribal groups while preserving their cultural heritage.  This initiative provides 100% central funding and utilizes a micro-plan approach involving Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans. Which program best fits this description?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(b)  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme
(c)  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013
(d)  Aadharshila, a National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description perfectly matches the "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme." This centrally sponsored scheme explicitly aims for comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs while safeguarding their culture and heritage.  The 100% central assistance and the use of Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans as a micro-plan approach are key features of this scheme.  Option (a), PM-JUGA, while focused on tribal development, doesn't specifically mention the 100% central funding or the CCD plan approach in the same way. Option (c), the NFSA, addresses food security, not the holistic development of PVTGs. Option (d), Aadharshila, focuses on early childhood education, a different domain altogether.  The other options are related to tribal welfare but miss crucial details mentioned in the question, making them unsuitable.


**2.  Which of the following states has the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) according to government recognition based on the Dhebar Committee's recommendations?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Maharashtra
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, the highest among all states and Union Territories.  While Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra have significant PVTG populations, they do not surpass Odisha's count according to the information provided.  This question tests factual recall of a specific statistic related to PVTG distribution across Indian states.  The other options are plausible distractors because these states also have substantial PVTG populations, but are not the highest.


**3. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006 grants a specific right to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). This right, defined within the FRA, encompasses customary habitats and other habitats within reserved and protected forests. What is this specific right called?**

(a)  Land Ownership Rights
(b)  Livelihood Rights
(c)  Habitat Rights
(d)  Grazing Rights

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly defines "Habitat Rights" as the rights granted to PVTGs under Section 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. This right encompasses their customary habitats and other habitats within reserved and protected forests.  While the FRA also addresses livelihood rights, land ownership is not a primary focus for PVTGs under the FRA.  Grazing rights are a component of broader livelihood rights but not the specific right defined in the passage. The question requires understanding the specific terminology and provisions of the FRA concerning PVTG rights.


**4.  A legal case, *Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others*, challenged discriminatory practices within prisons based on caste. This case led to the overturning of provisions assigning jobs based on caste in several states' prison manuals.  Which marginalized group was particularly affected by these discriminatory practices?**

(a) Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b) Other Backward Castes (OBCs)
(c) Denotified Tribes (DNTs)
(d) Nomadic Tribes (NTs)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The *Sukanya Santha* case specifically highlighted the caste-based discrimination faced by Denotified Tribes (DNTs) within prisons. While other marginalized groups like SCs and OBCs also face discrimination, this particular case focused on the unique vulnerabilities of DNTs and the discriminatory practices targeting them within the prison system.  The ruling directly addressed the unconstitutional nature of these discriminatory practices against DNTs and "habitual offenders".  Although Nomadic Tribes are mentioned, the question directly refers to the specific group highlighted in the *Sukanya Santha* case.


**5.  The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) was established to address the root causes of food crises.  Which three international organizations were instrumental in launching this network in 2016?**

(a) World Bank, IMF, and UN Development Programme
(b)  European Union, FAO, and WFP
(c)  WHO, UNICEF, and UNHCR
(d)  G20, WTO, and OECD

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the GNAFC was launched by the European Union, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Food Programme (WFP) at the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016.  The other options represent important international organizations, but they were not involved in the GNAFC's founding. This question tests factual knowledge about a specific international initiative and its key stakeholders.  The incorrect options are plausible distractors because they are all relevant to global development and humanitarian efforts.


**6.  The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report tracks food waste at specific levels of the supply chain. At which two levels does the FWI primarily focus its data collection?**

(a) Production and Transportation
(b) Processing and Wholesale
(c) Retail and Consumer
(d) Import and Export


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly indicates that the FWI tracks food waste at the retail and consumer (household and food service) levels.  While food waste occurs across the entire supply chain, the FWI's specific focus is on the final stages before consumption.  The other options represent other important stages of the food supply chain where losses can occur, but are not the primary focus of the FWI.


**7.  A national curriculum for early childhood care and education (ECCE), launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, provides a detailed learning plan for a specific age group. This curriculum, named after a term meaning "foundation stone," is designed for use in anganwadis. What is the name of this curriculum?**

(a)  Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan
(b)  Poshan 2.0
(c)  Aadharshila
(d)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description directly refers to Aadharshila, the national curriculum for ECCE.  The other options are related to education and development programs but are not the specific curriculum described.  This question tests knowledge of a specific government initiative in the early childhood education sector.


**8.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) uses several parameters to rank educational institutions. Which of the following is NOT a parameter used in the NIRF ranking system?**

(a) Teaching, Learning, and Resources
(b) Research and Professional Practices
(c)  Financial Resources and Endowment
(d)  Graduation Outcomes


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text lists Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception as the parameters of NIRF.  Financial resources and endowment are not explicitly mentioned as a direct parameter in the provided text.  The other options are all components of the NIRF ranking methodology.  This question tests the ability to identify which factor is not part of a given system.


**9.  A report by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe presents findings on global hunger levels.  This report, which ranks countries based on the severity of hunger, places India in a particular category. In what category does this report place India based on its 2024 ranking?**

(a) Low
(b) Moderate
(c) Serious
(d) Alarming


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text states that India is ranked in the "serious" category in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024.  This indicates that while progress has been made, significant challenges in tackling hunger remain.  The other options represent different levels of severity on the GHI scale.


**10. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) aims to ensure the full enjoyment of human rights for a particular group. Which group does this convention primarily address?**

(a)  Elderly persons
(b)  Migrant workers
(c)  Persons with disabilities
(d)  Indigenous populations


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the UN-CRPD aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. The other options are important groups with specific rights, but the UN-CRPD focuses specifically on persons with disabilities.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.


**1.  A governmental initiative aims to improve infrastructure in tribal-majority villages, enhance digital connectivity, and bolster healthcare and educational facilities. Which of the following best encapsulates this initiative's overarching goal?**

(a)  Promoting sustainable tourism within tribal communities.
(b)  Developing enabling infrastructure to empower tribal populations.
(c)  Facilitating the transition of tribal communities to urban settings.
(d)  Preserving traditional tribal culture and heritage.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the described initiative directly addresses infrastructure development—roads (PM Gram Sadak Yojana), digital connectivity (Bharat Net), and improvements to health and education facilities (National Health Mission, Samagra Shiksha, Poshan).  These are all components designed to empower tribal communities by improving their access to essential services and opportunities.

Option (a) is incorrect as, while tourism might be a *component* of broader economic empowerment, it's not the central focus of the infrastructure development described. Option (c) is incorrect because the initiative focuses on improving conditions *within* tribal villages, not relocating them. Option (d) is too narrow; while cultural preservation may be a beneficial side effect, the core objective is infrastructural improvement for empowerment.


**2.  The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme utilizes a specific planning approach to ensure targeted and effective development. What is the central feature of this planning approach?**

(a)  A state-level, top-down approach prioritizing standardized development projects.
(b)  A community-based participatory approach involving extensive consultations with local stakeholders.
(c)  A micro-plan approach using Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans formulated at the village level.
(d)  A regional approach focusing on geographically contiguous PVTG settlements.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the text explicitly mentions the use of a "micro-plan approach through the formulation of Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans." This indicates a localized, tailored approach to development, unlike the more generalized options.

Option (a) is incorrect as it contradicts the nuanced approach described. Option (b), while incorporating elements of participation, doesn't capture the *specific* planning methodology employed.  Option (d) isn't the primary focus; while geographical proximity might be considered, the micro-plan approach prioritizes individual village needs.


**3. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) report highlights a significant correlation between several factors and global hunger levels. Which of the following factors is NOT explicitly mentioned in the provided text as a key contributor to hunger?**

(a)  Gender inequality
(b)  Climate change
(c)  Lack of access to quality education
(d)  Maternal malnutrition

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly links gender inequality, climate change, and maternal malnutrition to hunger.  While education is undoubtedly crucial for broader development and poverty reduction, the GHI report's findings, as presented, directly connect hunger to the other three factors.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are all explicitly mentioned as directly influencing hunger levels.  Option (c) is a plausible distractor because education is undeniably important for societal progress, but it's not highlighted in the text as a *direct* causal factor for the GHI findings.


**4.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024, released by UNEP and WRAP, focuses on measuring food waste at specific points in the food chain.  Which level(s) of the food chain does this report primarily cover?**

(a)  Production and post-harvest losses
(b)  Retail and consumer levels (household and food service)
(c)  Wholesale and transportation stages
(d)  Agricultural processing and packaging

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that the FWI tracks food waste at "retail and consumer (household and food service) levels."  This makes (b) the correct option.  The report's focus is on the final stages of the food chain, where consumer behavior plays a significant role in waste generation.

Options (a), (c), and (d) represent other stages of the food supply chain, but they are not the primary focus of the FWI Report as described.  The Food Loss Index (FLI) addresses option (a), but the question specifically asks about the FWI.


**5.  Several organizations play crucial roles in addressing global hunger. Which of the following is NOT explicitly mentioned in the provided text as having a direct role in combating global hunger?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty
(d)  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The WFP and FAO are explicitly mentioned as organizations directly involved in combating global hunger. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty also has this as its explicit aim.  The NQAS, while related to healthcare, is not directly involved in global hunger reduction efforts as described in the text.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are all involved in fighting hunger, either through direct aid (WFP), policy and research (FAO), or international collaboration (Global Alliance). Option (d), the NQAS, focuses on healthcare quality, which indirectly relates to nutrition but isn't a primary focus on fighting global hunger itself.


**6.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 introduced some significant changes to its ranking methodology. Which of the following is NOT a change introduced in the 2024 NIRF rankings?**

(a)  The inclusion of a new ranking category for Open Universities.
(b)  A shift in the weighting of research output compared to teaching quality.
(c)  The addition of ranking categories for State Public Universities.
(d)  The integration of an "Innovation" ranking into the existing framework.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions the addition of Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities as new categories.  The integration of an "Innovation" ranking is also noted.  However, there's no mention of a change in the weighting of research output versus teaching quality.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are all explicitly mentioned changes in the 2024 NIRF rankings.  Option (b) is a plausible distractor because research and teaching are both important aspects of university evaluation, but the text doesn't indicate any change in their relative weighting within the NIRF framework.


**7. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), grants a specific type of right to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). What is this right called?**

(a)  Land ownership rights
(b)  Subsistence farming rights
(c)  Habitat rights
(d)  Grazing rights

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that habitat rights are given to PVTGs under Section 3(1)(e) of the Forest Rights Act (FRA). This right is specifically defined in the FRA as encompassing customary and other habitats within reserved and protected forests.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are related to forest use, but the FRA specifically grants *habitat rights* to PVTGs, recognizing their unique relationship with their traditional environments.


**8.  The Supreme Court of India, in the case of *Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others*, addressed a critical issue related to a specific vulnerable group. Which group was the primary focus of this case?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs)
(c)  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)
(d)  Scheduled Tribes (STs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions that the Supreme Court case highlighted caste-based discrimination against Denotified Tribes (DNTs) within prisons.  The judgment struck down discriminatory provisions targeting DNTs and "habitual offenders."

Options (a), (b), and (d) represent other vulnerable groups, but the *Sukanya Santha* case specifically addressed the discriminatory practices against DNTs in the prison system.


**MCQs from Source Content:**

1. **Which of the following statements accurately describes the Nelson Mandela Award for Health Promotion for 2024?**

(a) It is awarded exclusively to individual recipients.
(b) It is awarded to both individuals and governmental organizations.
(c) It was established by the World Health Organization in 2019.
(d)  It is awarded to non-governmental organizations only.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The prompt does not offer a definitive answer regarding the specific award criteria for the Nelson Mandela Award for Health Promotion in 2024. Option (b) is the most plausible based on the general understanding of such awards, which often recognize both individual contributions and the efforts of organizations. Option (a) is too restrictive, while option (c) is incorrect based on the provided text. Option (d) is also incorrect as it is not mentioned in the text.

(d) Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC)


**Correct Answer:** (a) or (b) or (c) or (d)

**Explanation:** The provided text does not specify which Indian institution received the UN's WSIS 2024 'Champion' Award.  Therefore, without further information, none of the options can be definitively confirmed as correct. Each option represents a different prominent Indian institution involved in technological advancement, making them plausible distractors in the absence of the specific answer.


3. **Regarding 'Living Wills,' which statement is accurate?**

(a) It's a document specifying future medical actions if the person is incapacitated.
(b) It explicitly legalizes passive euthanasia for terminally ill patients.
(c) It mandates specific medical treatments in case of future incapacity.
(d) It only applies to individuals diagnosed with terminal illnesses.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** A living will is a legal document that outlines an individual's wishes regarding their medical care if they become unable to make decisions for themselves.  Option (b) is incorrect; while living wills may inform end-of-life decisions, they don't automatically legalize euthanasia.  Option (c) is incorrect because living wills focus on what *not* to do, rather than mandating treatment.  Option (d) is incorrect as living wills can be utilized by anyone concerned about future medical decision-making capacity, regardless of their health status.

Each option presents a plausible scenario related to university rankings, but without specific data from the QS rankings, none can be definitively confirmed as accurate.


5. **The Greening Education Partnership is an initiative led by:**

(a) The World Bank
(b) UNESCO
(c) UNICEF and UNEP
(d) The Green Climate Fund


**Correct Answer:** (b) or (a) or (c) or (d)

**Explanation:** The source text does not identify the lead organization for the Greening Education Partnership.  Each option represents an organization potentially involved in environmental or educational initiatives, making them plausible but unconfirmed answers.


6. **Regarding World Oceans Day, which statement is correct?**

(a) The concept was first proposed at the 1992 Earth Summit.
(b) The 2024 theme is "Planet Ocean: The Tides are Changing."
(c) It is celebrated annually on December 5th.
(d) It is primarily focused on marine biodiversity conservation in the Arctic.


**Correct Answer:** (a) or (b) or (c) or (d)

**Explanation:**  The text does not provide the precise date of the World Ocean Day celebration, nor the specific theme for 2024.  While option (a) is plausible, it cannot be definitively confirmed from the provided text.  Therefore, without specific information, none of the provided options can be verified as the correct answer.


7. **Which statements about 'Water Credit' are accurate?**

(a) It uses microfinance tools in the water and sanitation sector.
(b) It's a global initiative launched by the WHO and World Bank.
(c) It aims to help the poor access water without relying on subsidies.
(d) It primarily focuses on providing free water to underserved communities.


**Correct Answer:** (a) or (b) or (c) or (d)

**Explanation:** The text is inconclusive about the specific details of the "Water Credit" initiative.  While each option presents a possible aspect of a water-related microfinance program, none can be definitively confirmed without additional information.



8. **Which is NOT a key dimension measured by the Global Gender Gap Index?**

(a) Economic Participation and Opportunity
(b) Educational Attainment
(c) Health and Survival
(d) Environmental Sustainability


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Global Gender Gap Index typically focuses on economic participation, educational attainment, and health and survival.  Environmental sustainability is not a standard component of the index.



**UPSC Style MCQs based on Target Content:**


1.  **The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) defines 'habitat' as:**

(a)  The area encompassing the customary habitat of only primitive tribal groups.
(b)  The area comprising customary habitats in reserved and protected forests for specific tribal groups and forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.
(c)  Any area traditionally used by any forest-dwelling community, regardless of legal status.
(d)  The area exclusively used for agricultural practices by Scheduled Tribes.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The FRA's definition of 'habitat' is specifically tailored to include customary habitats within designated forest areas for certain tribal groups and forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes. Option (a) is too narrow, excluding other relevant groups. Option (c) is too broad and doesn't incorporate the legal framework of reserved and protected forests. Option (d) is inaccurate as it focuses only on agriculture and ignores other customary uses.


2. **Which state in India houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) according to the provided information?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Maharashtra
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

3. **The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme primarily aims to:**

(a)  Completely assimilate PVTGs into mainstream society.
(b)  Promote the socio-economic development of PVTGs while preserving their cultural heritage.
(c)  Relocate PVTGs to areas with better infrastructure.
(d)  Focus solely on improving the literacy rates of PVTGs.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The scheme's objective is clearly stated as comprehensive socio-economic development while respecting and maintaining the cultural identity of PVTGs. Options (a), (c), and (d) are either incorrect or represent only partial aspects of the scheme's goals.


4.  **Which of the following is NOT a criterion used for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Forest-based livelihoods
(b) High literacy rates
(c) Pre-agricultural level of existence
(d) Stagnant or declining population

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The criteria for identifying PVTGs include reliance on forest-based livelihoods, a pre-agricultural lifestyle, and a stagnant or declining population.  High literacy rates are not a characteristic of PVTGs.


5.  **The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is named after:**

(a)  Mahatma Gandhi
(b)  B.R. Ambedkar
(c)  Birsa Munda
(d)  Subhas Chandra Bose

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The scheme's name explicitly honors Birsa Munda, a significant tribal leader known for his resistance against British rule. The other options are incorrect.


6.  **A key goal of the PM-JUGA is to:**

(a)  Completely replace traditional tribal practices with modern methods.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The GHI report highlights the severity of hunger in many regions, making the 2030 goal unlikely. Option (a) is the opposite of the report's findings. Option (c) is incorrect; while the text states India's ranking improved, it remains in the "serious" category. Option (d) is incorrect, as the report links gender inequality to hunger.


8.  **Which of the following initiatives is NOT directly mentioned as a measure to tackle hunger in India?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)
(b) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(c) National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA)
(d) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The text mentions PMGKAY, PMMVY, and Saksham Anganwadi as hunger-reduction measures. NREGA, while beneficial for rural livelihoods, is not explicitly cited as a direct anti-hunger initiative in the provided text.

(a)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
(c)  PM Jan Arogya Yojana (Ayushman Bharat)
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), also known as Ayushman Bharat, is a national health insurance scheme providing health coverage to vulnerable populations, including Scheduled Tribes.  Options (a) and (d) focus on education and maternal health respectively, while option (b) concerns housing.  PM-JAY directly addresses the goal of improved healthcare access for ST households by providing financial protection against catastrophic health expenditures.  The scheme's extensive network of empaneled hospitals ensures access to a wide range of healthcare services, thus fulfilling the stated objective more accurately than the other options. The other options, while important for overall well-being, do not directly provide healthcare access in the same way as PM-JAY.


**2.  A scheme promotes sustainable livelihoods for forest right holders.  This initiative is most closely associated with which of the following?**

(a)  Swadesh Darshan
(b)  Skill India Mission
(c)  Sustainable Livelihoods - Forest Rights Holders (FRA) Mission
(d)  PM Gram Sadak Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sustainable Livelihoods - Forest Rights Holders (FRA) Mission explicitly targets the socio-economic empowerment of individuals holding Forest Rights Act (FRA) pattas.  Option (a) focuses on tourism promotion, (b) on skill development, and (d) on rural road infrastructure. While these initiatives might indirectly benefit FRA holders, the Sustainable Livelihoods Mission is the only one directly designed to improve their livelihoods by converging different schemes and focusing on their specific needs and challenges.  The direct link between the scheme and the empowerment of FRA patta holders makes it the most accurate answer.


**3.  The establishment of Centers of Competence (CoC) is aimed at improving diagnosis capabilities for a specific disease prevalent in certain regions.  Which disease is the primary focus of these CoCs?**

(a)  Tuberculosis
(b)  Malaria
(c)  Sickle Cell Disease
(d)  Covid-19


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions the establishment of Centers of Competence (CoC) in AIIMS and other premier institutes to enhance diagnostic facilities for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), particularly in regions with high prevalence.  The other options are not directly linked to the described initiative. While tuberculosis, malaria, and COVID-19 are significant public health concerns, the CoCs are specifically designed to address the diagnostic challenges associated with SCD. The focus on SCD, along with the specified location of the CoCs in areas where SCD is prevalent, makes this the only correct option.


**4. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) incorporates a new ranking category in its 2024 edition. Which type of institution is newly included in this ranking?**

(a)  Central Universities
(b)  Deemed Universities
(c)  Skill Universities
(d)  Private Engineering Colleges


**Correct Answer:** (c)

(b)  SDG 12.3.1 (a) (Reduce food loss)
(c)  SDG 12.3.1 (b) (Halve per capita food waste)
(d)  SDG 13.2 (Climate Action)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 directly relates to SDG 12.3.1 (b), which focuses on halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030.  While SDG 2.1 addresses ending hunger and SDG 13.2 concerns climate action, the report's specific focus on food waste at the retail and consumer levels makes SDG 12.3.1 (b) the most relevant indicator. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is the custodian of the Food Waste Index, highlighting its direct connection to this specific SDG target.  Option (b), while related to food waste, focuses on food loss during production and supply chains, not retail and consumer levels.


**6.  An initiative aims to provide instant issuance of food licenses and registrations through a pan-India IT platform. Which platform facilitates this process?**

(a)  Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM)
(b)  Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL)
(c)  Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS)
(d)  Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Spot Food License Initiative" uses the Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS) as its pan-India IT platform for instant license and registration issuance. Options (a), (b), and (d) relate to health infrastructure and standards but not to food licensing. FoSCoS is specifically designed to streamline the licensing process, making it the only relevant option.  The initiative's goal of simplification and speed directly points to FoSCoS as the enabling technology.


**7. A global report analyzes gender parity across four key dimensions. Which organization publishes this report annually?**

(a)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(b)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(c)  World Economic Forum (WEF)
(d)  International Monetary Fund (IMF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Report is published annually by the World Economic Forum (WEF). The report benchmarks gender parity across four dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.  The other organizations, while involved in various development and economic issues, are not associated with this specific report.  The WEF's focus on global economic and social issues makes it the logical publisher of such a report.


**8.  An initiative aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities through infrastructure development, health, education, and livelihood enhancements. Which program aligns with this description?**

(a)  National Health Mission
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(c)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
(d)  PM Gram Sadak Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) explicitly aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods. While the other options address some of these aspects, PM-JUGA is a comprehensive program designed to converge various schemes and interventions to achieve this goal.  The holistic approach and the focus on tribal communities make PM-JUGA the most suitable answer.


**9. Which act provides habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b)  The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996
(c)  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006
(d)  The National Food Security Act, 2013


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), specifically grants habitat rights to PVTGs under Section 3(1)(e).  The other acts deal with different aspects of social justice and welfare, but not with habitat rights for PVTGs. The FRA is the primary legislation that directly addresses the land and habitat rights of these vulnerable groups, making it the only correct option.


**10. A report highlights the need for increased investment in nutritious foods value chains to reduce gender inequalities and enhance business resilience. Which organization launched this report?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d)  Concern Worldwide


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions that GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) launched a report focusing on nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to reduce gender inequalities and improve business resilience.  The other organizations, while involved in food security and nutrition, are not the source of this specific report. GAIN's focus on nutrition and its advocacy for improved food systems make it the appropriate organization for this report.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and focuses on specific details within the text, avoiding ambiguity or trivial answers.


**1.  A global report assesses food waste at the retail and consumer levels, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.  Which organization is the custodian of the specific indicator that tracks the reduction in per capita global food waste at these levels, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?**

(a) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(b) World Food Programme (WFP)
(c) United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(d) Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the Food Waste Index (FWI) Report and its connection to SDG 12.3.1 (b).  The passage explicitly states that UNEP is the custodian of the FWI indicator, which focuses on halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels.  Option (a) is incorrect because FAO is responsible for the Food Loss Index (FLI), which tracks food losses along production and supply chains. Options (b) and (d) are involved in addressing food crises and food waste, respectively, but are not the custodians of the specific FWI indicator.  Understanding the roles of different UN agencies in the context of global food security is crucial for UPSC preparation.


**2. An Indian government initiative promotes healthcare access through virtual assessments and rapid licensing.  Which program provides instant issuance of food licenses and registrations via a pan-India IT platform, aiming to streamline licensing processes for the "Healthcare for All" initiative?**

(a) Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) Assessment
(b) Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) Assessment
(c) National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment
(d) Spot Food License Initiative


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question describes the dual approach of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to improve healthcare. While NQAS assesses AAMs and IPHLs, the Spot Food License Initiative uses FoSCoS for rapid licensing.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are components of the broader NQAS program focused on assessment and compliance, not on the immediate issuance of licenses.  This question tests the ability to differentiate between closely related initiatives within a larger government program, a common theme in UPSC questions.


**3.  A report analyzes gender inequality across various dimensions. Which organization published the Gender Inequality Index (GII) in 2022, as part of its Human Development Report, using a score ranging from 0 (equality) to 1 (maximum inequality)?**

(a) World Economic Forum (WEF)
(b) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c) World Health Organization (WHO)
(d) International Monetary Fund (IMF)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the GII and its source.  The passage clearly states that the UNDP released the GII 2022 as part of its Human Development Report. Options (a), (c), and (d) are significant international organizations, but they are not associated with the publication of the GII in the specified context. This question tests knowledge of international development organizations and their respective reports, an important aspect of UPSC preparation.


**4. A national initiative aims to reduce the burden of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). What ambitious target, as outlined in a specific roadmap, aims to significantly reduce the number of people needing NTD treatment by 2030?**

(a) A 50% reduction in NTD cases.
(b) Elimination of NTDs in high-burden countries.
(c) A 75% reduction in NTD-related mortality.
(d) A 90% reduction in the number of people requiring treatment.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the specific roadmap for NTDs ("Ending the Neglect to Attain Sustainable Development Goals"). The passage explicitly mentions a 90% reduction in the number of people needing treatment as a key goal. The other options are plausible but incorrect based on the provided text. This question tests factual recall and understanding of public health initiatives.


**5. A system in several countries governs the relationship between foreign workers and their sponsors. What system, prevalent in some Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and elsewhere, often requires worker sponsorship for employment changes, creating concerns about potential exploitation?**

(a) The Migrant Workers Protection Scheme
(b) The Kafala system
(c) The Guest Worker Program
(d) The Temporary Employment Scheme


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question describes a system with specific characteristics. The passage clearly identifies this as the Kafala system, highlighting its concerns regarding worker exploitation and limited mobility.  The other options are plausible names for worker programs but do not match the description provided. This question tests the ability to identify a specific socio-economic system based on its characteristics, requiring both factual recall and analysis.


**6. A new policy framework guides engagement with children's nutritional well-being. What framework focuses on both home-based and Anganwadi center engagement, incorporating age-appropriate screening for children with disabilities?**

(a) The National Nutrition Mission (NNM)
(b) The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
(c) The Poshan Abhiyaan
(d)  The provided text doesn't specify the name of the framework.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** While the text describes a framework for children's nutritional well-being, including home-based and Anganwadi center engagement and screening tools, it does *not* name the framework itself.  The other options are all related to nutrition and child development in India, but the provided text does not link them directly to the described framework. This question tests careful reading and the ability to distinguish between related but distinct concepts.


**7. A high-level committee was formed to address concerns about examination processes.  Who heads this committee tasked with recommending reforms in examination mechanisms, data security, and the National Testing Agency (NTA)?**

(a) Former ISRO chairman Dr. K. Radhakrishnan
(b)  The current Education Minister
(c) The chairman of the NTA
(d) A senior official from the Ministry of Education


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the leadership of a specific committee. The passage explicitly mentions that Dr. K. Radhakrishnan, former ISRO chairman, heads the committee.  The other options are plausible but incorrect based on the given information. This question tests factual recall and identification of key personnel involved in specific government initiatives.

(a) Promoting traditional tribal arts and crafts.
(b) Improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.
(c) Protecting tribal land rights and forest resources.
(d) Establishing tribal-specific educational institutions.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PM-JUGA scheme explicitly aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  While the scheme might indirectly support aspects like traditional arts (c) or education (d) through infrastructure development and skill-building initiatives, its core objective is to address the broader socio-economic disparities faced by tribal populations. The scheme’s focus on convergence of existing schemes and saturation of critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood directly addresses socio-economic needs.  The name itself, inspired by Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known for his resistance against British rule, highlights a commitment to empowering tribal communities.  The scheme's emphasis on convergence and outreach ensures a holistic approach, unlike narrowly focused initiatives on land rights (c) or education (d).

This initiative is a crucial step towards making quality education more accessible and relevant to diverse linguistic communities across India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.

**1.  A global initiative promoting the rights and inclusion of individuals with disabilities, adopted in 2006 and entering into force in 2008,  is primarily focused on which of the following?**

(a)  Facilitating economic empowerment through vocational training programs specifically designed for disabled individuals.
(b)  Establishing quotas for employment and political representation for people with disabilities across all sectors.
(c)  Promoting the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.
(d)  Providing comprehensive healthcare services tailored to the specific needs of people with diverse disabilities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is centrally concerned with ensuring that people with disabilities have the same rights and opportunities as everyone else. While options (a), (b), and (d) are important aspects of disability inclusion, they are not the core objective of the UN-CRPD.  The convention's focus is on a broader framework of rights, encompassing all aspects of life, from participation in society to access to justice and education.  It aims to shift perspectives from viewing disability as a problem to be solved to recognizing it as a matter of human rights. The convention emphasizes the inherent dignity of persons with disabilities and strives to create an inclusive society where they can fully participate.


**2. The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), launched to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, draws inspiration from which historical figure and movement?**

(a)  Mahatma Gandhi and the Non-Cooperation Movement.
(b)  Bhagat Singh and the Hindustan Republican Association.
(c)  Birsa Munda and the Ulgulan movement.
(d)  Subhas Chandra Bose and the Forward Bloc.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** PM-JUGA explicitly honors Birsa Munda, a prominent tribal leader known as "Dharti Aaba," who led the Ulgulan ("The Great Tumult") movement against British rule.  This movement, characterized by its resistance against colonial exploitation and its emphasis on tribal self-determination, serves as a powerful historical context for the PM-JUGA initiative.  The other options are incorrect as they represent different leaders and movements, not directly related to the scheme's focus on uplifting tribal communities.  The choice of Birsa Munda signifies the government's acknowledgment of the historical struggle for tribal rights and its commitment to addressing ongoing socio-economic disparities within these communities.

(a)  A purely activity-based learning approach with minimal structured learning.
(b)  A rigid, standardized curriculum that emphasizes rote learning and memorization.
(c)  The Panchakosha concept, encompassing physical, pranic, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development.
(d)  A Montessori-method based curriculum focused on self-directed learning through sensory activities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Adharshila curriculum explicitly integrates the Panchakosha concept, which is a holistic approach to child development.  This framework acknowledges the interconnectedness of physical, pranic (life energy), emotional, intellectual, and spiritual dimensions of a child's growth.  While Adharshila incorporates play-based learning, it is not solely activity-based, nor is it a rigid, rote learning model.  It also deviates from a purely Montessori approach, although certain aspects might overlap.  The emphasis on a multi-faceted development aligns perfectly with the Panchakosha framework, which seeks to nurture well-rounded individuals.


**5. Which of the following statements accurately reflects the findings of the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 concerning India?**

(a) India achieved a significant improvement, moving from the "alarming" to the "serious" category.
(b) India's GHI score improved, though child wasting and stunting remain significant concerns.
(c) India's GHI score worsened, indicating a decline in nutritional status.
(d) India achieved "zero hunger" status, meeting the SDG goal ahead of schedule.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The GHI 2024 shows India's score improved, reflecting progress in reducing hunger.  However, the report also highlights that child wasting and stunting remain substantial challenges, indicating that much work remains to be done. Option (a) is incorrect because India remained in the "serious" category, not moving to a less severe classification.  Option (c) is also incorrect, as India's score improved.  Option (d) is factually incorrect, as the report indicates that the global goal of "zero hunger" by 2030 remains unattainable.

(c)  Indian law explicitly prohibits live-in relationships unless registered under a specific national act.
(d)  Supreme Court judgments have broadened the recognition of live-in partnerships, granting certain rights and protections to partners.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While India does not have a uniform national law specifically governing live-in relationships, the Supreme Court has progressively addressed the legal aspects of these relationships through several landmark judgments. These judgments have acknowledged live-in relationships as legally valid in certain contexts, granting rights such as inheritance rights to children born out of such relationships and protection under the Domestic Violence Act. The Supreme Court has established guidelines for handling property disputes and other issues arising from these relationships. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they present oversimplified or inaccurate portrayals of the current legal status of live-in relationships in India. The complexity of the legal landscape surrounding live-in relationships stems from the lack of a codified law but the evolving judicial interpretations. This question tests conceptual understanding of Indian legal frameworks and their application to evolving social realities.

(c)  Women working in the informal sector, achieving a monthly income of ₹50,000.
(d)  Female agricultural laborers, achieving a land ownership of at least one hectare.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The "Lakhpati Didi" initiative is directly aimed at empowering women members of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in rural areas. The economic goal is to enable three crore women to achieve an annual household income of ₹1 lakh or more, demonstrating a sustained improvement in their financial status.  Options (a), (c), and (d) describe different target groups or economic goals that are not consistent with the Lakhpati Didi initiative. The correct option showcases an understanding of the initiative's focus on rural women's economic empowerment through SHGs. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of specific government initiatives aimed at women's empowerment.


**5. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, grants a specific type of right to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). What type of right is granted, and under which section of the Act?**

(a)  Grazing rights, under Section 3(1)(a)
(b)  Fishing rights, under Section 3(1)(c)
(c)  Habitat rights, under Section 3(1)(e)
(d)  Hunting rights, under Section 3(1)(d)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, also known as the Forest Rights Act (FRA), explicitly grants habitat rights to PVTGs under Section 3(1)(e).  Habitat rights encompass the area comprising the customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests.  Options (a), (b), and (d) refer to other forest rights granted under the Act, but not specifically to PVTGs in the context of their habitat.

It assesses the ability to identify the specific organization associated with a given initiative.


**8. Which of the following correctly identifies the three types of nomadic communities highlighted in a Supreme Court judgment related to denotified tribes?**

(a)  Agriculturalists, artisans, and traders
(b)  Fishermen, forest dwellers, and pastoralists
(c)  Hunter-gatherers, pastoral communities, and peripatetic groups
(d)  Urban dwellers, rural laborers, and migrant workers


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court judgment in the Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others case highlighted three distinct types of nomadic communities: hunter-gatherers (those who hunt and gather for subsistence), pastoral communities (those who herd livestock), and peripatetic groups (those who travel from place to place, engaging in various occupations like trading, storytelling, or performing arts).  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the specific categories of nomadic communities identified in the Supreme Court judgment. The question assesses the ability to recall specific details from a legal judgment and demonstrates understanding of the social and economic characteristics of nomadic groups. This tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  Each question is designed to be challenging, with plausible distractors.  The difficulty level is primarily "difficult" due to the need for precise recall and nuanced understanding of the concepts.


**1.  A global index tracks hunger levels worldwide, revealing alarming levels in numerous countries, impacting the "Zero Hunger" goal.  This index also highlights the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and food insecurity, particularly affecting women and girls. Which organization is primarily responsible for publishing this index?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
(d)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is published annually by Concern Worldwide (Ireland) and Welthungerhilfe (Germany).  While the WFP, FAO, and UNDP all work on food security and nutrition, they are not the primary publishers of the GHI. The question highlights the key findings of the GHI, making it more challenging to recall the specific publishing organizations. The distractors are plausible because these organizations are heavily involved in global food security initiatives. The correct answer requires precise knowledge of the GHI's origins.


**2.  India's performance in a specific global index related to nutrition places it in the "serious" category, with a significant percentage of its population suffering from undernourishment and high rates of child wasting and stunting.  This index also points to a link between maternal malnutrition and child undernutrition. Which index is being described?**

(a)  Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)
(b)  Gender Inequality Index (GII)
(c)  Global Hunger Index (GHI)
(d)  Food Waste Index (FWI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description clearly points to the Global Hunger Index (GHI). The question uses the specific details of India's ranking and the issues highlighted by the index (undernourishment, child wasting, stunting, maternal malnutrition) to make the question more difficult. The distractors are plausible as they are other relevant global indices, but they do not focus on hunger and malnutrition in the specific way described.  Understanding the scope of each index is crucial for selecting the correct answer.


**3.  A centrally sponsored scheme in India aims for the comprehensive socio-economic development of specific vulnerable tribal groups while preserving their cultural heritage. This scheme provides financial assistance for various initiatives, including education, housing, and infrastructure development.  What is the name of this scheme?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(c)  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(d)  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The description accurately outlines the "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme."  The question focuses on the scheme's aims and activities, making it more challenging than simply asking for the name.  The distractors are other Indian government schemes related to social welfare and nutrition, but they do not specifically target the socio-economic development of PVTGs.  The ability to differentiate between the objectives of various schemes is key to answering correctly.


**4.  A methodology for ranking educational institutions in India, launched in 2015, employs five parameters to assess teaching, learning, research, graduation outcomes, outreach, and perception.  Recently, an "Innovation" ranking was integrated into this framework. Which framework is being described?**

(a)  QS World University Rankings
(b)  Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings
(c)  University Impact Rankings
(d)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question describes the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF). The detailed description of the ranking parameters and the recent addition of the "Innovation" ranking makes the question more difficult.  The distractors are other well-known global university ranking systems, but they are not the Indian framework being described.  Careful reading and understanding of the specific details of each ranking system are essential to answer this question.


**5. The Government of India issued a Letter of Intent (LoI) to a UK university to establish a campus in Gurugram, marking the first international university campus under specific regulations aimed at enhancing higher education. Which regulations govern this establishment?**

(a)  Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA)
(b)  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023
(c)  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020
(d)  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question specifically refers to the regulations that govern the establishment of foreign university campuses in India.  The correct answer is the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023. While NEP 2020 envisioned this, it's the specific regulations that are the answer. FEMA and FDI policy are relevant to foreign investment but don't directly address the establishment of university campuses.  The precise knowledge of the relevant regulations is crucial here.


**6.  A report focusing on the financing needed to eliminate hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition defines financing as encompassing public and private resources, both domestic and foreign, directed towards improving food availability, access, utilization, and stability. Which report presents this definition?**

(a)  Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)
(b)  Food Waste Index Report 2024
(c)  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024
(d)  The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes the specific definition of financing for food security and nutrition as presented in the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024. The other options are related reports on food security and nutrition, but they do not provide the specific definition given in the question.  The detailed description of the definition makes the question more demanding and requires a precise understanding of the report's focus.


**7. A global standard framework for producing health accounts, facilitating international comparisons of health expenditures by consumption, provision, and financing, is a collaborative effort between which organizations?**

(a) World Bank, IMF, and UN
(b)  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), World Health Organization (WHO), and Eurostat
(c)  G20, WHO, and UNICEF
(d)  BRICS, WHO, and UN


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question describes the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011, which is a collaborative effort between the OECD, WHO, and Eurostat.  The other options list organizations involved in global health and finance, but they are not the specific partners that developed the SHA 2011.  Knowing the precise collaboration behind the SHA framework is necessary to answer correctly.


**8.  An initiative promoting nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to reduce gender inequalities, increase productivity, and enhance business resilience was launched by which organization?**

(a)  UN Women
(b)  UNICEF
(c)  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d)  World Food Programme (WFP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) launched the report "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains." The other options are organizations working on related issues, but GAIN is the specific organization that launched this particular report.  The precise knowledge of the launching organization is key to answering this question accurately.


**9.  A digital platform for real-time monitoring of public health facilities, providing an assessment and compliance overview, is used in compliance with Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) and is part of a broader initiative to promote healthcare. What is the name of this digital platform?**

(a)  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)
(b)  National Health Mission (NHM)
(c)  Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS)
(d)  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  While the NQAS assessment uses IPHS, IPHS itself is the digital platform.  The question's description focuses on the platform's functions and its role in promoting healthcare, making it more challenging than simply asking for the name.  The distractors are related initiatives and standards in the Indian healthcare system, but they do not represent the digital platform itself.


**10.  Which organization released the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, which uses the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) to benchmark gender parity across four key dimensions?**

(a)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(b)  World Bank
(c)  World Economic Forum (WEF)
(d)  International Monetary Fund (IMF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The World Economic Forum (WEF) publishes the Global Gender Gap Report. The question tests knowledge of the organization responsible for a specific report and its associated index.  The distractors are other international organizations that deal with development and economic issues, but they do not publish this particular report.  The precise association is key to answering this question.


**1.  The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, underwent significant amendments recently. Which entity played a pivotal role in finalizing these amendments?**

(a) The World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) The World Bank
(c) The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
(d) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), concluded its 77th annual meeting with an agreement on crucial amendments to the IHR, 2005.  The WHO, as the global authority on public health, is responsible for setting international standards and collaborating with member states to prevent and respond to public health emergencies. The other options are involved in global development and finance, but not directly in the amendment process of the IHR.  The WHA's role is central to international health governance, making (a) the only correct answer. The amendments reflect a global effort to improve pandemic preparedness and response, based on experiences with previous outbreaks, demonstrating the importance of international cooperation and the WHO's role as a facilitator.  The process of amending the IHR requires consensus among member states, highlighting the complexities of international law and the importance of the WHO’s diplomatic and coordination efforts. The amendments also signify a commitment to strengthening global health security and improving the capacity of countries, particularly developing countries, to respond effectively to future public health threats.  This requires international collaboration, financial support, and robust regulatory frameworks, all of which are facilitated by the WHO.


**2.  A new definition of "pandemic emergency" was included in the recent amendments to the IHR.  What key characteristic is now a defining feature of this term?**

(a)  High mortality rate
(b)  Presence of a novel pathogen
(c)  Significant impact on global trade
(d)  Wide geographical spread or high risk thereof, exceeding national response capacity

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The amendments to the IHR redefine a pandemic emergency to include a communicable disease with "wide geographical spread" or a high risk of such spread, and that exceeds or can exceed the ability of national health systems to respond. While high mortality rates, novel pathogens, and impact on global trade are significant factors in public health emergencies, the defining feature of the new definition emphasizes the scale of the outbreak and the strain on national health systems. A disease might have a high mortality rate but remain localized, or a novel pathogen might not spread widely.  The focus on exceeding national response capacity highlights the need for international collaboration and support during pandemics.  Option (d) directly reflects the amended definition, making it the correct answer. The other options, while relevant to pandemic severity, are not the primary defining criteria as outlined in the amendment. This shift in focus towards response capacity underscores the importance of preparedness and resource allocation in managing global health crises.


**3. The amendments to the IHR, 2005, established a new mechanism to address the needs of developing countries. What is the nature of this mechanism?**

(a)  A new global health fund
(b)  A system of technical assistance
(c)  A coordinating financial mechanism
(d)  A debt relief program


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The amendments to the IHR established a coordinating financial mechanism to address the needs and priorities of developing countries. This mechanism aims to improve funding for pandemic preparedness and response in countries with limited resources. While a global health fund (a) might be a component of the broader strategy, the amendment specifically mentions a coordinating mechanism, implying a more structured approach to resource allocation and coordination. Technical assistance (b) is important but does not address the financial constraints directly. Debt relief (d) is unrelated to the immediate needs of pandemic response.  Option (c) accurately reflects the focus of the new mechanism, which is to improve coordination of financial resources for effective IHR implementation in developing countries. The mechanism aims to ensure that funding is available and efficiently utilized to strengthen health systems and improve pandemic preparedness. This highlights the importance of equitable access to resources and the recognition that effective global health security requires support for all countries, particularly those with limited resources.


**4.  Which international treaty, updated recently, aims to define countries' rights and obligations in managing cross-border public health emergencies?**

(a) The Paris Agreement
(b) The Convention on Biological Diversity
(c) The International Health Regulations (IHR)
(d) The Convention on the Rights of the Child


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) are the international treaty that defines countries' rights and obligations in handling public health events and emergencies with cross-border potential. The recent amendments reflect the lessons learned from recent pandemics and aim to improve the effectiveness of the IHR in preventing and responding to future threats.  The Paris Agreement (a) focuses on climate change, the Convention on Biological Diversity (b) on biodiversity conservation, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (d) on children's rights.  None of these treaties directly address the specific issue of cross-border public health emergencies.  Therefore, only (c) correctly identifies the relevant international treaty. The updated IHR exemplifies the evolving nature of international cooperation in addressing global health challenges.  The amendments demonstrate a commitment to strengthening global health security through improved surveillance, response mechanisms, and international collaboration.


**5.  The World Health Assembly (WHA) has several key functions. Which of the following is NOT a primary function of the WHA?**

(a) Determining the policies of the WHO
(b) Appointing the Director-General of the WHO
(c) Overseeing the WHO's financial policies
(d) Directly managing national health systems in member states


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO). Its primary functions include determining WHO policies, appointing the Director-General, and supervising financial policies. However, the WHA does not directly manage national health systems within individual member states.  That responsibility rests with the respective governments of those countries.  The WHA provides guidance, sets standards, and fosters international cooperation, but the implementation of health policies and management of national health systems falls under the purview of each member state.  Option (d) is therefore the only incorrect statement. The WHA’s role is primarily focused on establishing international norms, coordinating global health efforts, and providing technical assistance to member states, rather than directly managing national health systems.  This reflects the principle of national sovereignty and the importance of tailored approaches to health systems strengthening.


**6.  The recent amendments to the IHR aim to improve coordination among countries.  Which specific mechanism was created to enhance this coordination?**

(a)  A new global health summit
(b)  A network of regional health offices
(c)  Creation of National IHR Authorities
(d)  A centralized global health database


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The amendments to the IHR include the creation of National IHR Authorities to improve coordination among countries.  These authorities will serve as focal points within each country for the implementation of the IHR, facilitating communication and collaboration with other nations and the WHO. While a global health summit (a) or a network of regional health offices (b) could contribute to coordination, the amendments specifically mention the establishment of national authorities as the key mechanism for enhanced coordination. A centralized global health database (d), while useful, is not the primary mechanism for improving coordination among countries. Option (c) directly addresses the mechanism created by the amendments to improve inter-country coordination concerning the IHR.  The establishment of these national authorities highlights the importance of national ownership and responsibility in implementing international health regulations.  This decentralized approach recognizes the unique contexts and challenges faced by different countries and aims to empower them to effectively participate in global health security efforts.


**7.  What was the predecessor to the International Health Regulations (IHR)?**

(a) The World Health Charter
(b) The International Sanitary Regulations (1951)
(c) The Geneva Convention
(d) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The International Sanitary Regulations (1951) were the predecessor to the International Health Regulations (IHR).  The IHR, adopted in 2005, replaced the 1951 regulations, incorporating lessons learned and expanding the scope to address a broader range of public health threats. The World Health Charter (a) is a foundational document outlining WHO's objectives, but not a direct predecessor to the IHR. The Geneva Conventions (c) address the treatment of prisoners of war and other protected persons during armed conflict. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (d) is a cornerstone document of international human rights law.  None of these are directly related to international health regulations. Option (b) correctly identifies the direct predecessor to the IHR, showcasing the evolution of global health governance and the adaptation of international instruments to address emerging challenges.  The replacement of the 1951 regulations highlights the dynamic nature of international public health and the need for regular review and updates to ensure effectiveness.


**8. In the context of the amendments to the IHR, what does "States Parties Committee" refer to?**

(a) A committee of WHO member states responsible for enforcing the IHR
(b) A committee of experts advising the WHO on IHR implementation
(c) A committee of international organizations involved in global health
(d) A committee of civil society groups advocating for IHR reform


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**  The "States Parties Committee" established through the IHR amendments is a committee of WHO member states responsible for effective IHR implementation. This committee will play a crucial role in monitoring the implementation of the regulations, resolving disputes, and ensuring accountability among member states.  While a committee of experts (b) might provide advice, the States Parties Committee is specifically composed of member states, giving it authority regarding enforcement.  International organizations (c) and civil society groups (d) may contribute to the process, but the primary responsibility for implementation and enforcement rests with the member states themselves. Option (a) accurately reflects the nature and function of the States Parties Committee.  Its establishment underscores the importance of collective action and shared responsibility in achieving global health security. The committee's role in monitoring and enforcement reflects the evolving understanding of international cooperation in addressing global public health challenges.

Option (a) is too narrow, focusing only on emergency aid, while (b) is one possible strategy but not the overarching goal. Option (d) is not mentioned in the provided text. The alliance's comprehensive approach to tackling multiple SDGs makes (c) the most accurate description of its primary goal.


**2. The 77th World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting concluded with amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005. Which of the following is NOT a key amendment adopted during the meeting?**

(a) Defining a pandemic emergency based on geographical spread and national health system capacity.
(b) Establishing a global health insurance scheme for developing countries.
(c) Creating a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation.
(d) Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to assist developing countries.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The WHA amendments focused on improving global pandemic preparedness and response.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are all key amendments directly mentioned in the text. Option (b), suggesting a global health insurance scheme, is not among the listed amendments. While improved access to healthcare is crucial, the amendments did not create a global insurance scheme, but rather a financial mechanism to address the needs of developing countries in handling health emergencies.


**3.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India.  Which of the following is NOT a stated goal of this initiative?**

(a)  Providing all-weather road connectivity to tribal villages.
(b)  Implementing a nationwide tribal language preservation program.
(c)  Ensuring access to quality healthcare facilities for tribal households.
(d)  Promoting skill development and entrepreneurship among tribal communities.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** PM-JUGA focuses on infrastructure development, healthcare access, livelihood improvement, and skill development within tribal communities.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are directly mentioned as goals or components of the Abhiyan.  Option (b), a language preservation program, is not a stated goal of PM-JUGA. While cultural preservation is important, the Abhiyan’s primary focus is on socio-economic upliftment.


**4.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 highlights the severity of hunger globally. Which of the following statements about the GHI 2024 findings concerning India is INCORRECT?**

(a) India's GHI score improved compared to 2023.
(b) Child wasting and stunting remain high in India.
(c)  India's ranking improved significantly, moving out of the "serious" hunger category.
(d) Maternal malnutrition contributes to child undernutrition in India.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The GHI 2024 report shows India's ranking improved but it remains in the "serious" category. Options (a), (b), and (d) are accurate reflections of the report's findings on India.  Option (c) is incorrect because, while the ranking improved, India still falls under the "serious" category of hunger. This highlights that despite progress, significant challenges remain in addressing malnutrition and hunger in India.


**5. The National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates provide insights into India's healthcare financing.  Which of the following is NOT a key component considered in the NHA estimates?**

(a) Government-funded health insurance schemes (e.g., PMJAY).
(b) Private health insurance expenditures.
(c)  Expenditures on traditional medicine and alternative therapies.
(d) External/donor funding for health.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NHA estimates encompass government spending on health, private health insurance, and external funding. Option (a), (b), and (d) are explicitly mentioned as being included in the NHA estimates.  Option (c), while relevant to overall healthcare spending, is not specifically listed as a component of the NHA estimates provided in the text.  The focus of the NHA is on the major streams of funding within the healthcare system.


**6.  Draft guidelines for passive euthanasia in India have been released. Which of the following is NOT a key highlight of these guidelines?**

(a)  The establishment of Primary and Secondary Medical Boards for review.
(b)  A clear definition of "terminal illness" and conditions for withdrawing life support.
(c)  The automatic granting of euthanasia requests upon the patient's consent.
(d)  The involvement of a Clinical Ethics Committee for oversight and conflict resolution.


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:** The guidelines emphasize a rigorous process involving medical boards and ethics committees to ensure ethical considerations are met. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately represent aspects of the guidelines. Option (c) is incorrect because the guidelines do not allow for automatic granting of euthanasia requests.  The process involves multiple layers of review and approval to prevent abuse and ensure due diligence.


**7. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006 provides habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). Which of the following statements about habitat rights under the FRA is most accurate?**

(a) Habitat rights are granted only to PVTGs residing in protected forests.
(b)  Habitat rights are automatically granted upon application by any tribal community.
(c) Habitat rights are granted under Section 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006.
(d) Habitat rights only cover the right to reside on the land and not the right to use forest resources.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly states that habitat rights are granted under Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are either incorrect or incomplete.  Habitat rights are not limited to protected forests, nor are they automatically granted.  Furthermore, habitat rights often include the right to use forest resources for sustenance.  Therefore, only (c) accurately describes the legal basis for habitat rights under the FRA.


**8.  The  Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, regulates organ donation in India.  Which statement about this act is INCORRECT?**

(a) The Act allows organ harvesting from living donors.
(b) The Act prohibits commercial dealings in human organs.
(c) The Act primarily governs organ donation from brain-dead patients only.
(d) The Act regulates the removal, storage, and transplantation of human organs and tissues.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Act covers both living and brain-dead donors.  Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect provisions of the Act. Option (c) is incorrect as the act encompasses organ donation from both living donors and brain-dead patients.  The emphasis is on ethical and regulated procedures, regardless of the donor's status.


**9.  The  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) aims to protect the rights of persons with disabilities.  Which of the following statements about the UN-CRPD is FALSE?**

(a) It promotes the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for all persons with disabilities.
(b)  It entered into force in 2006.
(c) India is a signatory to the UN-CRPD.
(d)  It defines persons with disabilities to include those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The convention entered into force in 2008, not 2006. Options (a), (c), and (d) are accurate statements about the UN-CRPD. Option (b) is incorrect concerning the date of the convention's entry into force.  The convention was adopted in 2006 but entered into force two years later, in 2008.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.


**1.  A crucial government initiative aims to comprehensively uplift Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) while preserving their cultural heritage. This initiative, funded entirely by the central government, employs a micro-planning approach through specific development plans. Which of the following best describes this initiative?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
(b) Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme
(c) PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi
(d) National Food Security Act


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question describes the "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme," which aligns perfectly with the description provided.  The scheme's core objective is the socio-economic development of PVTGs while safeguarding their cultural identity. The 100% central funding and the use of Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans as a micro-planning approach are explicitly mentioned in the source material. Options (a), (c), and (d) are unrelated schemes focused on financial inclusion, farmer income support, and food security respectively.  These initiatives, while important for overall societal development, do not directly address the specific needs and challenges of PVTGs in the manner described in the question.  The detailed description in the question is designed to test the candidate's ability to connect the described features with the correct scheme, distinguishing it from similar government programs.


**2.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006 grants specific rights to certain forest-dwelling communities.  These rights, granted after extensive consultations, encompass customary habitats and other relevant forest areas.  Which of the following tribal groups in Odisha have been granted these rights according to the provided information?**

(a)  Chenchus and Konda Reddis
(b)  Bharias and Kamars
(c)  Paudi Bhuyans, Saora tribals, Juang, Chuktia Bhunjia, Hill Khadia, Dongria Kondhs, and Mankidia tribe
(d)  Maria Gond and Baigas


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question specifically focuses on the tribal groups in Odisha that have been granted habitat rights under the FRA.  Option (c) accurately lists the seven Odisha-based tribal groups explicitly mentioned as having received these rights. Options (a), (b), and (d) list tribal groups from other states (Andhra Pradesh/Telangana, Madhya Pradesh/Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra respectively). This question tests the candidate's ability to extract specific details from a larger body of information, requiring precise recall of the listed tribal groups and their location. The inclusion of multiple tribal groups in option (c) increases the difficulty level, requiring careful reading and attention to detail.


**3.  Several criteria are used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). These criteria assess various socioeconomic factors and demographic characteristics. Which of the following is NOT a criterion typically used to identify PVTGs?**

(a)  Pre-agricultural level of existence
(b)  High literacy rates
(c)  Stagnant or declining population
(d)  Subsistence economy


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The question asks to identify a factor that is *not* used as a criterion for identifying PVTGs. The source material explicitly states that stagnant or declining population, pre-agricultural existence, low literacy, and a subsistence economy are used as criteria.  Option (b), "High literacy rates," is the opposite of a criterion used; PVTGs are characterized by extremely low literacy rates. The other options are all listed as criteria for identifying PVTGs. This question tests both factual recall and the ability to identify an exception within a set of criteria, challenging the candidate to understand the characteristics of PVTGs.  The use of a negative phrasing ("NOT a criterion") further increases the difficulty.


**4.  The "Global Hunger Index (GHI)" is an annual report that assesses hunger levels across countries.  The 2024 report revealed several concerning trends.  According to the information provided, which of the following statements accurately reflects a finding of the 2024 GHI concerning India?**

(a) India's GHI score improved significantly in 2024, showing a substantial reduction in hunger.
(b)  India ranked among the top 20 countries with the lowest hunger levels in the 2024 GHI.
(c)  India's GHI score placed it in the "serious" category, highlighting persistent challenges in child nutrition.
(d) India achieved "Zero Hunger" status, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 target.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the findings of the 2024 GHI report regarding India. Option (c) correctly states that India's ranking placed it in the "serious" category and highlights persistent issues with child nutrition (stunting and wasting). Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. Option (a) contradicts the report's findings; while there was an improvement in ranking, it does not represent a significant reduction in hunger. Option (b) is false, as India ranked 105th out of 127 countries. Option (d) is incorrect; the report indicates that the world is far from achieving "Zero Hunger." This question tests the ability to interpret data from a report and accurately identify specific findings related to a particular country. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options increases the difficulty level.


**5.  A recent amendment to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, addresses the need for improved global responses to public health emergencies.  This amendment establishes a financial mechanism to support developing nations. Which of the following best describes the purpose of this new financial mechanism?**

(c)  Universalizing access to quality education.
(d)  Implementing nationwide caste-based reservation policies.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question asks to identify a goal that is NOT a primary focus of the PM-JUGA.  The scheme focuses on infrastructure development, economic empowerment through skill development and livelihood initiatives, and improving access to education. Option (d), "Implementing nationwide caste-based reservation policies," is not a stated goal of PM-JUGA; while caste-based reservations exist in India, this is a separate policy domain and not a central focus of this specific initiative.  The other options are all explicitly mentioned as goals of the PM-JUGA.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the scheme's objectives and the ability to differentiate it from broader government policies on social justice.  The inclusion of a seemingly relevant but ultimately incorrect option increases the difficulty.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question assesses factual recall about the funding source. The initiative is explicitly stated to be funded through existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. Option (a) is incorrect because the initiative leverages existing funds, not a newly created one. Option (b) is incorrect as the text makes no mention of international funding. Option (d) is incorrect and ethically problematic; the initiative aims for upliftment, not land privatization.  The correct answer demonstrates understanding of the government's financial mechanisms for social welfare programs, a crucial aspect of governance and public policy questions in the UPSC exam.


**4.  Under the initiative to empower tribal communities, which of the following is a strategy employed to enhance marketing and sales for tribal products?**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), is the relevant legislation.  The text specifies that habitat rights are granted to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), a key characteristic of which is a pre-agricultural level of existence. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; they refer to different acts and criteria not relevant to habitat rights. The correct answer demonstrates knowledge of relevant legislation and the social context of tribal communities, a crucial aspect of Indian social issues in the UPSC syllabus.

Options (a), (b), and (c) refer to broader categories of communities in India, while the question implies a targeted initiative for a more specific group.  The information provided strongly suggests that the scheme is aimed at preventing the decline in the Parsi population, making (d) the only correct answer.


**5. A national curriculum for early childhood care and education (ECCE), covering children aged three to six, has been recently launched. This curriculum, structured around a 48-week plan, emphasizes play-based learning and includes an age-appropriate screening tool for early identification of developmental needs. What is the name of this recently launched curriculum?**

(a)  Bal Vikas Yojana
(b)  Aadharshila
(c)  Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan
(d)  National Education Policy


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description precisely matches the characteristics of "Aadharshila," the National Curriculum for ECCE.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are related to education but do not specifically address the 48-week play-based curriculum with an integrated screening tool for early childhood development.  Aadharshila's focus on play-based learning and early identification of developmental needs aligns directly with the description, making it the only accurate answer.  The other options are broader educational initiatives, not specifically focused on ECCE in the manner described.


**6.  The establishment of a new research foundation under an act of 2023, subsuming a previous scientific research board, aims to foster a culture of research and innovation across India. This foundation has secured significant funding, both from government sources and private investment, to support various research initiatives. What is the name of this research foundation?**

(a)  Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
(b)  National Research Foundation (NRF)
(c)  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)
(d)  Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description indicates the creation of a new research foundation under a 2023 act, absorbing a previous entity, and securing substantial funding from government and private sources.  This directly points to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF).  While (a) mentions the previous entity that was subsumed, (b) and (d) are other significant research organizations in India but don’t match the description of a newly established foundation under a 2023 act.  The specifics of the description strongly suggest ANRF as the correct answer.


**7.  A government program provides financial support to self-help groups (SHGs), aiming to increase women's annual household income to at least ₹1 lakh. This program, operating under the Ministry of Rural Development, has recently disbursed a substantial revolving fund. What is the name of this initiative?**

(a)  Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM)
(b)  Lakhpati Didi Initiative
(c)  Mahila Shakti Kendra
(d)  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description clearly focuses on the "Lakhpati Didi" initiative, which aims to empower women through SHGs and increase their income to ₹1 lakh annually.  While (a) is the overarching program under which this initiative operates, the question specifically asks about the initiative targeting women's income enhancement.  (c) and (d) are unrelated government programs. The detail about the revolving fund further strengthens the connection to the Lakhpati Didi initiative, making (b) the most precise answer.


**8.  A committee report highlighted instances of exploitation and sexual harassment of women within a specific industry, underscoring the ongoing issue of workplace harassment.  Which act provides a mechanism for addressing and preventing such harassment?**

(a)  The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976
(b)  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act)
(c)  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(d)  The Indian Penal Code, 1860


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question explicitly refers to sexual harassment at the workplace, making the POSH Act the most relevant legislation.  While other acts address related issues such as equal pay or domestic violence, they don't directly deal with workplace sexual harassment.  The POSH Act specifically addresses this issue by establishing internal and local complaints committees to handle such complaints and provide redressal.  The other options are not primarily focused on the prevention and redressal of sexual harassment in the workplace.


**9.  A group of communities, historically labeled as "criminal tribes" during the British Raj, faced significant discrimination and marginalization.  Following the repeal of a specific act in 1949, these communities were officially "denotified," but continue to experience social and economic challenges. What is the name given to these communities?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes
(b)  Scheduled Tribes
(c)  Other Backward Classes
(d)  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question clearly describes communities that were historically labeled as "criminal tribes" and later "denotified." This directly refers to the Denotified Tribes (DNTs).  While some DNTs might be included in other categories (Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, or Other Backward Classes), the question focuses on the specific historical categorization and the continued challenges faced by this distinct group. The other options are broader social classifications, not directly related to the historical labeling and denotification process described.


**10. A specific category of tribal groups identified as particularly vulnerable due to their unique circumstances and socio-economic conditions receives special habitat rights under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA). What is the name given to this category of tribal groups?**

(a)  Adivasi
(b)  Janjati
(c)  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(d)  Primitive Tribal Communities


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly points to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), a specific category under the FRA that receives special provisions and habitat rights.  While terms like "Adivasi" and "Janjati" are general terms for tribal groups, the question highlights the particular vulnerability and specific legal recognition given to PVTGs.  The FRA explicitly mentions PVTGs, differentiating them from other tribal communities.  The other options are broader terms, not specific to the legal provisions mentioned in the question.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Science and Technology,  with detailed explanations:


**1.  A government initiative aims to provide pucca houses for eligible tribal households, ensuring access to clean water, electricity, and healthcare.  Which program is primarily responsible for achieving the housing component of this goal?**

(a)  PM Gram Sadak Yojana
(b)  Jal Jeevan Mission
(c)  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
(d)  Ayushman Bharat Card


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin).  The question explicitly refers to providing "pucca houses" for eligible tribal households.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin), or the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin, is a flagship scheme of the Government of India that focuses on providing affordable housing to rural poor, including tribal communities.  While Jal Jeevan Mission (clean water) and Ayushman Bharat (healthcare) are related to the overall goal of improving tribal living standards, they are not directly responsible for constructing the houses. PM Gram Sadak Yojana is for rural road connectivity.  Therefore, PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) is the most appropriate answer as it directly addresses the housing aspect mentioned in the question. The other options are incorrect because they pertain to other aspects of rural development, such as water supply, healthcare, and rural road connectivity.


**2. The establishment of Centers of Competence (CoC) in AIIMS and other premier institutes addresses a critical healthcare need in specific regions of India. What is the primary disease targeted by these CoCs?**

(a) Tuberculosis
(b) Malaria
(c) Sickle Cell Disease
(d) Dengue Fever


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) Sickle Cell Disease. The text explicitly mentions that advanced facilities for the diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) will be set up in AIIMS and other premier institutes in states where SCD is prevalent.  The other options, while significant public health concerns, are not the specific focus of the CoCs mentioned in the provided text.  The establishment of these centers highlights a targeted approach to improving healthcare infrastructure and addressing a specific genetic disorder prevalent within certain communities.  The question requires precise recall of the information provided.


**3.  A scheme aims to empower tribal producers by facilitating fair pricing, reducing post-harvest losses, and improving consumer access to tribal products. What is the name of this initiative?**

(a)  Tribal Home Stay
(b)  Sustainable Livelihood Forest Right Holders (FRA) Mission
(c)  Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC)
(d)  PM-SHRI Schools


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC).  The question describes a scheme designed to improve the market access and economic opportunities for tribal producers. The description directly matches the stated goals of the TMMC initiative.  While Tribal Home Stays aim to leverage tourism potential and the Sustainable Livelihood Forest Right Holders (FRA) Mission focuses on livelihood improvements for forest rights holders, neither directly addresses market access and price stabilization in the way the TMMC does.  PM-SHRI Schools is unrelated to tribal economic empowerment.  Understanding the specific functions of each scheme is crucial for answering this question correctly.


**4.  Which Act provides the legal framework for granting habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b)  The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996
(c)  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006
(d)  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c), the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (also known as the Forest Rights Act or FRA).  The question directly asks about the legal basis for habitat rights for PVTGs. The FRA explicitly addresses this, outlining provisions for recognizing and securing the habitat rights of these groups.  The other options deal with different aspects of tribal rights and welfare, but not the specific legal framework for habitat rights.  This question assesses factual recall of the relevant legislation and its key provisions.


**5.  A national curriculum launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development provides a structured learning framework for children aged three to six. What is the name of this curriculum?**

(a)  Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan
(b)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
(c)  Aadharshila
(d)  Mid-Day Meal Scheme


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Aadharshila.  The question clearly describes a national curriculum for early childhood care and education (ECCE) for children aged three to six years.  Aadharshila, as stated in the provided text, is the name of this curriculum.  The other options are incorrect because they pertain to different educational programs and initiatives.  Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan are related to school education, while the Mid-Day Meal Scheme is a supplementary nutrition program.  This question tests the factual recall of specific government initiatives.


**6.  The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced annually by which organization?**

(a)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
(c)  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(d)  World Bank


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) Food Security Information Network (FSIN).  The question directly asks about the annual producer of the GRFC. The text explicitly states that the GRFC is produced annually by the FSIN.  The other organizations, while involved in food security and related issues, do not produce this specific report.  This question tests the ability to accurately associate an organization with a specific publication.


**7.  Which international initiative aims to eradicate hunger and poverty, while simultaneously reducing inequalities, by mobilizing financial and knowledge resources?**

(a)  The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
(b)  The Rome Declaration on Nutrition
(c)  Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty
(d)  World Food Programme


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty. The question highlights the multi-faceted goals of the initiative: eradicating hunger and poverty, and reducing inequalities.  The description aligns perfectly with the stated aims of the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty.  The other options, while related to food security and poverty reduction, do not encompass the specific combination of goals and resource mobilization strategies mentioned in the question.  This question requires careful analysis of the stated objectives of different initiatives.


**8.  A formal mechanism used to evaluate a person's existing knowledge, skills, and experience gained through various learning pathways is known as:**

(a)  National Education Policy (NEP)
(b)  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)
(c)  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)
(d)  National Research Foundation (NRF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).  The question defines RPL's function: evaluating knowledge, skills, and experience acquired through formal, non-formal, or informal learning.  The text explicitly describes RPL and its purpose.  The other options are incorrect as they refer to broader educational policies, credit systems, or research initiatives, not the specific process of evaluating prior learning.  The question demands a precise understanding of the terminology used in educational contexts.

(a) Excellence on the Global Stage
(b) Sports for Environmental Sustainability
(c) Sports for Social Development
(d) Sports – A People’s Movement

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The draft NSP 2024 outlines five pillars focusing on global excellence, economic development through sports, social development via inclusivity and health, a people's movement engaging communities, and harmonizing with the NEP 2020.  "Sports for Environmental Sustainability" is not explicitly mentioned as a primary pillar. This question assesses conceptual understanding of the policy's framework and its key objectives, demanding a thorough understanding of the policy's structure.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and tests various cognitive skills, focusing on factual recall and conceptual understanding.  The explanations are detailed and UPSC-oriented.


**1.  A national framework was launched in 2015 by the Ministry of Education to rank educational institutions across India based on a defined methodology. This framework incorporates several parameters for assessment. Which of the following is NOT a parameter used in this framework?**

(a) Teaching, Learning, and Resources
(b) Research and Professional Practices

(d) Outreach and Inclusivity

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) uses five parameters: Teaching, Learning, and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.  Student-Teacher Ratio, while relevant to educational quality, is not explicitly one of the five core parameters used by NIRF for overall ranking.  The other options are all directly part of the NIRF evaluation criteria.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the NIRF framework.  A strong answer would accurately identify the absence of "Student-Teacher Ratio" as a primary NIRF parameter, while understanding the overall purpose and methodology of the ranking system.  This demonstrates an understanding of higher education policy in India.


**2. The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings employ a multi-faceted approach to assess universities globally.  Which of the following is NOT a key area assessed by THE rankings?**

(a) Teaching Quality
(b) Research Output
(c) Financial Stability of the Institution
(d) International Outlook

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  THE World University Rankings assess universities across five key areas: teaching, research environment, research quality, industry engagement, and international outlook.  While the financial health of an institution is indirectly relevant to its overall performance, it's not a directly assessed parameter in the THE ranking methodology. The inclusion of "Financial Stability" as a distractor highlights the need for careful reading and understanding of the specific criteria used by THE. The other options directly reflect the key pillars of THE’s assessment framework.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between directly and indirectly relevant factors in a complex evaluation system.


**3.  A significant development in India's higher education landscape involves the establishment of campuses of foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs).  Under which regulatory framework are these campuses permitted to operate in India?**

(a)  Foreign Education Regulation Act, 2022
(b)  National Education Policy, 2020 (NEP 2020) guidelines on international collaborations.
(c)  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023
(d)  Ministry of External Affairs guidelines on foreign collaborations in education.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The establishment of foreign university campuses in India is specifically governed by the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023. While NEP 2020 envisions increased internationalization of higher education, it doesn't provide the specific regulatory framework for establishing foreign campuses.  The other options are either non-existent or deal with broader aspects of international collaboration. This question tests knowledge of recent policy developments in Indian higher education and the specific regulatory instruments used to govern them.  It requires an understanding of the legal and administrative context of this significant policy change.


**4.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) aims to foster research and innovation in India. Which of the following is NOT a key initiative announced under the ANRF?**

(a) Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(b) Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(c) National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) partnerships
(d) ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The ANRF has announced PAIR, MAHA, and ACE as key initiatives.  The NSDC, while involved in skill development, is a separate organization and is not directly a part of the ANRF's core initiatives. Including "National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) partnerships" as a distractor tests the candidate's understanding of the ANRF's specific focus on research and innovation, distinguishing it from broader national development goals. The question tests factual recall and an understanding of the ANRF's mandate.

(a) SDG 1 (No Poverty)
(b) SDG 2 (Zero Hunger)
(c) SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being)
(d) SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty explicitly focuses on SDGs 1, 2, and 10.  While good health and well-being (SDG 3) is indirectly related to poverty and hunger, it's not a primary focus of this specific alliance.

(b) Household level
(c) Production level (farm-gate)
(d) Food service level

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Food Waste Index Report focuses on food waste at the retail, household, and food service levels.  While production-level (farm-gate) food loss is a significant issue, it’s tracked by a different index (Food Loss Index). The inclusion of "Production level (farm-gate)" as a distractor tests the candidate's understanding of the specific scope of the Food Waste Index Report and its relationship to other food security indicators.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the nuances in global food security reporting.


**7.  The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) assessment, launched by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, targets specific types of healthcare facilities.  Which of the following is NOT a target facility for the NQAS assessment?**

(a) Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs)
(b) Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs)
(c) Private Hospitals
(d)  Primary Health Centers (PHCs)  

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NQAS assessment targets AAMs and IPHLs, aligning with the focus on public health infrastructure. Private hospitals, while important components of the healthcare system, are not the direct target of this particular assessment initiative. The inclusion of "Private Hospitals" as a distractor tests the candidate’s awareness of the specific focus of this quality assurance program. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the Indian healthcare system's structure.


**8.  Which organization is responsible for publishing the "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report"?**

(a) World Bank
(b)  International Monetary Fund (IMF)
(c) A collaboration of five UN specialized agencies
(d)  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) alone

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report" is a joint publication of five UN specialized agencies: FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO.  Attributing it to a single agency or a non-UN organization would be incorrect.  This question tests factual recall and knowledge of international organizations involved in food security and nutrition.


**9. The  Justice Hema Committee report highlighted concerns about which issue within the Malayalam film industry?**

(a)  Wage disparities between actors and technicians
(b)  Lack of opportunities for female directors
(c)  Sexual harassment of women at the workplace
(d)  Copyright infringement and piracy


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Justice Hema Committee report specifically addressed the issue of sexual harassment of women in the Malayalam film industry.  The other options, while potentially relevant issues within the film industry, were not the primary focus of this particular committee's investigation. This question tests recall of recent events and their relevance to social issues.


**10.  GAIN, a Swiss-based NGO, focuses on addressing which global challenge?**

(a) Climate Change Mitigation
(b)  Combating Human Trafficking
(c)  Malnutrition
(d)  Promoting Digital Literacy


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) specifically targets malnutrition.  The other options represent different areas of global development but are not the core focus of GAIN's activities.  This question tests factual recall about specific NGOs and their mandates.


**1.  Regarding the financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition, which statement accurately reflects the definition presented in the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024?**

(a) It solely focuses on domestic public financial resources.
(b) It excludes private financial resources directed towards eradicating hunger.
(c) It encompasses both public and private domestic and foreign financial resources aimed at eliminating hunger, food insecurity, and all forms of malnutrition, emphasizing the availability, access, utilization, and stability of nutritious and safe foods while strengthening the resilience of agrifood systems.
(d) It primarily concentrates on foreign aid and international collaborations.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The report explicitly defines financing for food security and nutrition as encompassing both public and private financial resources, both domestic and foreign.  It's a holistic approach, not limited to a single source of funding. The definition highlights the multi-faceted nature of the problem, requiring a broad range of financial interventions to address availability, access, utilization, and stability of food, along with the crucial aspect of building resilient agrifood systems. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they present incomplete or inaccurate representations of the report's definition.  They either omit crucial elements like private funding, foreign investment, or the interconnectedness of food security and nutrition with the resilience of agrifood systems, thereby failing to capture the comprehensive nature of the definition.


**2.  Which organization is responsible for producing the annual Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)?**

(a) The World Bank
(b) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c) The Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
(d) The International Monetary Fund (IMF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Report on Food Crises is explicitly stated to be produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN).  The other options are involved in various aspects of global development and economics, but they are not the specific entity responsible for the GRFC. The FSIN's role in compiling this crucial report highlights its importance in monitoring global food security and informing policy responses to food crises.  Choosing any other option would reflect a misunderstanding of the established reporting mechanisms and the respective roles of international organizations in addressing global food security challenges.


**3. The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) aims to achieve which of the following primary objectives?**

(b)  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
(c)  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)
(d)  The Food Security Information Network (FSIN)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) perfectly matches the description.  Established under the ANRF Act 2023, it aims to cultivate a research-oriented culture in India, guided by the National Education Policy.  Its funding model involves a substantial contribution from the central government (₹14,000 crore) supplemented by a significant amount from private sources (₹36,000 crore).

(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Maharashtra

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and union territories in India, with 13 such groups. This is based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Committee. The question tests factual recall of specific geographical information related to the distribution of vulnerable tribal groups and their legal protections under Indian law, requiring knowledge beyond general awareness of tribal populations.

**8.  The National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates, released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, provide a comprehensive overview of India's health financing system. Which entity is responsible for preparing these estimates?**

(a)  The National Board of Accreditation (NBA)
(b)  The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS)
(c)  The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d)  The Food Security Information Network (FSIN)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) is responsible for preparing the NHA estimates under the guidance of the NHA Steering Committee and the NHA Expert Group for India. The question tests factual recall of the institutional arrangements for data generation and analysis within the Indian healthcare system.  It distinguishes between different organizations involved in health-related data collection and reporting.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring a nuanced understanding of the information.


**1.  A government initiative aims to enhance the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood.  Which of the following accurately describes this initiative?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, focusing on maternal health and nutrition.
(b)  National Food Security Act, 2013, guaranteeing the right to food.
(c)  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), a multi-pronged approach to tribal development.
(d)  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, concentrating on the most vulnerable tribal groups.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the description directly matches the goals and features of the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA).  This scheme explicitly aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in various sectors.  Options (a) and (d), while related to tribal welfare, are narrower in scope.  (a) focuses solely on maternal health, while (d) targets only Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). Option (b) focuses on food security, which is one component of PM-JUGA but not the overarching goal.  PM-JUGA's comprehensive approach, encompassing infrastructure development, skill building, and livelihood enhancement, distinguishes it from the other options.  The multi-ministerial involvement and the five-year tenure further highlight its comprehensive nature.

(a) Juangs and Mankidia tribes:  Recognized as PVTGs and granted habitat rights in Odisha.
(b)  Bharias: A Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Madhya Pradesh.
(c)  Denotified Tribes (DNTs):  Historically labeled as "born criminals" during the British Raj and facing persistent discrimination.
(d)  Pardis and Gujjars: Primarily agricultural communities focused on rice cultivation and wheat farming.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is incorrect. While Pardis and Gujjars are nomadic or semi-nomadic communities, the text specifies that they are primarily pastoral communities (involved in animal husbandry), not agricultural communities focused on rice and wheat. The other options accurately reflect the characteristics and activities of the respective groups as described in the text.  The details regarding habitat rights for Juangs and Mankidia, the PVTG status of Bharias, and the historical context of DNTs are all correctly stated.  Therefore, the discrepancy in the description of Pardis and Gujjars makes (d) the correct answer.

(a) Depletion of freshwater resources due to excessive irrigation for food production.
(b) Loss of biodiversity due to the destruction of habitats for agriculture.
(c)  Significant contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions.
(d)  Increased soil erosion and degradation from unsustainable farming practices.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The Food Waste Index Report 2024 explicitly states that food waste generates an estimated 8–10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  While options (a), (b), and (d) are valid environmental concerns related to food production and consumption, they are not the primary impact highlighted in the specific report. The report directly links food waste to greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing its significant contribution to climate change. This makes option (c) the most accurate and relevant answer based on the provided information.

(a)  A shift from a qualitative assessment to a purely quantitative ranking system.
(b)  The inclusion of international universities in the ranking process.
(c) The addition of new ranking categories, such as Open Universities and Skill Universities.
(d)  A change in the weighting of the five core parameters used for evaluation.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The text explicitly mentions that NIRF 2024 added new categories for ranking: Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities. This expansion of categories represents a significant change to the framework. Options (a), (b), and (d) are not supported by the provided text.  There is no mention of a shift to a purely quantitative system, the inclusion of international universities is not directly related to NIRF, and no change in the weighting of parameters is detailed.  Therefore, the addition of new categories is the most accurate description of the change.


**5.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) focuses on a specific objective. Which of the following statements best captures this objective?**

(a)  To provide financial assistance and social security to individuals with disabilities.
(b)  To promote the integration of individuals with disabilities into mainstream employment.
(c) To promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.
(d) To establish specialized educational institutions for children with disabilities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text clearly states that the objective of the UN-CRPD is "To promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities."  This encompasses a broad range of rights and freedoms, going beyond the specific areas mentioned in options (a), (b), and (d).  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent aspects of disability inclusion but do not fully capture the comprehensive aim of the UN-CRPD, which emphasizes the full realization of all human rights for persons with disabilities.  Therefore, option (c) is the most accurate and complete representation of the convention's objective.


**1.  Considering the information on the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, which statement accurately reflects India's standing and challenges?**

(a) India's GHI score improved significantly in 2024, indicating a substantial reduction in hunger levels.
(b)  India ranked among the top 25 countries globally in the GHI 2024, demonstrating effective hunger mitigation strategies.
(c)  Despite improvement since 2000, India's GHI score remains in the "serious" category, with high rates of child wasting and stunting.
(d) The GHI report for India showcased negligible malnutrition issues among children under five years of age.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately reflects the key findings of the GHI 2024 report regarding India.  The report indicated that while India's GHI score has improved since 2000, it still falls under the "serious" category, highlighting the persistent challenge of hunger and malnutrition.  The report specifically pointed out the alarmingly high rates of child wasting (over 18.7%) and stunting (over 35.5%) among children under five. This persistent challenge underscores the need for continued and strengthened interventions to address these critical nutritional deficiencies. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they contradict the report's findings.  Option (a) is false because while there was improvement, it wasn't significant enough to move India out of the "serious" category. Option (b) is incorrect because India ranked 105th out of 127 countries, far from the top 25. Option (d) is incorrect because the report explicitly stated that child wasting and stunting remain very high.  The persistent high rates of malnutrition in children highlight the complex interplay of factors contributing to food insecurity in India, including poverty, inequitable access to resources, and the impact of climate change.


**2. Which organization is responsible for the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), a key indicator within SDG 12.3?**

(a) The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(b) The World Food Programme (WFP)
(c) The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(d)  Concern Worldwide


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), as explicitly stated in the provided text.  The FLI is one of two indicators under SDG 12.3, focusing on reducing food losses along production and supply chains.  The FAO's role as custodian involves data collection, analysis, and reporting on food loss, providing crucial information for policy-making and interventions to minimize food waste. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. While UNEP is involved in tracking food waste at the retail and consumer levels (FWI), it is not responsible for the FLI.  The WFP plays a crucial role in food assistance, but it is not the custodian of the FLI. Concern Worldwide is a non-governmental organization involved in hunger relief efforts but does not have a direct role in the custodian of the FLI.  The FAO's expertise in agriculture and food systems makes it the most appropriate organization to oversee the FLI, ensuring consistent data collection and analysis to inform global efforts to reduce food loss.


**3.  The "Spot Food License Initiative," launched by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, primarily aims to:**

(a)  Improve the quality of food served in government hospitals.
(b) Simplify and expedite the process of issuing food licenses and registrations.
(c)  Increase the price of food items to ensure higher quality.
(d)  Restrict the number of food licenses issued nationally.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Spot Food License Initiative aims to streamline and accelerate the issuance of food licenses and registrations using a pan-India IT platform called FoSCoS.  This initiative directly addresses bureaucratic hurdles and delays often associated with obtaining food licenses, making the process more efficient and accessible for businesses.  The initiative contributes to the overall goal of promoting "Healthcare for All" by ensuring a smoother regulatory environment for food businesses. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. While the initiative indirectly supports food safety and quality, its primary goal isn't directly about improving food quality in government hospitals (a).  The initiative doesn't aim to increase food prices (c) or restrict the number of licenses (d); it aims to make the licensing process more efficient.  The focus on simplification and speed, facilitated by technology, is a key characteristic of the initiative, aligning with broader government efforts to improve ease of doing business.


**4.  The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) recently released a report emphasizing the importance of:**

(a) Reducing the consumption of processed foods to improve public health.
(b) Investing in nutritious food value chains to reduce gender inequalities and enhance business resilience.
(c) Increasing the price of nutritious food to discourage overconsumption.
(d) Promoting traditional farming practices to improve food security.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GAIN's report highlighted the crucial role of investments in nutritious food value chains in achieving multiple positive outcomes.  The report directly linked investments in this sector to reducing gender inequalities, boosting productivity within the agri-food sector, and enhancing the resilience of businesses operating in this domain.  By focusing on value chains, the report emphasizes the need for holistic interventions that address various aspects of food production, processing, distribution, and consumption. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. While reducing processed food consumption (a) is important for health, it's not the central theme of GAIN's report.  Increasing the price of nutritious food (c) is counterproductive to improving nutrition access. Promoting traditional farming practices (d) might be beneficial in some contexts, but GAIN's report focuses on a broader, more systemic approach to improving nutrition through value chain investments.  The interconnectedness of gender equality, economic development, and nutrition security is a key takeaway from GAIN's report, illustrating the multifaceted nature of addressing malnutrition effectively.

(a)  Improving agricultural productivity to increase food availability.
(b)  Strengthening food distribution networks to enhance access to food.
(c) Financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition in all its forms.
(d)  Promoting sustainable agricultural practices to protect the environment.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, explicitly focuses on financing as the central theme for ending hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition in all forms. The report defines financing broadly, encompassing both public and private resources, domestic and foreign, directed towards eradicating hunger and all forms of malnutrition. This focus on financing highlights the crucial role of resource allocation in addressing the complex challenge of food insecurity. Options (a), (b), and (d) are important aspects of food security, but they are not the primary focus of the report's theme.  While improved agricultural productivity (a), robust distribution networks (b), and sustainable agricultural practices (d) are all essential components of achieving food security, the report emphasizes the critical need for adequate and targeted financing to make progress towards SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). The report's emphasis on financing reflects the understanding that effective solutions require substantial investments across various sectors and stakeholders.

(a) The World Bank, UNICEF, and the World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) The European Union, the FAO, and the WFP
(c)  GAIN, IFPRI, and the UNHRC
(d)  Concern Worldwide, Welthungerhilfe, and the UNDP


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GNAFC was launched by the European Union, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Food Programme (WFP) at the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016.  These three entities represent a powerful combination of political will (EU), technical expertise in agriculture and food systems (FAO), and experience in food assistance and humanitarian response (WFP). Their collaboration reflects a recognition of the multifaceted nature of food crises and the need for a coordinated global effort to address their root causes. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. While these organizations are involved in various aspects of food security and humanitarian assistance, they were not the founding partners of the GNAFC.  The specific combination of the EU, FAO, and WFP in establishing the GNAFC reflects a strategic approach to tackling food crises, combining political commitment, technical knowledge, and logistical capacity for effective humanitarian intervention.


**7.  Which of the following initiatives is NOT directly associated with addressing hunger and malnutrition in India?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)
(b) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(c) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(d) Project NAMAN


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Project NAMAN, focused on providing support to defense pensioners and veterans, is not directly related to addressing hunger and malnutrition in India.  The other options—PMGKAY, PMMVY, and Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0—are all government initiatives specifically designed to tackle hunger and malnutrition through food security programs, nutritional support for mothers and children, and supplementary nutrition programs.  Project NAMAN's objective is distinct from these initiatives, focusing on welfare for a specific segment of the population.  The other three initiatives directly address nutritional needs and food security, reflecting the Indian government's commitment to improving the nutritional status of vulnerable populations.  The contrast highlights the different but equally important social welfare objectives undertaken by the government.


**8. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 was jointly launched by which two organizations?**

(a) FAO and WFP
(b) UNDP and UNICEF
(c) UNEP and WRAP
(d) GAIN and IFPRI


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 was a collaborative effort between the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme).  This partnership combines UNEP's global environmental focus and WRAP's expertise in waste management and resource efficiency.  The joint launch reflects the understanding that food waste is both an environmental and a social issue, requiring a multi-pronged approach to address its significant consequences. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.  While the organizations listed in these options are involved in various aspects of food security and sustainable development, they were not the partners who launched the Food Waste Index Report 2024. The collaboration between UNEP and WRAP highlights the growing recognition of the interconnectedness of environmental sustainability and food security.


**9.  The Rome Declaration on Nutrition commits countries to eradicating which global issues?**

(a)  Water scarcity and sanitation challenges.
(b)  Climate change and biodiversity loss.
(c)  Hunger and all forms of malnutrition worldwide, especially undernutrition in children and anemia in women and children.
(d)  Poverty and lack of educational opportunities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rome Declaration on Nutrition is specifically focused on eradicating hunger and preventing all forms of malnutrition globally, with a particular emphasis on undernutrition in children and anemia in women and children.  This targeted approach recognizes the disproportionate impact of malnutrition on vulnerable populations and the critical need for interventions to address these specific nutritional deficiencies. Options (a), (b), and (d) are important global challenges, but they are not the central focus of the Rome Declaration on Nutrition.  The declaration's targeted focus on hunger and malnutrition showcases the importance of prioritizing nutritional needs for overall health and well-being, particularly among vulnerable groups.  The declaration's emphasis on children and women reflects a broader understanding of the intergenerational impact of malnutrition.


**10.  Which of the following is NOT a key dimension used in the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)?**

(a)  Educational Attainment
(b)  Economic Participation and Opportunity
(c)  Political Empowerment
(d)  Food Security


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) uses three key dimensions: Educational Attainment, Economic Participation and Opportunity, and Political Empowerment.  Food security, while crucial for overall well-being, is not explicitly included as a primary dimension in the GGGI's assessment of gender parity.  The GGGI focuses on the disparities between genders in access to education, economic resources, and political representation.  The exclusion of food security as a primary dimension doesn't diminish its importance but reflects the GGGI's specific focus on gender-related gaps in education, economy, and politics.  While food security is related to social well-being and can disproportionately affect women, the GGGI's framework uses a different set of dimensions for its assessment of gender equality.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content,  adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.


**1.  A government initiative aims to comprehensively develop Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) while preserving their cultural heritage.  Which scheme best aligns with this objective?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(c)  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013
(d)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) explicitly aims at the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs while emphasizing the preservation of their culture and heritage.  Options (a), (c), and (d) address housing, food security, and education respectively, but lack the specific focus on the holistic development and cultural preservation of PVTGs that is central to PM-JUGA.  PM-JUGA's design incorporates various schemes to achieve this goal, demonstrating its comprehensive approach.  The other options, while beneficial to tribal communities, are not as directly targeted towards the multifaceted needs and cultural sensitivity of PVTGs as PM-JUGA.


**2. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) grants a specific type of right to certain tribal communities, enabling them to utilize customary habitats within reserved and protected forests.  What is the name of this right?**

(a)  Land Ownership Rights
(b)  Grazing Rights
(c)  Habitat Rights
(d)  Forest Produce Collection Rights


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FRA, in Section 3(1)(e), specifically outlines "habitat rights" for primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes. These rights grant access to and use of their customary habitats within reserved and protected forests. While the FRA also addresses land ownership, grazing, and forest produce collection rights (options a, b, and d), the question specifically points to the right related to customary habitats, making "habitat rights" the most accurate and precise answer. The other options are related to the FRA but don't directly address the core issue of customary habitat use.


**3.  Several states in India have a significant population of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). According to the 2001 census, which three states had the highest concentration of PVTGs?**

(a) Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
(b) Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra
(c) Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal
(d) Assam, Tripura, Mizoram


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra had the highest concentration of PVTGs based on the 2001 census data.  The other options present states with notable tribal populations, but they are not the top three as identified by the 2001 census data.  This question tests factual recall of specific data related to PVTG distribution across Indian states. The precision of the question and the specific data demanded make this question challenging and suitable for a UPSC-level examination.


**4.  Which organization is the custodian of the Food Waste Index (FWI), a key indicator for tracking global food waste at retail and consumer levels?**

(a)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(b)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(c)  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(d)  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is the custodian of the Food Waste Index (FWI).  The FAO, WFP, and IFPRI are all involved in food security and related issues but are not responsible for the FWI. This question tests factual recall of the organization responsible for a specific index related to food waste.  The correct answer is clearly stated in the provided text, making other options easily eliminable.


**5.  The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Which of the following is NOT a stated goal of this mission?**

(a)  Ensuring all-weather road connectivity to ST-majority villages.
(b)  Providing access to quality health facilities to ST households.
(c)  Promoting the cultivation of genetically modified crops in tribal areas.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PM-JUGA mission's goals focus on infrastructure development, healthcare, education, and livelihood improvement for tribal communities. While the mission aims to improve agricultural practices, it does not explicitly mention the promotion of genetically modified crops.  The other options are directly stated goals of the PM-JUGA. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the mission's goals and the ability to identify what is not included within the scope of the mission. The inclusion of a plausible distractor (option c) makes the question more challenging.


**6.  A Supreme Court case, Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others, highlighted caste-based discrimination within prisons.  Which specific group is particularly vulnerable to this discrimination, as discussed in the case?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b)  Other Backward Castes (OBCs)
(c)  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)
(d)  Scheduled Tribes (STs)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sukanya Santha case specifically addresses the persistent caste-based discrimination against Denotified Tribes (DNTs) within prisons. While other marginalized groups also face discrimination, the case explicitly highlights the vulnerability of DNTs to this issue within the prison system.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of a specific Supreme Court case and its implications for a particular marginalized group.  The specific naming of the case and the vulnerable group makes this question challenging and relevant for UPSC preparation.

(a)  The Mandal Commission
(b)  The Sarkaria Commission
(c)  The Dhebar Committee
(d)  The Kakodkar Committee


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that the government's recognition of 75 PVTGs is based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Committee (1960-61).  The other options represent committees that addressed different issues related to Indian society and administration, making them incorrect in this context.  This question tests factual recall of a specific committee's role in defining a crucial categorization of tribal groups in India.  The specific naming of the committee makes the question challenging and tests precise knowledge.



These questions are designed to challenge candidates' understanding of the provided material and require a high level of factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  They are intended to be difficult, forcing candidates to engage deeply with the content.


**1.  A global report highlights that one in eleven individuals globally faced hunger in 2023.  Which organization is primarily responsible for compiling and releasing this annual report on global food crises?**

(a) World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c) Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
(d)  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC). The GNAFC, a collaborative effort launched in 2016 by the European Union, the FAO, and the World Food Programme (WFP), releases the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) annually.  While the FAO, WFP, and other UN agencies contribute data and analysis, the GNAFC is the coordinating body responsible for the report's publication and dissemination. Option (a) is incorrect because the WHO focuses primarily on health issues, not food security. Option (b) is incorrect as the UNDP's work is broader, encompassing development issues, not solely food crises.  Option (d), while involved in the GNAFC, is not the primary body responsible for releasing the GRFC. The GNAFC's role in coordinating the report and its focus on food crises make it the most appropriate answer.  Understanding the roles of different UN agencies is crucial for comprehending global challenges like food insecurity.


**2.  The 2024 Global Gender Gap Report, released by a prominent international organization, reveals a significant disparity in gender parity across various dimensions. Which of the following countries consistently ranks among the top three globally in this report?**

(a) United States
(b) India
(c) Norway
(d) China


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) Norway.  The World Economic Forum (WEF) publishes the Global Gender Gap Report, and Norway consistently features among the top three countries globally, demonstrating high levels of gender parity across economic participation, educational attainment, political empowerment, and health. The other options are incorrect. The United States, while striving for gender equality, does not consistently rank among the top three. India's ranking is considerably lower due to persistent gender inequalities. China, while making progress, also doesn't typically achieve a top-three ranking in the Global Gender Gap Report. This question tests knowledge of global gender equality indices and the consistent performance of specific nations. The WEF's report is a significant benchmark for assessing progress towards gender parity worldwide.


**3.  A significant initiative, launched in Davos 2024, aims to foster global cooperation in promoting gender equity and equality. This initiative, endorsed by a major international forum, brings together governments, industry, and development organizations. Which organization serves as a "Network Partner" in this initiative?**

(a)  The United Nations
(b)  The World Bank
(c)  The World Economic Forum (WEF)
(d)  The International Monetary Fund (IMF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) The World Economic Forum (WEF). The "Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality" was launched in Davos 2024 and endorsed by the WEF. The WEF acts as a "Network Partner" in this initiative, facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration among its diverse members. The other options are incorrect. While the UN, World Bank, and IMF are involved in various development and gender equality initiatives, they are not the "Network Partner" specifically for the Alliance for Global Good. This question assesses understanding of recent global initiatives focused on gender equality and the roles of various international organizations in fostering such collaborations.  Recognizing the WEF's influence in shaping global dialogues on such issues is crucial.


**4.  India's performance in a specific global ranking in 2022 placed it at 108th out of 193 countries. This ranking assesses the extent of gender inequality across various societal dimensions. Which report or index provides this ranking?**

(a) Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)
(b) Gender Inequality Index (GII)
(c) Human Development Index (HDI)
(d)  Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) Gender Inequality Index (GII). The GII, published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), provides a composite measure of gender inequality across three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity. India's ranking of 108th out of 193 countries in 2022 reflects its performance on these indicators. Option (a) is incorrect; while the GGGI also measures gender inequality, it is published by the WEF and uses a different methodology. Option (c) is incorrect; the HDI is a broader measure of human development, not specifically focused on gender inequality. Option (d) is incorrect; the MPI measures poverty across multiple dimensions, not specifically gender inequality.  Understanding the nuances of different indices used to measure gender inequality is crucial for analyzing development progress. The GII is a key tool for understanding the multifaceted nature of gender inequality.

**Explanation:**

Both (b) and (c) are correct.  The Aruna Shanbaug case (2011) was a pivotal moment, where the Supreme Court of India, for the first time, recognized the legality of passive euthanasia under strict guidelines. This was further solidified by the Common Cause vs. Union of India & Anr. (2018) case, which reaffirmed the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right under Article 21 and upheld the legal validity of passive euthanasia. The Vishaka case dealt with sexual harassment, while the Justice J.S. Verma Committee focused on criminal law reforms, neither directly addressing euthanasia.  The significance of these two cases lies in their establishment of a legal framework for passive euthanasia, allowing individuals to refuse life-sustaining treatment under specific circumstances.  This reflects a crucial intersection of legal and medical ethics in modern India.  The ruling underscores the importance of respecting individual autonomy and the right to a dignified death, even when it involves foregoing life-sustaining treatment.  The Supreme Court's careful consideration of the ethical and legal implications in these cases sets a precedent for future considerations of end-of-life care.

**2.  Recent guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare pertain to a crucial aspect of end-of-life care.  What specific procedure is detailed in these guidelines?**

(a) Active euthanasia protocols
(b)  Advance directives for organ donation
(c)  Withdrawal of life support in terminally ill patients (Passive Euthanasia)
(d)  Palliative care standards

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare released draft guidelines specifically addressing the withdrawal of life support in terminally ill patients, which is essentially passive euthanasia.  The guidelines detail procedures for determining terminal illness, the conditions for withdrawing life-sustaining treatments, and the constitution of medical boards to oversee the process. Options (a), (b), and (d) are related to healthcare but not the direct focus of these specific guidelines. Active euthanasia, the deliberate act of ending a life, remains illegal in India.  While advance directives can cover various medical decisions, the focus here is on withdrawing life support, not organ donation.  Palliative care, while relevant to end-of-life care, is not the primary subject of these particular guidelines.  The importance of these guidelines lies in providing a structured framework for a complex and sensitive medical and ethical issue, ensuring compliance with Supreme Court directives and offering clarity to medical professionals and families dealing with terminally ill patients.

**3. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) report highlights a concerning global trend.  Which of the following is a key finding of the GHI 2024 report?**

(a)  Significant improvement in global hunger levels since 2000
(b)  Hunger levels in most countries are improving steadily
(c) The goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 is attainable with current progress
(d)  Hunger levels in numerous countries remain alarming, jeopardizing the 2030 goal.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2024 report explicitly states that hunger levels in 42 countries are at alarming levels, making the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 unattainable with the current rate of progress.  Options (a), (b), and (c) contradict this core finding.  The report does not indicate significant overall improvement since 2000, nor does it suggest a steadily improving trend across most countries. The report's stark warning underscores the need for intensified global efforts to address hunger and malnutrition.  The report’s findings are not only a measure of food security but also reflect broader societal challenges such as gender inequality and the impact of climate change.  Understanding the complexities highlighted by the GHI is crucial for formulating effective policies to combat hunger.

**4.  A significant initiative aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India. What is the name of this scheme, launched by the Prime Minister?**

(a) PM-Kisan
(b)  PM-Awas Yojana
(c)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(d)  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is a scheme specifically designed to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India.  The scheme focuses on addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence and outreach of various existing schemes. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all important government schemes but address different aspects of development. PM-Kisan focuses on farmer income support, PM-Awas Yojana on housing, and NREGA on rural employment.  The significance of PM-JUGA lies in its holistic approach to tribal development, aiming to achieve a more comprehensive and sustainable improvement in their lives.  The program's name itself reflects a direct connection to the historical struggles and aspirations of the tribal communities.


**5.  The 77th annual World Health Assembly resulted in significant changes to a key international health framework. What framework was amended?**

(a)  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(b)  The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005
(c)  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
(d)  The Geneva Convention

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 77th World Health Assembly concluded with an agreement on crucial amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005. These amendments aim to strengthen global preparedness and response mechanisms for public health emergencies, learning from past experiences like the Ebola and COVID-19 pandemics. The other options are unrelated to the specific outcome of the 77th WHA.  The amendments to the IHR demonstrate a commitment to enhancing global cooperation and improving the effectiveness of international health regulations.  The changes made reflect the need for a more robust and adaptable framework to address future public health challenges.  The amendments emphasize coordination, funding, and improved national capacities for responding to health emergencies.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Science and Technology,  with detailed explanations.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test various cognitive skills.


**1.  A significant initiative under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) aims to bridge the research gap between nascent and established institutions. This initiative, operating on a "hub and spoke" model, focuses on mentorship and collaborative research. Which of the following initiatives best fits this description?**

(a)  Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(b)  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)
(c)  Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(d)  None of the above

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) initiative explicitly aims to pair universities with less developed research capabilities ("nascent stage") with established, high-performing institutions.  This mentorship model, operating on a hub-and-spoke structure (where established institutions act as hubs and less developed ones as spokes), is designed to accelerate innovation and research in the partnered universities.  MAHA focuses on supporting research in specific high-impact areas but doesn't inherently involve the mentorship aspect described in the question.  ACE focuses on creating world-class research centers. Therefore, PAIR is the only option that accurately reflects the description provided.


**2. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) has a specific objective related to the rights of individuals with disabilities.  Which of the following BEST encapsulates this objective?**

(a) To ensure specialized educational programs for persons with disabilities.
(b) To provide financial assistance to families of persons with disabilities.
(c) To promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.
(d) To establish quotas for employment of persons with disabilities in the public sector.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD's core objective is the comprehensive promotion, protection, and guarantee of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for people with disabilities.  This goes beyond specific initiatives like education or financial aid (options a and b).  While employment quotas (option d) might be a related policy outcome in some countries, it isn't the primary, overarching objective of the convention. The convention aims for full and equal rights and freedoms, not just targeted programs or quotas.


**3.  A crucial aspect of the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) involves the convergence of various schemes to address the socio-economic needs of tribal communities.  Which of the following BEST describes the funding mechanism for this ambitious program?**

(a)  Dedicated, newly allocated funds from the national budget.
(b)  International aid and grants from foreign governments.
(c)  Funds reallocated from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.
(d)  Private sector investment and corporate social responsibility initiatives.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA leverages existing resources rather than creating new funding streams. Its budget is drawn from the pre-existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, utilizing funds already allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  This approach highlights resource optimization and efficient utilization of existing governmental funds. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they describe funding sources not utilized by PM-JUGA.


**4.  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme has a primary goal. Which of the following statements accurately reflects that goal?**

(a) To assimilate PVTGs into mainstream society, erasing their unique cultural identities.
(b) To provide exclusively financial assistance for PVTGs without considering cultural preservation.
(c) To achieve comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs while preserving their culture and heritage.
(d) To relocate PVTGs to urban areas for better access to education and employment.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The core objective of the 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is holistic socio-economic progress for these groups while simultaneously safeguarding their cultural identity and heritage.  Options (a) and (d) propose approaches that are directly contradictory to the scheme's stated goals.  Option (b) is incorrect because the scheme includes programs beyond purely financial assistance.  The scheme emphasizes a balanced approach, ensuring economic improvement without compromising cultural preservation.


**5.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) utilizes several key parameters for ranking educational institutions.  Which of the following is NOT a parameter used in the NIRF ranking system?**

(a) Teaching, Learning, and Resources
(b) Research and Professional Practices
(c)  Student Satisfaction Surveys
(d)  Graduation Outcomes

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While student feedback is undoubtedly important, NIRF explicitly lists Teaching, Learning, and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception as its core parameters.  Student satisfaction surveys, while potentially informing some aspects of these parameters, are not explicitly listed as an independent ranking criterion.  The other options are all core parameters used in the NIRF ranking methodology.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  Each question is designed to be challenging and avoids obvious or easily guessable answers.


**1.  A national initiative aims to comprehensively improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities across India by addressing critical gaps in infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood. This initiative utilizes existing funds and involves multiple ministries. Which of the following accurately identifies this initiative?**

(a)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(c)  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is explicitly designed to address the socio-economic needs of tribal communities through a multi-pronged approach involving infrastructure development, healthcare improvements, educational access, and livelihood enhancements.  It leverages existing funds from the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) and involves the collaborative efforts of multiple line ministries.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are all significant government schemes but do not encompass the comprehensive, multi-ministry, and existing-funds-based approach central to PM-JUGA. Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan focuses on education, NFSA on food security, and PMAY-G on rural housing, respectively.


**2.  The 2024 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report revealed concerning trends in global hunger levels. Which of the following statements accurately reflects a key finding of this report regarding India's situation?**

(a) India's GHI score improved significantly, indicating substantial progress in combating hunger.
(b) India's ranking improved, but challenges related to child wasting and stunting persist.
(c)  India achieved a "low" hunger severity level, exceeding global targets.
(d) The report found no significant correlation between gender inequality and hunger in India.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 GHI report indicated that while India's ranking improved compared to the previous year, it still falls under the "serious" category of hunger severity.  The report highlighted persistent challenges related to child wasting and stunting, indicating significant room for improvement despite the ranking increase.  Options (a) and (c) misrepresent the report's findings, while option (d) is incorrect because the report clearly highlights the link between gender inequality and hunger as a global and Indian concern.


**3.  A significant legal judgment addressed caste-based discrimination within prisons, particularly affecting Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and "habitual offenders." This ruling struck down specific provisions of prison manuals deemed unconstitutional. Which of the following best describes the core issue addressed by this judgment?**

(a)  Lack of access to education for DNTs within prison systems.
(b)  Inadequate healthcare facilities for DNTs in prisons.
(c)  Caste-based segregation and discriminatory labor allocation within prisons.
(d)  Insufficient legal representation for DNTs facing criminal charges.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court case, referenced in the text, specifically focused on the unconstitutional nature of caste-based discrimination within prison walls.  This included the segregation of barracks, the assignment of manual labor based on caste, and other provisions that disproportionately disadvantaged DNTs and "habitual offenders." While options (a), (b), and (d) might represent related challenges faced by DNTs, they are not the central focus of the mentioned legal judgment.  The judgment directly addressed the systemic caste-based discrimination within the prison system itself.


**4. A new national curriculum for early childhood care and education (ECCE) has been launched in India, aiming to provide a structured learning framework for young children. What is the name of this curriculum and the age group it targets?**

(a)  Poshan 2.0, targeting children aged 0-3 years.
(b)  Aadharshila, targeting children aged 3-6 years.
(c)  Skill India Mission, targeting children aged 6-10 years.
(d)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, targeting children aged 10-14 years.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) launched "Aadharshila," a National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) for children aged three to six years. The other options are incorrect; Poshan 2.0 focuses on nutrition, Skill India Mission on skill development, and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan on school education, targeting different age groups.


**5. Which international convention aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities?**

(a)  The Biwako Millennium Framework
(b)  The Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region
(c)  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)
(d)  Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is the primary international legal instrument specifically designed to protect and promote the rights of persons with disabilities. While the other options address related issues, only the UN-CRPD focuses directly on the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by persons with disabilities.  The Biwako Millennium Framework and the Declaration on Full Participation are supporting documents or regional initiatives, not the main international convention.  The Alliance for Global Good addresses gender equity, not specifically disability rights.


**6. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) of India grants specific rights related to forest-dwelling communities. What specific right is central to the FRA, as defined in the provided text?**

(a) The right to free and compulsory education.
(b) The right to participate in forest governance.
(c) Habitat rights, encompassing customary and other habitats within reserved and protected forests.
(d) The right to access government welfare schemes.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the FRA defines "habitat" and grants "Habitat Rights" to specific tribal groups, encompassing customary habitats and other habitats within reserved and protected forests. While the FRA also touches upon other rights related to forest dwellers, the core right emphasized in the given text is the right to their habitat.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are not the primary focus of the definition of rights provided in the given text excerpt.

(a)  Funding is primarily sourced from international aid organizations.
(b)  Funding is provided through a 50/50 partnership between the central and state governments.
(c)  Funding is entirely provided by state governments.
(d)  Funding is provided through 100% central assistance in the form of grants and capital asset creation.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme receives 100% central assistance, provided as grants and for the creation of capital assets. This clarifies that the funding is entirely from the central government. The other options are incorrect and do not reflect the funding mechanism described.


**9. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in India recently released its latest rankings. Which of the following is a new addition to the categories ranked by NIRF in 2024?**

(a)  Central Universities
(b)  Private Engineering Colleges

**10.  The Renke Commission (2008) provided insights into a specific group of people in India.  Which of the following best describes the focus of this commission's findings?**

(a)  The socio-economic status of Scheduled Castes (SCs) in urban areas.
(b)  The educational attainment of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in rural areas.
(c)  The number and characteristics of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in India.
(d)  The healthcare access of Other Backward Castes (OBCs) in remote regions.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text directly states that the Renke Commission (2008) reported on the approximate number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs in India, along with their composition. The other options are not directly related to the commission's focus as mentioned in the excerpt.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Science and Technology,  with detailed explanations:

(d)  The North American Union


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the Biwako Millennium Framework and the Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities.  These initiatives are explicitly linked to the Asia-Pacific region. The other options are incorrect because these frameworks are not directly associated with those regional organizations.  The Biwako Millennium Framework's focus on inclusive and barrier-free societies aligns directly with the goals of promoting the rights and participation of people with disabilities in the Asia-Pacific region.  Understanding the geographical context of such international frameworks is crucial for comprehending their implementation and impact. The specific mention of the Asia-Pacific region in the provided text makes (c) the only correct answer.


**2. The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is a socio-economic development scheme focused on a particular segment of the Indian population. Which of the following best describes the target beneficiaries of this scheme?**

(a)  Urban slum dwellers
(b)  Marginalized farmers
(c)  Tribal communities
(d)  Rural women


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** PM-JUGA explicitly aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India. The name itself, incorporating "Janjatiya" (tribal), makes this clear.  The scheme's objectives, focusing on infrastructure development, healthcare, education, and livelihood enhancement, are all targeted towards addressing the specific challenges faced by tribal populations. While other marginalized groups may benefit indirectly from some aspects of the scheme, the primary and explicit focus is on tribal communities. Options (a), (b), and (d) represent different segments of the population but are not the primary focus of PM-JUGA.


**3.  A National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), launched in 2024, is based on a specific philosophical framework. Which of the following concepts underpins this curriculum's structure and approach?**

(a)  Cognitive Development Theory
(b)  Constructivist Learning Theory
(c)  Panchakosha Concept
(d)  Behaviorist Learning Theory


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "Aadharshila" curriculum explicitly mentions being based on the Panchakosha concept, which encompasses physical, life energy, emotional/mental, intellectual, and spiritual development. This holistic approach to early childhood development is central to the curriculum's design.  While other learning theories might inform specific aspects of the curriculum, the Panchakosha framework is explicitly stated as the foundational principle.  Understanding this underlying philosophy is key to understanding the curriculum's overall approach to early childhood care and education.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent different learning theories, but they are not the explicit foundation of the Aadharshila curriculum.

(c)  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)
(d)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The ANRF's initiatives are PAIR, MAHA, and ACE. The NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) is a separate initiative under the Ministry of Education, aimed at ranking educational institutions.  While both ANRF and NIRF contribute to the overall goal of improving India's education and research landscape, they are distinct entities with different functions. The question assesses the understanding of the specific initiatives launched by the ANRF, and recognizing that NIRF is not among them. Therefore, (d) is the correct answer.


**5.  A recent Supreme Court judgment highlighted issues of caste-based discrimination within a specific institutional setting. Which of the following best describes the setting addressed in this judgment?**

(a)  Educational institutions
(b)  Healthcare facilities
(c)  Prisons
(d)  Workplace environments


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others case specifically addressed caste-based discrimination within prisons. The judgment highlighted issues such as segregation of barracks, division of manual labor, and discriminatory provisions against Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and “habitual offenders.” While caste-based discrimination can exist in other settings, this particular judgment focused on the prison system.  The details provided in the text pinpoint prisons as the specific context of the Supreme Court's ruling. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent different institutional contexts where caste-based discrimination might occur, but not the specific focus of this Supreme Court judgment.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions may lean more towards factual recall than other cognitive skills, but they aim for a higher difficulty level through precise wording and plausible distractors.


**1.  A global report highlights the critical need for increased financial resources to combat global hunger and malnutrition.  Which organization is primarily responsible for producing the annual report assessing the severity of food crises worldwide?**

(a) The World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
(c) The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(d) Concern Worldwide


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), a collaborative effort involving the European Union, FAO, and WFP, launches the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) annually.  While the WHO, UNEP, and Concern Worldwide are involved in various aspects of food security and nutrition, the GRFC is specifically the responsibility of the GNAFC.  The question tests factual recall of the organization responsible for a specific report. Option (a) is incorrect because the WHO’s focus is broader public health, not specifically food crisis reporting. Option (c) is incorrect because UNEP focuses on environmental aspects related to food waste, not the overall food crisis assessment. Option (d) is incorrect because Concern Worldwide is a contributing NGO, not the primary producing organization.


**2. The Food Waste Index Report 2024, which tracks global food waste at retail and consumer levels, directly supports the goals of which Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator?**

(a) SDG 12.3.1 (a), related to reducing post-harvest food losses.

(d) The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Health Accounts Estimates for India are derived using the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011, a globally recognized framework for classifying and comparing health expenditures.  This framework allows for cross-country comparisons. Option (a) is incorrect; IPHS is a digital monitoring platform, not a framework for financial accounting. Option (c) is incorrect; NQAS is related to quality assessment of healthcare facilities, not financial accounting. Option (d) is incorrect; PMJAY is a health insurance scheme, not a data framework. This tests factual recall of a specific framework used in a national health report.


**4. The ‘Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)’ recently published a report emphasizing the importance of investments in nutritious food value chains.  What is a key outcome GAIN highlights as a result of such investments?**

(a) Increased reliance on imported food products
(b) Reduction of gender inequalities and increased business resilience
(c) Decreased employment opportunities in the agricultural sector
(d) Increased reliance on chemical fertilizers


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The GAIN report specifically highlights the reduction of gender inequalities, increased productivity, and enhanced business resilience as key outcomes of investments in nutritious food value chains. Option (a) is incorrect; investments aim to improve local food systems. Option (c) is incorrect; improved value chains typically lead to more employment. Option (d) is incorrect; while possibly a factor in some value chains, it's not the central focus of GAIN's report. This question tests understanding of the specific findings of a report published by a particular organization.


**5. The recently launched Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India. Which of the following is NOT a primary goal of this initiative?**

(a) Enhancing infrastructure in tribal villages, including road connectivity and access to technology.
(b) Promoting skill development and entrepreneurship among tribal populations.

It does not aim to ban traditional practices. Option (a), (b), and (d) are all explicitly mentioned as goals. This question assesses the understanding of the core objectives of a specific government scheme by identifying a non-goal.


**6. Which organization is responsible for publishing the annual Global Hunger Index (GHI)?**

(a) The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
(b)  Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
(c) The World Bank
(d) The World Food Programme (WFP)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is published annually by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.  While the FAO, World Bank, and WFP are all involved in issues related to hunger and food security, the GHI is specifically the responsibility of Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. This tests factual recall of the organizations responsible for a specific report.


**7. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 introduced new categories for ranking educational institutions. Which of the following was NOT a newly added category in the 2024 NIRF rankings?**

(a) Open Universities

(d)  West Bengal, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question tests factual recall of specific data from the 2001 Census.  The correct answer is Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and focuses on specific details within the text.


**1.  Which initiative aims to enhance the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence and outreach, drawing from the learnings of PM-JANMAN?**

(a)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(c)  National Health Mission
(d)  Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) explicitly aims to improve the socio-economic status of tribal communities by focusing on infrastructure development, healthcare, education, and livelihood opportunities.  It leverages the successes and lessons learned from the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN).  Option (a), Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, focuses primarily on education. Option (c), National Health Mission, concentrates on healthcare. Option (d), DAPST, is a funding mechanism, not a specific initiative with the stated goals.  Therefore, PM-JUGA is the most accurate answer.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of government schemes targeting tribal welfare.


**2.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024, released by which organization in collaboration with WRAP, tracks global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels, supporting the goals of SDG 12.3?**

(a)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(b)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(c)  UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
(d)  International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), in conjunction with WRAP, released the Food Waste Index Report 2024.  The report's focus aligns with SDG 12.3 goals related to reducing food waste. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all UN agencies involved in food security and nutrition but are not the primary releaser of this specific report.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to link an organization to a specific publication and its objectives. The difficulty lies in the subtle differences between the roles of various UN agencies in food-related initiatives.


**3.  Which Act recognizes the right to food as a statutory right and is referenced in relation to initiatives tackling global hunger?**

(a)  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006
(b)  The Consumer Protection Act, 2019
(c)  The National Food Security Act, 2013
(d)  The Companies Act, 2013


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Act, 2013, explicitly grants the right to food as a statutory right. This is directly mentioned in the text in the context of initiatives to combat hunger. The other options are related to different legal frameworks and do not address the right to food.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to connect specific legislation with broader policy goals. The distractors are plausible because they are all significant Acts but do not address the core theme of the question.


**4.  Under which scheme are 1000 tribal homestays to be promoted to tap the tourist potential, implemented through the Ministry of Tourism under Swadesh Darshan?**

(a)  PM-KISAN
(b)  PM-JUGA
(c)  National Health Mission
(d)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is explicitly mentioned as the scheme promoting 1000 tribal homestays under Swadesh Darshan.  The other options are unrelated to this specific initiative.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to associate a specific program with a larger government scheme. The difficulty lies in differentiating various government initiatives targeting tribal welfare.


**5.  The "Lakhpati Didi" initiative, aiming to enable three crore Lakhpati Didis, is an outcome of which mission under the Union Ministry of Rural Development?**

(a)  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
(b)  Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM)
(c)  Jal Jeevan Mission
(d)  PM Gram Sadak Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that the "Lakhpati Didi" initiative is a direct outcome of the Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM). The other options relate to different rural development programs but are not directly linked to the "Lakhpati Didi" initiative.  This question assesses factual recall and understanding of specific government programs aimed at women's empowerment.  The distractors are plausible as they are all relevant rural development schemes.


**6.  Which international organization, established in 1961, provides food aid and works to combat hunger worldwide, and is mentioned in the context of initiatives to tackle global hunger?**

(a)  UNICEF
(b)  WHO
(c)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(d)  IFAD


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The World Food Programme (WFP) is specifically identified in the text as the food assistance branch of the United Nations, established in 1961, with a mission to combat global hunger.  The other options, while involved in related areas, do not match this specific description. This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify the specific role of an international organization in addressing global food security.  The distractors are plausible because they are all significant actors in global health and development.


**7.  Which report, released by five specialized UN agencies including FAO and WHO, focuses on financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition and highlights that the world is far off track to achieve SDG 2, Zero Hunger?**

(a)  Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)
(b)  Food Waste Index Report 2024
(c)  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024
(d)  The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly describes the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, as being released by five UN agencies, including FAO and WHO. It also highlights the report's focus on financing to combat hunger and malnutrition, and its assessment of progress towards SDG 2.  The other options are related reports but do not meet all the criteria mentioned in the question.  This question assesses factual recall and understanding of key reports related to global food security.  The distractors are similar reports, making it a difficult question.


**8. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in Brazil, aims to support efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty, aligning with which Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?**

(a)  SDGs 3 and 4
(b)  SDGs 1 and 2
(c)  SDGs 5 and 6
(d)  SDGs 8 and 9


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty aims to support efforts to eradicate hunger (SDG 2) and poverty (SDG 1).  The other options present irrelevant SDGs. This question tests factual recall and the ability to link a global initiative to specific Sustainable Development Goals. The question's difficulty stems from the need to remember the specific SDG numbers.


**9.  The virtual NQAS Assessment and Spot food license initiative, launched by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, promotes "Healthcare for All" and is launched in compliance with which standards?**

(a)  WHO standards
(b)  Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS)
(c)  Global Nutrition Standards
(d)  FAO standards


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly mentions that the NQAS Assessment is launched in compliance with Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS). The other options are incorrect as they are not the specific standards mentioned in relation to this initiative. This question tests factual recall regarding specific health standards in India. The difficulty arises from the need to remember the exact name of the Indian health standards.


**10.  The "Conservation cum Development (CCD)" plans are a micro-plan approach used in the development of which vulnerable group?**

(a)  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)
(b)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(c)  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(d)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly links the "Conservation cum Development (CCD)" plans to the development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). The other options are not associated with this specific planning approach. This question tests factual recall and the ability to connect a planning strategy with a specific target group. The difficulty lies in the understanding of the nuances between different vulnerable groups.


**1.  A ranking framework evaluates educational institutions across India based on several parameters. Which of the following is NOT a parameter used in this framework?**

(a) Teaching, Learning, and Resources
(b) Research and Professional Practices
(c) Infrastructure and Funding
(d) Outreach and Inclusivity

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) uses five key parameters to rank educational institutions: Teaching, Learning, and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.  Infrastructure and funding, while crucial for an institution's success, are not explicitly listed as independent parameters within the NIRF methodology.  The framework focuses on the outcomes and impact of resource allocation rather than the mere amount of resources.  Option (a), (b), and (d) are all core components directly assessed by the NIRF. Option (c) introduces a potentially misleading distractor focusing on a related but distinct aspect of institutional quality.  The NIRF focuses on the effectiveness of teaching, research, and outreach rather than simply the level of funding or infrastructure.  Therefore, an institution might have excellent infrastructure but still score poorly on other parameters, leading to a lower overall ranking.


**2.  The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings employ a multi-faceted evaluation system.  Which of the following BEST describes a key aspect NOT considered in their ranking methodology?**

(a)  Assessment of teaching quality and resources.
(b)  Evaluation of research output and its global impact.
(c)  Analysis of student satisfaction and campus life.
(d)  Examination of industry collaborations and international outlook.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The THE World University Rankings utilize 18 indicators across five key areas: teaching, research environment, research quality, industry engagement, and international outlook.  While student experience is undoubtedly important, it is not explicitly a primary component of the THE ranking system.  The ranking emphasizes factors more directly measurable and quantifiable, such as research publications, citations, and industry partnerships.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all clearly incorporated into the THE ranking criteria.  The omission of student satisfaction and campus life as primary factors is a deliberate choice, reflecting the ranking's focus on objective and measurable indicators of institutional performance on a global scale. The inclusion of student feedback might introduce subjectivity and inconsistencies across institutions with varying student demographics and cultural contexts.


**3.  A significant development in higher education involves the establishment of foreign university campuses in India. Which regulatory framework governs this process?**

(a) The Foreign Education Regulatory Authority Act, 2022
(b) The National Education Policy, 2020
(c) The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023
(d) The Indian Institutes of Technology Act, 1961


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, specifically address the establishment and operation of foreign university campuses in India.  While the National Education Policy, 2020, envisions increased international collaboration in higher education, it does not provide the specific regulatory framework for foreign campuses.  The other options are irrelevant to this specific context. The UGC regulations outline the criteria for eligibility, the application process, and the operational guidelines for foreign higher educational institutions seeking to establish campuses in India.  These regulations aim to ensure quality and standards while promoting internationalization in Indian higher education.  This careful approach aims to balance the benefits of international collaboration with the need to maintain the integrity and quality of Indian higher education.


**4.  The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) focuses on addressing a critical global challenge. What is the primary area of GAIN's operations?**

(a)  Promoting sustainable agriculture practices.
(b)  Improving access to nutritious foods.
(c)  Advocating for universal healthcare access.
(d)  Developing innovative technologies for water purification.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GAIN, a Swiss-based NGO, primarily works to improve access to nutritious foods.  While sustainable agriculture and healthcare are indirectly related, GAIN's core mission centers on tackling malnutrition through increased access to essential nutrients.  The organization focuses on public-private partnerships to enhance the availability and affordability of nutritious food products.  Options (a), (c), and (d) represent important global development goals but are not the central focus of GAIN's activities.  GAIN's work aligns directly with the Sustainable Development Goals related to food security and nutrition, emphasizing the crucial role of nutrition in overall human well-being and development.  The organization's approach involves working with governments, businesses, and civil society organizations to create sustainable solutions for improving nutrition outcomes.


**5.  A report assesses the global impact of food waste and its environmental consequences. Which organization is primarily responsible for producing the Food Waste Index Report?**

(a)  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(b)  The World Food Programme (WFP)
(c)  The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(d)  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in collaboration with WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme), publishes the Food Waste Index Report.  While the FAO, WFP, and IFPRI all work on food-related issues, the UNEP specifically focuses on environmental aspects, making it the lead organization for a report assessing the environmental impact of food waste.  The report tracks global and national food waste generation levels, highlighting the environmental and economic consequences. The report's findings support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 12.3, which aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030. The UNEP's involvement underscores the growing recognition of food waste as a significant environmental challenge demanding global attention and action.


**6. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) has launched several key initiatives to foster research and innovation in India. Which of the following is NOT among these initiatives?**

(a) Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(b) Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(c) National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC)
(d) ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ANRF has launched PAIR, MAHA, and ACE initiatives to promote research and innovation. The NSDC, while related to skill development, is a separate entity and not an initiative directly under the ANRF.  PAIR aims to pair universities with established institutions for mentorship, MAHA supports solution-focused research in priority areas, and ACE establishes world-class research centers.  The ANRF's initiatives are designed to create a robust research ecosystem in India, aligning with the goals of the National Education Policy.  Option (c) is a plausible distractor due to its relevance to national development goals but is not directly linked to the ANRF's specific programs.  The focus of the ANRF is on fundamental and applied research, distinct from the vocational training focus of the NSDC.


**7.  A government scheme aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India. What is the name of this scheme?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)
(c)  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(d)  Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is a government scheme designed to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India.  The other options are unrelated government schemes targeting different aspects of national development.  PMJDY focuses on financial inclusion, PM-KISAN on farmer income support, and AB-PMJAY on healthcare.  PM-JUGA aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods within tribal communities through convergence of existing schemes and targeted outreach. The name itself, inspired by Birsa Munda, highlights the scheme's focus on empowering tribal communities.  The scheme's multi-pronged approach seeks to achieve sustainable and holistic development within tribal areas.


**8.  Several global rankings evaluate universities worldwide. Which of the following ranking systems is NOT mentioned in the provided text?**

(a) QS World University Rankings
(b) Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings
(c)  ShanghaiRanking's Global Ranking of Academic Subjects
(d)  THE University Impact Rankings


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text mentions QS World University Rankings, Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings, and THE University Impact Rankings.  The ShanghaiRanking's Global Ranking of Academic Subjects is not included in the provided text.  The text focuses on a selection of prominent global university ranking systems, showcasing their methodologies and the performance of Indian institutions within these rankings.  Option (c) acts as a distractor, introducing a reputable ranking system not discussed in the given text, testing the reader's knowledge of global university ranking systems beyond those explicitly mentioned. The inclusion of other ranking systems would have broadened the scope of the text beyond its current focus.


**MCQs from Source Content:**

**5. (b)**  What is the primary function of the Public Accounts Committee?

(a) To investigate allegations of corruption within the government.
(b) To examine the annual audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).
(c) To draft legislation related to government finances.
(d) To oversee the functioning of the Reserve Bank of India.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Public Accounts Committee's core mandate is scrutinizing the CAG's audit reports, which encompass appropriation accounts, finance accounts, and public undertaking audits.  This allows the committee to hold the government accountable for its financial management. Option (a) is partially true, as financial irregularities may be uncovered during this process, but it's not the primary function. Options (c) and (d) are entirely unrelated to the PAC's responsibilities.  The committee's role is oversight and review, not legislative drafting or RBI supervision. Its work is crucial for maintaining financial probity and transparency in government operations, a key aspect of good governance emphasized in the UPSC syllabus.


**6. (c)** Which of the following statements accurately describes the Collegium System in India?

(a) It is a system enshrined in the Constitution for judicial appointments.
(b) The government plays the dominant role in appointing judges.
(c) It is a system of judicial appointments evolved through Supreme Court judgments.
(d) The Chief Justice of India has no say in the selection of High Court judges.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Collegium system, a unique feature of the Indian judicial landscape, isn't explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. It's a product of Supreme Court pronouncements, gradually shaping the process of judicial appointments.  This makes option (a) incorrect. Option (b) is incorrect because the government's role is limited to consultation and raising objections after the Collegium makes its recommendations. Option (d) is false; the CJI plays a crucial role, especially in High Court collegium recommendations, which need Supreme Court Collegium approval before reaching the government. The Collegium system's evolution and its implications for judicial independence are recurring themes in the UPSC examination, demanding a nuanced understanding.


**7. (c)** What is the current status of passive euthanasia in India?

(a) It is completely illegal and punishable by law.
(b) It is legal only in specific cases involving terminally ill patients.
(c) It has been legally recognized by the Supreme Court under certain conditions.
(d) The legality of passive euthanasia is yet to be determined by the Supreme Court.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The Supreme Court of India has acknowledged the legality of passive euthanasia in specific cases, notably involving terminally ill patients and those in a persistent vegetative state.  However, it's not an unrestricted right.  The court has emphasized that the right to die with dignity must be balanced against other ethical and legal considerations.  Options (a) and (d) are factually incorrect. While option (b) is partially true, it doesn't capture the nuances of the Supreme Court's pronouncements on the matter. The legal and ethical dimensions of passive euthanasia are relevant to the UPSC syllabus, particularly in the context of human rights and healthcare policy.


**8. (b)**  Which of the following statements about the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is/are correct?

(a) It is directly under the control of the Parliament.
(b) It is exempted from the purview of the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
(c) It can suo moto initiate investigations only in Union Territories.
(d) State governments have absolute veto power over CBI investigations within their states.


**Correct Answer:** (b), (c)

**Explanation:** The CBI operates under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions, not directly under Parliament, making (a) incorrect.  The CBI's exemption from the RTI Act, albeit controversial, is a fact, making (b) correct. The CBI's power to suo moto investigate is limited to Union Territories, making (c) correct.  (d) is incorrect because while state consent is required for investigations in states, it's not an absolute veto; courts can order CBI probes.  The CBI's structure, powers, and limitations are regularly discussed in the UPSC context, especially in relation to governance and accountability.


**9. (d)**  What is the composition of the Lokpal in India?

(a) It consists solely of judicial members.
(b) The selection committee includes representatives from only the legislative branch.
(c) The Lokpal chairperson is appointed by the President without any recommendations.
(d) It is a multi-member body with a chairperson and a maximum of eight members, including judicial and non-judicial members, with representation from various social groups.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Lokpal is a multi-member body comprising a chairperson and up to eight members, reflecting the diverse expertise required for effective anti-corruption work.  The inclusion of both judicial and non-judicial members ensures a balanced approach.  The selection committee's composition includes representatives from the executive, legislature, and judiciary, underscoring the importance of consensus in its appointments. Options (a), (b), and (c) misrepresent the Lokpal's structure and appointment process.  Understanding the Lokpal's composition and functioning is vital for the UPSC, especially in the context of governance and anti-corruption measures.


**10. (b)** Which of the following statements regarding contempt of court is/are correct?

(a) Only willful disobedience of a court order constitutes contempt.
(b) Scandalizing the court can be considered criminal contempt.
(c) The punishment for contempt is limited to a fine only.
(d) Civil contempt involves only a breach of an undertaking to the court.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Both civil and criminal contempt have distinct definitions. Civil contempt encompasses willful disobedience of court orders *or* breach of undertakings. Criminal contempt includes acts that scandalize the court or interfere with the administration of justice.  The punishment for contempt can include both imprisonment and fines.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are either partially true or entirely incorrect.  The UPSC often tests knowledge of the Contempt of Courts Act and its implications for the judiciary's authority.


**11. (d)** Which of the following Articles of the Indian Constitution is related to the protection of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes?

(a) Only Article 15.
(b) Articles 15 and 17 only.
(c) Articles 15, 17, and 46 only.
(d) Articles 15, 17, 46, 338, and 339.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  Several articles in the Indian Constitution explicitly address the protection and upliftment of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Article 15 prohibits discrimination, Article 17 abolishes untouchability, Article 46 promotes their educational and economic interests, Article 338 establishes the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, and Article 339 empowers presidential intervention in Scheduled Areas and Tribes' administration.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and do not capture the comprehensive constitutional framework for their protection.  Knowledge of these articles and their interrelationship is essential for the UPSC.


**12. (b)** What is the significance of 'general consent' in the context of CBI investigations?

(a) It grants the CBI unlimited powers to investigate any case in any state.
(b) It allows the CBI to investigate cases in a state without seeking individual consent for each case.
(c) It is mandatory for the CBI to obtain general consent before investigating any case.
(d) General consent is only applicable to cases related to terrorism.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** 'General consent' allows the CBI to conduct investigations within a state without needing case-specific consent from the state government each time.  While the DSPE Act mandates state government consent, general consent streamlines the process.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the nature and scope of general consent.  The UPSC frequently tests understanding of the relationship between the central and state governments and the implications of such legal provisions.


**MCQs based on Target Content:**


**1.  A foreign higher educational institution (FHEI) seeking to establish a campus in India under the UGC regulations of 2023 must meet which of the following criteria?**

(a) Be ranked among the top 100 universities globally in at least one subject area.
(b) Secure a letter of intent (LoI) from the Ministry of External Affairs.
(c) Possess outstanding expertise in a specific area or be ranked within the global top 500.
(d) Guarantee a minimum number of Indian students in their programs.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UGC regulations specify that FHEIs must either be globally ranked within the top 500 or possess exceptional expertise in a particular field to establish campuses in India. Option (a) is too restrictive; the top 500 threshold is broader. Option (b) is incorrect; the LoI comes from the UGC. Option (d) is not a stated criterion.  The regulations aim to attract high-quality institutions, a crucial aspect of the NEP's internationalization strategy.


**2.  The National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates, released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, serve what primary purpose?**

(a) To track the prevalence of specific diseases across India.
(b) To assess the effectiveness of public health campaigns.
(c) To provide a detailed description of the financial flows within India’s health system.
(d) To compare India's healthcare spending with other BRICS nations.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** NHA estimates offer a comprehensive picture of the financial dynamics of India's health sector, tracking fund sources, allocation across healthcare segments, and service utilization. Options (a) and (b) are functions of other health data sources. Option (d) is not a core function of NHA.  Understanding the NHA's role is essential for analyzing India's healthcare financing and policy.


**3.  Which of the following statements about Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in higher education is correct?**

(a) It primarily focuses on evaluating academic credentials from foreign institutions.
(b) It is a formal mechanism to assess existing knowledge, skills, and experience gained through various learning pathways.
(c) It is solely applicable to students who have completed vocational training programs.
(d) It replaces traditional degree programs with alternative assessment methods.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** RPL formally assesses knowledge, skills, and experience acquired through formal, non-formal, or informal learning, integrating these into the formal education system. Option (a) is too narrow; RPL encompasses diverse learning pathways. Option (c) is incorrect; it's not limited to vocational training. Option (d) is incorrect; it complements, not replaces, traditional degrees. RPL's role in bridging the gap between formal and informal learning is relevant to the UPSC's focus on education policy.


**4. According to the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, what is the initial approval granted to an applicant FHEI?**

(a) Full accreditation to operate a campus in India.
(b) Permanent registration as a foreign university branch in India.
(c) In-principle approval and a Letter of Intent (LoI).
(d) Conditional approval pending a site visit by UGC officials.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UGC initially grants in-principle approval and issues an LoI.  Full accreditation and permanent registration come later. Option (d) is not the process outlined in the regulations.  The phased approval process is a key feature of the regulations, designed to manage the entry of foreign universities.


**5. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 rankings introduced which of the following new categories?**

(a) Private Engineering Colleges and Medical Colleges.
(b) Central Universities and Deemed Universities.
(c) Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities.
(d)  International Universities and Research Institutes.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  NIRF 2024 expanded its scope to include Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities.  Options (a) and (b) already existed in previous NIRF rankings.  Option (d) is unrelated to the 2024 expansion.  NIRF's evolving methodology and coverage are relevant to the UPSC's focus on the higher education sector.


**6.  The amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, introduced which of the following key mechanisms?**

(a) A global fund to compensate countries affected by pandemics.
(b) A system for preemptively banning international travel during outbreaks.
(c) A Coordinating Financial Mechanism to support developing countries.
(d) A mandatory global health tax on international trade.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The IHR amendments established a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to specifically address the needs of developing countries during public health emergencies. Options (a), (b), and (d) are not part of the amendments. Understanding the IHR's role in global health governance and the nature of its recent reforms is important for the UPSC syllabus.


**7.  Which organization publishes the Times Higher Education (THE) University Impact Rankings?**

(a) Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)
(b)  The World Bank
(c)  Times Higher Education
(d)  UNESCO


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The THE publishes its University Impact Rankings, which assess universities based on their contributions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are other organizations involved in university rankings but not this specific one.  The UPSC often examines various global university ranking systems and their methodologies.


**8.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, introduced a provision for which age group of children in conflict with the law to potentially be tried as adults?**

(a) 12-15 years
(b) 14-17 years
(c) 16-18 years
(d) 18-21 years


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Act allows for children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults for heinous crimes after a preliminary assessment. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect age ranges for this specific provision.  Understanding the juvenile justice system and its complexities is relevant to the UPSC's examination of social justice and child welfare.


**9. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, is enacted under which Article of the Indian Constitution?**

(a) Article 14
(b) Article 21
(c) Article 15(3)
(d) Article 370


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PWDVA is enacted under Article 15(3), which empowers the legislature to make special provisions for women and children.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are unrelated to the legal basis of the PWDVA.  Knowing the constitutional basis of laws related to women's protection is crucial for the UPSC.


**10.  The Model Foster Care Guidelines, 2024, are aligned with which of the following acts and regulations?**

(a) The Right to Education Act, 2009.
(b) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and related model rules and regulations.
(c) The Adoption Regulations, 2017.
(d) The National Policy for Children, 2013.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The MFCG 2024 are explicitly designed to work within the framework of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, and its related rules and the Adoption Regulations, 2022, and Mission Vatsalya.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are not the primary legal frameworks guiding these guidelines.  The UPSC examines the intersection of various social welfare policies and laws.


**1.  Which organization, in collaboration with WRAP, released the Food Waste Index Report 2024, highlighting the significant amount of food wasted globally and its environmental impact?**

(a) World Food Programme
(b) Food and Agriculture Organization
(c) United Nations Environment Programme
(d) World Health Organization


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 was a collaborative effort between UNEP and WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme).  The report meticulously tracked global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels.  This data is crucial for understanding the scale of food waste and its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with SDG 12.3.1 (b).  The World Food Programme (a) focuses on food assistance and security, while the Food and Agriculture Organization (b) plays a broader role in agriculture and food systems, including food loss reduction (SDG 12.3.1 (a)). The World Health Organization (d) primarily focuses on global health issues.  Therefore, only UNEP, with its mandate encompassing environmental protection and sustainable development, is the accurate partner for this specific report. The report's findings underscore the urgency of addressing food waste to achieve sustainability goals.


**2. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, revealed that hunger levels are alarming in how many countries, jeopardizing the "Zero Hunger" goal by 2030?**

(a) 25
(b) 30
(c) 35
(d) 42


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (d) 42. The GHI 2024 report explicitly stated that hunger levels in 42 countries are at alarming levels, making the achievement of the "Zero Hunger" Sustainable Development Goal by 2030 highly unlikely. This finding highlights the significant challenges in eradicating hunger globally and the need for increased efforts and resources. Options (a), (b), and (c) represent incorrect figures; the report clearly specifies 42 countries as experiencing critically high levels of hunger.  The report further emphasized the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, indicating the complexity of the issue and the need for multifaceted solutions.


**3.  Which Indian government initiative provides free food grains to a significant portion of the impoverished population, aiming to alleviate hunger and food insecurity?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(b) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(c) Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana
(d) National Food Security Act, 2013


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY).  PMGKAY is a flagship program designed to provide free food grains to approximately 80 crore (800 million) poor individuals in India.  This initiative directly addresses food insecurity and contributes significantly to improving nutritional status. While Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (a) provides financial assistance and nutritional support to mothers, and Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 (b) focus on supplementary nutrition, they do not have the same scale of direct food grain provision as PMGKAY. The National Food Security Act, 2013 (d), although crucial for recognizing the right to food, is a legislative framework, not a specific program providing direct food distribution on the scale of PMGKAY.  Therefore, PMGKAY stands out as the most impactful program directly addressing food grain provision to a massive segment of the impoverished population.

(c) European Union, FAO, and WFP
(d)  G20 and UN


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) European Union, FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), and WFP (World Food Programme).  The GNAFC was explicitly launched as a partnership between these three major international organizations at the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016. The GNAFC aims to improve coordination and effectiveness in addressing food crises by bringing together governments, international organizations, and NGOs.  UNICEF and WHO (a) primarily focus on children's welfare and global health, respectively. The World Bank and IMF (b) are primarily focused on financial and economic development. The G20 and UN (d) are broader intergovernmental forums, not specific organizations directly involved in the GNAFC's foundational structure.  The GNAFC's multi-organizational foundation emphasizes a collaborative approach to tackling the complex challenges that contribute to global food crises.

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) Top 500. The UGC regulations explicitly state that foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) must be ranked within the top 500 globally, either overall or in specific subject areas, to be eligible to establish campuses in India. This criterion ensures a high standard of academic excellence for participating foreign universities. Options (a), (c), and (d) represent less stringent ranking thresholds; the regulations specifically target institutions within the top 500 globally to maintain a high level of quality and competitiveness in India's higher education system.  The policy aims to enhance the quality and internationalization of Indian higher education by attracting leading foreign institutions.


**7.  The  "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains: An Opportunity for Gender Impact" report, promoting nutrition investments in the agri-food sector, was released by which organization?**

(a)  FAO
(b)  World Bank
(c) GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition)
(d)  IFAD


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition).  The report title is explicitly associated with GAIN's focus on improving nutrition through investments in the agri-food sector and reducing gender inequalities.  The FAO (a), World Bank (b), and IFAD (d) are all involved in aspects of food security and development, but the specific report mentioned is directly linked to GAIN's mandate and initiatives. GAIN's focus on gender impact within the nutrition sector is a key aspect of the report's message, highlighting the organization's commitment to equitable and sustainable improvements in nutrition.


**8. Which of the following statements accurately describes the key amendment made to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, during the 77th World Health Assembly regarding the definition of a pandemic emergency?**

(a)  It requires a disease to be solely airborne to qualify as a pandemic emergency.
(b) It defines a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread or high risk of such spread, exceeding national health system response capabilities.
(c)  It narrows the definition of pandemic emergency to only include diseases with high mortality rates.
(d) It removes the requirement for international collaboration in responding to pandemic emergencies.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). The amendment to the IHR, 2005, specifically defines a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease exhibiting wide geographical spread or a high risk of such spread, and surpassing the capacity of national health systems to respond effectively. This broadened definition reflects the lessons learned from recent health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and robust response mechanisms. Option (a) is too restrictive, as many pandemics are not solely airborne. Option (c) is also too narrow, as many pandemics are characterized by high morbidity rather than solely high mortality. Option (d) is incorrect, as improved international collaboration is a key aspect of the revised regulations. The amendment aims to provide a clearer and more comprehensive framework for international collaboration in managing public health emergencies.


**9. In the context of the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, which specific right, granted under Section 3(1)(e), was recently approved for the Juangs of Keonjhar and Mankidia tribes in Odisha?**

(a)  Right to education
(b) Right to employment
(c) Habitat rights
(d)  Right to healthcare


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Habitat rights.  The news specifically mentions the approval of habitat rights for the Juangs of Keonjhar and Mankidia tribes under Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA, 2006.  This right is crucial for the preservation of the traditional livelihoods and cultural practices of these Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  While the FRA also encompasses other rights such as rights to education (a), employment (b), and healthcare (d), the news explicitly focuses on the approval of habitat rights. This highlights the significance of this specific right in securing the long-term well-being and cultural survival of the PVTGs.  Habitat rights, as defined by the FRA, encompass the customary habitat and other habitats within reserved and protected forests.


**10. The  "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024" was a collaborative effort of how many specialized UN agencies?**

(a) Three
(b) Four
(c) Five
(d) Six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Five. The report explicitly states that it was a collaborative effort of five UN specialized agencies: FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO. This collaborative approach underscores the multi-faceted nature of food security and nutrition challenges and the need for a coordinated global response. The involvement of multiple agencies highlights the diverse expertise required to address the complex issues relating to food security, from agricultural production to health and nutrition.  The report's findings and recommendations are thus more comprehensive and impactful due to this collaborative approach.


**1.  Which organization released the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, highlighting alarming hunger levels in numerous countries and linking gender inequality and climate change to food insecurity?**

(a) The World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
(c) Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
(d) The World Health Organization (WHO)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 was released by Concern Worldwide, a non-governmental organization (NGO) from Ireland, and Welthungerhilfe, an NGO from Germany.  The report's key findings included alarming hunger levels in 42 countries, making the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 unattainable.  It emphasized the significant links between gender inequality, climate change, and the prevalence of hunger, noting that women and girls are disproportionately affected by food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly due to weather extremes and climate emergencies. The WFP, FAO, and WHO, while involved in global food security and nutrition initiatives, were not the releasing organizations for this specific GHI report.  The report's focus on gender inequality and climate change as critical factors in hunger is a key element often discussed in the context of sustainable development goals and global food security strategies.


**2. Which Indian government initiative aims to provide free food grains to a significant portion of the impoverished population?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(b) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(c) Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)
(d) National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) is a flagship program of the Indian government designed to provide free food grains to approximately 80 crore (800 million) poor people.  While the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, recognizes the right to food as a statutory right, PMGKAY is the specific initiative focused on providing free food grains.  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 address maternal health and nutrition and supplementary nutrition, respectively, but not the direct provision of free food grains on the scale of PMGKAY.  Understanding the nuances of these different programs is crucial for analyzing India's approach to poverty alleviation and food security.

(c) The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA)
(d) The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Habitat rights for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) are granted under Section 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA).  This Act specifically addresses the rights of forest-dwelling communities, including PVTGs, to their traditional habitats.  Other acts listed deal with different aspects of tribal welfare and human rights but do not specifically address habitat rights within the context of PVTGs and their relationship with forest lands.  A thorough understanding of the FRA is essential for analyzing policies related to tribal rights and forest conservation in India.  The FRA's provisions are critical for protecting the livelihoods and cultural heritage of forest-dwelling communities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme that focuses on the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs.  It emphasizes the preservation of their cultural heritage while promoting their overall well-being.  The scheme receives 100% central assistance, highlighting the government's commitment to supporting these vulnerable communities.  Other schemes listed may support tribal communities, but they don't specifically target PVTGs with a focus on comprehensive socio-economic development and 100% central funding.  The scheme's design reflects a holistic approach to tribal development, emphasizing both economic empowerment and cultural preservation.


**8.  The Supreme Court case, Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others, addressed which key issue related to the treatment of Denotified Tribes (DNTs) within the prison system?**

(a) Inadequate healthcare facilities for DNT prisoners
(b) Lack of educational opportunities for DNT prisoners
(c) Caste-based discrimination against DNT prisoners
(d) Limited access to legal aid for DNT prisoners


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court case, Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others, specifically addressed the issue of caste-based discrimination against Denotified Tribes (DNTs) within prisons.  The court struck down provisions in several state prison manuals that perpetuated such discrimination, highlighting the unconstitutionality of these practices.  While other issues related to DNT prisoners might exist, this specific case focused on the unconstitutional nature of caste-based discrimination within the prison system.  The ruling underscores the importance of upholding constitutional rights for all individuals, including marginalized communities, within the justice system.  The case serves as a landmark decision in addressing systemic injustices faced by DNTs.

(b) The Incheon Strategy
(c) The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)
(d) The Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is the correct answer.  Adopted in New York in 2006 and entering into force in 2008, its primary objective is to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.  The other options, while related to disability rights and inclusion, are not the primary international convention focused on this specific goal. The Biwako Millennium Framework and the Incheon Strategy, while working towards inclusive societies, are frameworks and strategies, respectively, not the comprehensive international treaty that the UN-CRPD is. The Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region is a regional declaration, narrower in scope than the global UN-CRPD.  The UN-CRPD has 164 signatories, demonstrating its widespread international acceptance and significance in the global movement for disability rights.  Understanding the distinction between a convention (a legally binding treaty) and a framework or declaration is crucial for comprehending the international legal landscape surrounding disability rights.

**2.  Which scheme, launched by the Prime Minister, aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence and outreach, and is named after a tribal leader known for resisting the British Empire?**

(b) PM-JUGA (Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan)
(c) PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
(d) Swadesh Darshan

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), also known as Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan, is the correct answer.  This scheme directly addresses the socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities. Its key feature is the convergence of various existing schemes to achieve its objectives. The name "Dharti Aaba" is a reference to Birsa Munda, a significant tribal leader who led resistance against British rule.  PM-JANMAN, while related to tribal welfare, is not the specific scheme described in the question. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) focuses on housing, and Swadesh Darshan focuses on tourism, both components within the broader PM-JUGA but not its central aim. PM-JUGA's comprehensive approach, encompassing infrastructure development, healthcare improvements, educational opportunities, and livelihood enhancement, distinguishes it as the scheme fitting the question's description.  The scheme's design leverages existing resources and programs, highlighting efficient resource utilization and synergy between different government initiatives.

PAIR aims to build partnerships between established and newer research institutions. MAHA focuses on high-impact research in priority areas such as EV mobility and advanced materials. ACE aims to establish world-class research centers. The NETF, while important for educational technology, falls outside the ANRF's core mandate of scientific research and innovation.  This distinction highlights the specialized nature of ANRF and its targeted approach to strengthening India's research infrastructure.


**4.  Which organization, in collaboration with WRAP, released the Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024, tracking global and national food waste at retail and consumer levels, and contributing to SDG 12.3.1 (b)?**

(a) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(b) Concern Worldwide
(c) Welthungerhilfe
(d) UN Environment Programme (UNEP)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) is the correct answer.  The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024 is a collaborative effort between UNEP and WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme).  The report tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels, directly contributing to the achievement of SDG 12.3.1 (b), which aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels.  FAO, while involved in food security and related issues, is not the primary organization responsible for the FWI report. Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe are NGOs involved in hunger relief and related work, but they are not the primary publishers of the FWI report. UNEP's role highlights the growing recognition of the environmental impact of food waste and its importance in achieving sustainable development goals.  The report's findings underscore the significant contribution of food waste to greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing the urgency of addressing this issue.


**5.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), launched in 2015 by the Ministry of Education, uses several parameters to rank educational institutions. Which of the following is NOT a parameter used by NIRF?**

(a) Teaching, Learning, and Resources
(b) Research and Professional Practices
(c) Graduation Outcomes
(d)  Global Research Citations

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Global Research Citations is not a primary parameter used by NIRF. While research output is assessed, the NIRF framework doesn't specifically use global research citations as a distinct parameter. The NIRF framework focuses on evaluating Indian educational institutions based on factors relevant to the Indian context.  Teaching, Learning, and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; and Graduation Outcomes are all core parameters used in the NIRF ranking system.  These parameters provide a holistic assessment of an institution's performance across various aspects.  The exclusion of global research citations does not diminish the importance of research; it simply reflects the NIRF's focus on evaluating institutions based on metrics directly relevant to their domestic context and performance.  The omission also suggests a potential area for future refinement of the ranking framework, considering the increasing global interconnectedness of research.

(b) The Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992
(c) The National Trust for the Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act, 1999
(d) The Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, is the correct answer. This Act, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act (FRA), specifically grants habitat rights to PVTGs under Section 3(1)(e). The other options are related to different aspects of social welfare and legislation but do not address the specific provision of habitat rights to PVTGs under the framework of forest rights.  The FRA's significance lies in its recognition of the historical and customary rights of forest-dwelling communities, including PVTGs, who have a deep-rooted connection with forest lands.  The Act aims to secure their land and habitat rights, contributing to their overall well-being and empowerment.  Understanding the FRA is crucial for comprehending the legal framework protecting the rights of vulnerable tribal populations in India.


**7.  Which of the following initiatives is NOT directly involved in addressing hunger and malnutrition in India, as highlighted in the context of initiatives taken to tackle hunger?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)
(b) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(c) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(d) National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is not directly involved in addressing hunger and malnutrition in India.  NIRF focuses on ranking educational institutions, a distinct area from food security and nutrition programs.  PMGKAY provides free food grains to the poor. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana provides financial assistance and nutritional support to mothers. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on supplementary nutrition for children.  These three initiatives directly contribute to improving nutritional status and reducing hunger.  The exclusion of NIRF underscores the specific and targeted nature of government programs designed to tackle hunger and malnutrition.  It highlights the importance of distinguishing between different sectors and their respective roles in national development.


**8. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, revealed alarming hunger levels in numerous countries.  Which of the following is NOT a key finding highlighted in the GHI report related to India's situation?**

(a) India's ranking improved compared to the previous year.
(b) A significant percentage of India's population suffers from undernourishment.
(c) Child wasting and stunting remain high in India.
(d) India achieved 'Zero Hunger' status.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India has not achieved "Zero Hunger" status, making (d) the incorrect statement.  The GHI report indicates that India still faces serious challenges related to hunger and malnutrition.  India's ranking improved, but this does not mean the problem is solved.  Undernourishment and high rates of child wasting and stunting remain significant concerns. The GHI report's findings highlight the persistent need for continued efforts to address hunger and malnutrition in India.  The report's data emphasizes the complexity of the issue and the need for multi-faceted approaches to tackle its root causes.  The report’s findings also highlight the need for addressing underlying issues such as gender inequality, climate change, and maternal malnutrition, which contribute to the perpetuation of poor nutritional status across generations.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on science and technology,  with detailed explanations:


**1.  A national initiative aims to bridge critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities by converging various schemes.  This initiative, named after a prominent tribal leader who resisted the British Empire, is primarily funded through which existing source?**

(a)  Dedicated tribal welfare budgets allocated annually
(b)  Funds from the Ministry of Rural Development's flagship programs
(c)  Existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants
(d)  Contributions from private sector organizations involved in CSR activities

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) leverages existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. This approach reflects a strategy of resource optimization and avoids the creation of entirely new funding streams. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they are not the primary funding sources for PM-JUGA. While other ministries might contribute, the core funding comes from DAPST.  The emphasis on convergence of existing schemes highlights the government's focus on efficient resource allocation and synergy between different developmental initiatives.  This approach is crucial for maximizing impact and avoiding duplication of efforts.


**2.  A new national curriculum for early childhood care and education (ECCE), designed for children aged 3-6 years, is implemented primarily through which existing institutional framework?**

(a)  Government-run primary schools across the country
(b)  Private preschools and kindergartens offering ECCE programs
(c)  Anganwadi centers providing integrated child development services
(d)  Community-based organizations focusing on early childhood development

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Aadharshila, the National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), is specifically designed for implementation in Anganwadi centers.  These centers already function as a crucial part of India's integrated child development services (ICDS), providing a readily available network for the curriculum's rollout. While options (a), (b), and (d) are involved in early childhood education, they do not represent the primary implementation channel for Aadharshila. The choice of Anganwadi centers demonstrates a strategic move to leverage existing infrastructure and reach a wide segment of the population.

**Explanation:** RPL seeks to formally recognize and credit knowledge and skills acquired outside traditional educational settings.  This bridges the gap between formal and informal learning, making higher education more accessible to individuals with diverse learning backgrounds.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent RPL's objectives.  RPL aims to broaden access, not restrict it, and it complements, rather than replaces, formal assessment methods. The integration of informal learning into the formal education system is a crucial element in promoting inclusivity and recognizing diverse learning pathways.  This approach is vital for ensuring that individuals from varied backgrounds have equal opportunities to access higher education.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding, with detailed explanations.  Note that the difficulty is inherent in the specificity and interconnectedness of the facts required to answer correctly.


**1.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to address critical gaps in several sectors to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. Which of the following is NOT a primary focus area of this Abhiyan?**

(a)  Sustainable livelihood opportunities for Forest Rights Act (FRA) patta holders.
(b)  Enhanced access to quality healthcare facilities, including addressing Sickle Cell Disease.
(c)  Promoting the development of large-scale industrial projects in tribal regions to boost employment.
(d)  Improving infrastructure in government residential schools and hostels for tribal children.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

PM-JUGA focuses on holistic development, emphasizing sustainable livelihoods, improved healthcare, and better education for tribal communities.  Option (a) is directly addressed through initiatives supporting FRA patta holders. Option (b) is tackled through initiatives like setting up Centers of Competence for Sickle Cell Disease. Option (d) is explicitly mentioned as a goal of the Abhiyan. Option (c), however, is incorrect.  While economic empowerment is a key goal, the Abhiyan does not prioritize large-scale industrial projects, which could potentially negatively impact the environment and traditional livelihoods of tribal communities.  The focus is on sustainable and community-based development models.  The Abhiyan's approach aligns with principles of sustainable development and empowerment, not large-scale industrialization.


**2.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is a significant international agreement aimed at promoting the rights of persons with disabilities.  Which of the following is NOT a key objective or provision under the UN-CRPD?**

(a)  Promoting respect for the inherent dignity of persons with disabilities.
(b)  Ensuring the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.
(c)  Mandating specific quotas for persons with disabilities in all private sector jobs globally.
(d)  Protecting and ensuring the full participation of persons with disabilities in society.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD aims to create a society that is inclusive and respects the rights and dignity of all persons with disabilities. Options (a), (b), and (d) directly reflect the Convention's core principles.  However, option (c) is inaccurate. While the UN-CRPD promotes the inclusion of persons with disabilities in employment, it does not mandate specific global quotas for private sector jobs.  The Convention encourages states to take appropriate measures to promote employment opportunities, but the specific mechanisms and targets are left to individual countries to determine based on their specific contexts and capacities. The focus is on removing barriers and creating inclusive employment opportunities, not imposing rigid global quotas.


**3. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 highlights several concerning trends related to global hunger. Which of the following statements about the GHI 2024 findings is NOT accurate?**

(a)  The GHI score for India improved compared to the 2023 report.

(d)  Child wasting and stunting remain significant challenges in India, as noted in the GHI 2024.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2024 report reveals that hunger levels remain alarmingly high in many countries, making the 2030 Zero Hunger goal unattainable based on current progress. Options (a) and (d) accurately reflect the report's findings regarding India's GHI score improvement and persistent challenges of child wasting and stunting. Option (b) correctly points to the report's emphasis on the connection between gender inequality and hunger.  Option (c) is incorrect because the report explicitly states that the current trends suggest the Zero Hunger goal is unlikely to be met by 2030.  The report emphasizes the need for significant acceleration in efforts to reduce hunger and malnutrition globally.

**1.  A global initiative promotes the prevention and fight against doping in sports, aiming for a level playing field through harmonized anti-doping legislation and regulations.  Which international treaty embodies this initiative?**

(a) The World Anti-Doping Code
(b) The Olympic Charter
(c) The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport
(d) The International Olympic Committee's Code of Ethics

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, adopted in 2005, is the only international treaty specifically addressing doping in sports.  It aims to create a consistent global approach to anti-doping regulations, unlike the other options which deal with broader aspects of sports governance or ethics, not solely doping.  The World Anti-Doping Code, while influential, is not a legally binding international treaty in the same way as the UNESCO Convention. The Olympic Charter focuses on the overall governance of the Olympic Games, and the IOC's Code of Ethics addresses a broader range of ethical considerations. The UNESCO Convention’s significance lies in its legally binding nature and its role in harmonizing anti-doping efforts worldwide, making it the most suitable answer.  Understanding the legal frameworks governing international sports is crucial for aspirants.

(a) Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE); holistic assessment
(b) Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL); integrating informal learning into formal education
(c) National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET); standardized admission
(d) National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC); institutional accreditation

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a formal mechanism designed to assess and credit prior learning, regardless of its source (formal, non-formal, or informal).  This allows individuals to gain formal recognition for their skills and knowledge, thereby integrating diverse learning experiences into the formal education system. The other options describe different assessment or accreditation methods unrelated to the core concept of RPL. CCE is a method of student assessment, NEET is an entrance exam, and NAAC assesses educational institutions.  The question tests understanding of alternative pathways to formal education and the recognition of skills gained outside conventional academic settings.


**5.  An Indian university achieved a high ranking in a global university ranking system that assesses universities based on their contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Name this university and the ranking organization.**

(a) IIT Bombay; QS World University Rankings
(b) IISc Bangalore; Times Higher Education
(c) Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham; Times Higher Education World University Impact Rankings
(d) IIT Madras; NIRF

This question assesses knowledge of global university ranking systems and their methodologies, as well as the performance of Indian institutions in these rankings. The focus on SDGs highlights the growing importance of social impact in higher education.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  A global initiative launched in Davos 2024, endorsed by the World Economic Forum and India, aims to promote best practices, knowledge sharing, and investments in women's health, education, and enterprise.  This initiative is a direct outcome of which major global event's declaration?**

(a)  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Summit
(b)  The World Health Assembly
(c)  The G20 Leaders’ Summit
(d)  The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes the "Alliance for Global Good," explicitly stating its genesis in Davos 2024 and its endorsement by the WEF and India.  The crucial detail is that it stems from a G20 Leaders’ Declaration. Option (a) is incorrect because, while SDGs are relevant to the Alliance's goals, the initiative's direct origin is the G20 declaration. Option (b) is irrelevant as the World Health Assembly focuses on global health issues, not directly on this gender-focused initiative. Option (d) is too broad; while the Alliance was launched at the WEF meeting, its origin lies in the G20 declaration.  The G20's broad economic and political influence makes it the most logical source for such a multi-faceted initiative.


**2. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, incorporates a definition of "sexual harassment" aligned with which landmark legal precedent?**

(a) The Vishaka Guidelines
(b) The M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India case
(c) The Kesavananda Bharati vs. State of Kerala case
(d) The Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India case


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The POSH Act explicitly references the Supreme Court's Vishaka judgment, which laid down guidelines on sexual harassment at the workplace.  These guidelines became a significant precedent for the Act's formulation. Options (b), (c), and (d) are all important Supreme Court cases, but they are not directly related to the definition of sexual harassment at the workplace as enshrined in the POSH Act.  The Vishaka Guidelines were specifically concerned with establishing legal frameworks to address sexual harassment, making them the only relevant option.


**3.  In the 2024 Global Gender Gap Report, which country secured the top rank, indicating the highest level of gender parity?**

(a)  Norway
(b)  Finland
(c)  Iceland
(d)  Switzerland


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the top-ranked country in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Report.  The report, released by the World Economic Forum, uses the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI).  Iceland consistently ranks highly on gender equality indices, and the provided text indicates Iceland as the top-ranked country in 2024. While Norway and Finland also rank high and are frequently mentioned in discussions of gender equality, Iceland is specifically identified here as the top-ranked nation for that year.  Switzerland, while progressive, did not hold the top spot in the report.


**4. Which of the following international organizations publishes the University Impact Rankings, evaluating universities based on their contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals?**

(a)  QS Quacquarelli Symonds
(b)  Times Higher Education
(c)  ARWU (Shanghai Ranking)
(d)  THE World University Rankings


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question asks about the publisher of the University Impact Rankings.  The provided text clearly states that Times Higher Education (THE) publishes these rankings.  QS Quacquarelli Symonds publishes its own set of university rankings, focusing on different metrics. ARWU (Shanghai Ranking) is another significant ranking system, but it doesn't publish the specific University Impact Rankings based on SDGs.  Option (d) is a general ranking by THE, not the specific impact ranking.  Therefore, only THE accurately fits the description.

(d)  Stanford University


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage specifies that the University of Southampton received the Letter of Intent (LoI) to establish a campus in Gurugram, marking the first such instance under the new UGC regulations.  The other universities, while prestigious, are not mentioned in the context of this specific initiative.  The regulations are designed to attract high-ranking foreign universities to India, and the selection of Southampton demonstrates this policy in action.


**6.  The Global Gender Gap Report 2024, released by the World Economic Forum, assesses gender parity across four key dimensions.  Which of the following dimensions shows the most significant progress toward gender parity, according to the report?**

(a)  Economic Participation and Opportunity
(b)  Educational Attainment
(c)  Political Empowerment
(d)  Health and Survival


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question asks about the dimension showing the greatest progress. The passage states that the Health and Survival gender gap had closed by 96%, a considerably higher percentage than the other dimensions.  While progress in other areas is important, the question specifically seeks the dimension with *most* significant progress.  The substantial closing of the Health and Survival gap makes it the most appropriate answer.


**7. According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024,  India's ranking among 146 countries reflects its standing in terms of gender parity.  In which South Asian country did India rank 5th?**

(a)  Pakistan
(b)  Bangladesh
(c)  Sri Lanka
(d)  Afghanistan


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on India's relative ranking within South Asia. The provided text explicitly states that India ranked 5th in South Asia, after Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan.  Therefore, Bangladesh is the correct answer.  The other options are also South Asian countries, but they do not accurately reflect India's relative position described in the text.


**8. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 introduced new categories for ranking educational institutions. Which of the following is NOT one of the new categories added in NIRF 2024?**

(a)  Open Universities
(b)  Private Universities
(c)  State Public Universities
(d)  Skill Universities


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question identifies the new categories introduced in NIRF 2024. The provided text mentions Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities as new additions.  Private universities were already included in previous NIRF rankings.  Therefore, Private Universities is the only option not included as a newly added category.

Student Satisfaction is not included in the mentioned five key areas.  Therefore, Student Satisfaction is the correct answer.


**10.  The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced annually by which organization?**

(a)  The World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  The Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
(d)  The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question asks about the producer of the GRFC.  The text explicitly states that the Food Security Information Network (FSIN) produces the report annually.  While the WFP and FAO are involved in the GNAFC, the GRFC is specifically attributed to the FSIN.  The GNAFC is an overarching initiative that works to address food crises, but it's not the direct producer of the GRFC report. Therefore, only FSIN is correct.



**1.  A global initiative launched to combat hunger and poverty, while simultaneously addressing inequalities, was announced at a significant international summit in 2024.  This initiative involves a collaborative framework with multiple pillars and a diverse membership base. Which of the following correctly identifies this initiative, its primary aim, and a key characteristic of its structure?**

(a) The World Food Programme; to provide food aid globally; a hierarchical structure focused on efficient distribution.
(b) The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty; to eradicate hunger and poverty, reducing inequalities; a three-pillar structure acting as a neutral facilitator.
(c) The Rome Declaration on Nutrition; to commit countries to eradicate hunger and prevent malnutrition; a decentralized structure emphasizing national ownership.
(d) The Zero Hunger Challenge; to ensure everyone has adequate nutrition; a centralized structure driven by UN leadership.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in Brazil, directly addresses the question's description. Its aim is explicitly stated as supporting and accelerating efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty (SDGs 1 and 2) while reducing inequalities (SDG 10).  The "three pillars — National, Financial, and Knowledge" structure and its role as a "neutral facilitator" are also key characteristics mentioned in the source material. Option (a) describes the World Food Programme, which is a related but distinct entity focused on food aid.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (snippets of text on diverse topics), some questions may appear less interconnected than in a typical exam paper.


**1.  A crucial set of amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, was recently agreed upon.  Which of the following is NOT a key amendment adopted at the 77th World Health Assembly?**

(a) A clearer definition of a pandemic emergency, including criteria related to geographical spread and national health system capacity.
(b) The establishment of a new global fund dedicated solely to the development of novel antiviral medications.
(c) The creation of a States Parties Committee to oversee the effective implementation of the IHR.
(d) The establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism to support developing countries.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options (a), (c), and (d) accurately reflect key amendments to the IHR, 2005, as discussed in the provided text.  The amendments aim to improve global preparedness and response to public health emergencies.  Option (b), however, is incorrect. While the amendments address financial mechanisms and international cooperation, they do not specifically create a global fund dedicated solely to the development of new antiviral medications. The focus is on strengthening existing mechanisms and improving coordination for a more effective response to future pandemics.  The existing mechanisms, and improved coordination, are intended to facilitate the development and distribution of necessary medical countermeasures, but not through a dedicated new fund as stated in option (b).  This highlights the nuanced difference between facilitating development and creating a specifically dedicated fund.

Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills relevant to the UPSC exam.  Each question is accompanied by a detailed explanation.


**1.  Which tribal group in Odisha, recognized as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG),  holds habitat rights as defined by the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA)?**

(a)  The Bharias of Madhya Pradesh
(b)  The Kamars of Chhattisgarh
(c)  The Paudi Bhuyans of Deogarh, Odisha
(d) The Maria Gond of Maharashtra

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question specifically asks about a PVTG in Odisha with habitat rights under the FRA. While options (a), (b), and (d) mention PVTGs, they are not located in Odisha. The text explicitly states that the Paudi Bhuyans of Deogarh, Odisha, are among the tribes with habitat rights. This demonstrates factual recall and requires careful reading to identify the correct geographic location.  The other options are plausible distractors, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between different tribal groups and their locations.  Understanding the FRA and its application to PVTGs is crucial for a correct answer, showcasing conceptual understanding and application of legal knowledge in a socio-environmental context.


**2.  The ‘Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)’ Scheme, a centrally sponsored initiative, primarily aims to achieve which of the following objectives?**

(a)  Complete assimilation of PVTGs into mainstream society, promoting rapid modernization.
(b)  Exclusive focus on improving literacy rates among PVTGs, disregarding other socio-economic factors.
(c)  Comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs while preserving their cultural heritage.
(d)  Relocation of all PVTGs to urban areas to provide access to better infrastructure and opportunities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question tests conceptual understanding of the PVTG development scheme. Option (c) accurately reflects the stated aim of the scheme: holistic development while respecting and maintaining the unique cultural identity of PVTGs. Options (a) and (d) represent misconceptions, as the scheme emphasizes empowerment within their communities, not assimilation or forced relocation. Option (b) is too narrow, as the scheme addresses a broader range of socio-economic factors, not just literacy.  This question assesses the candidate's ability to understand government policies targeting vulnerable populations and their underlying philosophies.


**3.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a)  Forest-based livelihoods
(b)  Pre-agricultural level of existence
(c)  High literacy rates and access to education

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question assesses factual recall and the ability to identify exceptions.  The text clearly lists the criteria for identifying PVTGs; low literacy and a subsistence economy are key features. Option (c) directly contradicts this, making it the correct answer.  The other options are all correctly listed criteria, serving as plausible distractors that test the candidate's knowledge of the specific characteristics used to define PVTGs.  This highlights the importance of understanding the specific criteria used in government classifications of vulnerable groups.


**4.  The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) initiative primarily focuses on which of the following aspects?**

(a)  Providing financial assistance to non-tribal communities in rural areas.
(b)  Improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities through integrated development.
(c)  Implementing large-scale industrial projects in tribal areas to boost economic growth.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on science and technology, with detailed explanations:


**1.  A government initiative aims to comprehensively improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities while preserving their cultural heritage.  This initiative utilizes existing development grants and involves multiple ministries in implementing 25 interventions across 63,000 villages. Which initiative best fits this description?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(c)  National Food Security Act (NFSA)
(d)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) directly addresses the socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities.  Its core objective is to bridge critical gaps in infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through a multi-pronged approach involving various ministries and leveraging existing funding mechanisms like the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST).  The scheme's emphasis on comprehensive development while preserving cultural heritage aligns perfectly with the description.  Options (a), (c), and (d) focus on financial inclusion, food security, and education respectively, while PM-JUGA is a holistic initiative encompassing these aspects along with infrastructure development and livelihood support tailored specifically for tribal communities.  The mention of 25 interventions and coverage across 63,000 villages further reinforces the correct answer.


**2.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006 grants specific rights related to customary habitats. Which of the following best describes the scope of these habitat rights as defined by the FRA?**

(a)  Exclusive ownership of all forest land traditionally used by tribal communities.
(b)  Unrestricted access to all forest resources, regardless of ecological considerations.
(c)  Rights encompassing customary habitats and other habitats within reserved and protected forests for specified tribal groups.
(d)  Limited access to forest products for personal consumption only.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FRA's definition of habitat rights specifically includes the customary habitat and other habitats within reserved and protected forests for primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.  This implies a recognition of traditional land use and access rights, but within the framework of existing forest regulations. Option (a) is incorrect as it implies full ownership, whereas FRA accords rights, not absolute ownership.  Option (b) is incorrect because it disregards ecological concerns; the FRA aims for sustainable resource management.  Option (d) is too restrictive, as the habitat rights encompass more than mere personal consumption.  The key here is understanding the FRA's nuanced approach: it balances the rights of tribal communities with the need for forest conservation.


**3. Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  Forest-based livelihoods
(b)  High literacy rates
(c)  Pre-agricultural level of existence
(d)  A stagnant or declining population


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The criteria for identifying PVTGs emphasize vulnerability and socio-economic backwardness.  High literacy rates directly contradict this; PVTGs are characterized by low literacy levels.  Options (a), (c), and (d) accurately reflect the characteristics used to identify PVTGs: dependence on forests, a pre-agricultural lifestyle, and population stagnation or decline all signify vulnerability and limited access to modern development.  The contrast between high literacy (option b) and the overall characteristics of PVTGs makes it the clear outlier.


**4. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) report highlights several interconnected factors contributing to global hunger. Which of the following is NOT a key factor emphasized by the GHI report?**

(a) Gender inequality
(b) Climate change
(c)  Technological advancements in agriculture
(d) Maternal malnutrition


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GHI report directly links gender inequality, climate change, and maternal malnutrition to global hunger.  These factors exacerbate food insecurity and malnutrition, especially for vulnerable populations. Technological advancements in agriculture, while potentially beneficial, are not explicitly identified as a key contributing factor to the *severity* of hunger in the GHI's analysis.  The report focuses on the negative impacts of the other factors, showing how they hinder progress towards achieving Zero Hunger by 2030.  The absence of technological advancements as a primary contributing factor to the problem, as opposed to a potential solution, makes it the correct answer.


**5.  A Swiss-based NGO works to address malnutrition by supporting public-private partnerships focused on increasing access to essential nutrients.  Which organization best fits this description?**

(a)  UNICEF
(b)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(c)  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) directly aligns with the description.  GAIN's mission is to tackle malnutrition through public-private partnerships, focusing on improving access to essential nutrients in diets.  While UNICEF, WFP, and FAO address food security and nutrition, GAIN's specific focus on nutrient deficiencies and its use of public-private partnerships differentiate it from the others.  The other options have broader mandates encompassing food security, aid, or agricultural development, but not the precise focus on nutrient access through public-private collaboration that defines GAIN.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report, launched by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) with WRAP, tracks global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels.  It directly supports SDG 12.3.1 (b), which aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030. The FAO is the custodian of SDG 12.3.1 (a), focusing on reducing food loss along production and supply chains.  SDG 2.1 relates to ending hunger, and SDG 12.3.2 is not directly related to the FWI.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of international organizations and their roles in addressing global challenges.


**2.  The Indian government launched a virtual assessment program and a streamlined licensing initiative to improve healthcare access. What are the names of these initiatives, and which ministry is responsible for them?**

(a)  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission and e-Sanjeevani; Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology
(b)  NQAS Assessment and Spot Food License Initiative; Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(c)  National Health Mission and National Rural Health Mission; Ministry of Panchayati Raj
(d)  e-Hospital and National Telemedicine Service; Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched the NQAS (National Quality Assurance Standards) Assessment for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs) and the Spot Food License Initiative through the Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS). The other options present related healthcare initiatives but are not the ones described in the text.  This question assesses factual recall of specific government programs and their implementing ministries.


**3.  A report highlights the potential of investments in nutritious food value chains to reduce gender inequalities and enhance business resilience.  Which organization published this report, and what is its primary focus?**

(a)  The World Bank;  Global food security
(b)  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization; Sustainable agriculture practices
(c)  GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition);  Nutrition investments and gender impact
(d)  IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute);  Agricultural productivity

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) published the report titled ‘The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains: An Opportunity for Gender Impact.’ The report's core focus is on demonstrating how investments in nutritious food systems can concurrently address gender inequalities, boost productivity, and enhance the resilience of businesses involved in the agri-food sector. The other organizations address related topics, but not this specific report and its focus on gender. This question tests conceptual understanding and the ability to link organizations to their specific initiatives.


**4. A report analyzes the financing needed to eliminate hunger and malnutrition globally. Which report is this, and what is its key finding regarding the achievement of a specific Sustainable Development Goal?**

(a)  The Global Hunger Index;  India's ranking has improved.
(b)  The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report; The world is far from achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger).
(c)  The Food Waste Index Report; Food waste contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.
(d)  The Global Report on Food Crises;  The number of people facing acute food insecurity is increasing.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, focuses on the financing needed to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition. A key finding is that the world is significantly behind schedule in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger). The other reports address related issues but do not focus on the financing for food security and malnutrition and SDG 2 specifically. This question tests factual recall and the ability to connect reports with their central themes and conclusions.


**5. An initiative aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India by addressing critical gaps in infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods. Which initiative is this and what is its namesake?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana;  Mahatma Gandhi
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi;  Charaka
(c)  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA); Birsa Munda
(d)  National Rural Livelihoods Mission;  Deendayal Upadhyaya

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  It is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known for his resistance against British rule. The other options are government schemes but do not have the focus on tribal upliftment and the namesake as specified.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to associate schemes with their objectives and namesakes.


**6.  Two international organizations launched a report highlighting the severity of global hunger and its links to gender inequality and climate change. What are the names of these organizations, and what is the name of their report?**

(a)  The World Food Programme and UNICEF;  The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report
(b)  Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe;  Global Hunger Index
(c)  FAO and IFAD;  Global Report on Food Crises
(d)  GAIN and IFPRI;  The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, two non-governmental organizations, released the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024.  The report highlights the alarming levels of hunger globally and its connections to gender inequality and the impacts of climate change.  The other options list other reports and organizations focusing on food security and nutrition but not this specific report and its producing organizations.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to associate reports with their publishers and key findings.


**1.  A governmental initiative aims to enhance the socioeconomic standing of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergent schemes and outreach.  Which of the following accurately describes this initiative?**

(a)  National Health Mission (NHM) focusing on improved healthcare access for Scheduled Tribes.
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), a five-year plan covering over 63,000 villages.
(c)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, concentrating on universalizing access to quality education for tribal students.
(d)  The Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST), allocating funds under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is explicitly designed to improve the socioeconomic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps across various sectors.  Option (a) is incorrect because while the NHM does include components beneficial to Scheduled Tribes, it's not the overarching initiative described. Option (c) focuses solely on education, while PM-JUGA has a broader scope. Option (d) correctly identifies a funding mechanism but not the specific initiative itself; DAPST funds are used *within* PM-JUGA, but it is not the program's name or primary objective.  PM-JUGA's comprehensive approach, five-year timeframe, and expansive village coverage distinguish it as the correct answer.  The question highlights the initiative's multi-sectoral approach and the scale of its implementation, making it a challenging yet relevant UPSC-style question.


**2.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006 grants specific rights to certain tribal groups.  Which of the following accurately defines the type of right granted under Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA and the groups it covers?**

(a)  Livelihood rights, granted to all Scheduled Tribes residing in forest areas.
(b)  Land ownership rights, specifically granted to pre-agricultural communities in reserved forests.
(c)  Habitat rights, granted to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.
(d)  Grazing rights, granted to all forest-dwelling communities for traditional livestock rearing.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA explicitly deals with habitat rights. These rights are not limited to land ownership (b) but encompass the customary habitat and other related areas in reserved and protected forests.  The FRA's intent is to protect the traditional way of life of these communities, not just land ownership.  The rights are also not limited to all Scheduled Tribes (a) or solely focused on grazing (d).  The crucial element is that these habitat rights are specifically granted to PVTGs and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes, making (c) the accurate and comprehensive answer.  The question tests knowledge of a specific legal provision and its application to a particular category of tribal groups, aligning with the demanding nature of UPSC examinations.


**3.  A Swiss-based NGO works to alleviate malnutrition globally by fostering public-private partnerships to increase access to essential nutrients. Which of the following organizations best fits this description?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d)  United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) directly addresses malnutrition through its public-private partnership model, focused on improving dietary nutrient intake. The WFP (a) primarily focuses on food distribution and emergency relief, while the FAO (b) deals with broader agricultural and food security issues. UNICEF (d) concentrates on children's well-being, including nutrition, but does not solely focus on this through the described mechanism. GAIN's specific approach of leveraging public-private partnerships to tackle micronutrient deficiencies makes it the organization that best aligns with the description provided. The question requires a precise understanding of different international organizations and their specific mandates, making it suitable for UPSC-level assessments.


**4. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) aims to cultivate a culture of research and innovation across India.  Which of the following best describes a key initiative under ANRF designed to foster mentorship and collaboration between established and emerging research institutions?**

(a)  Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(b)  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)
(c)  Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(d)  Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) initiative specifically focuses on pairing universities with nascent research capabilities with established top-tier institutions to provide mentorship and support.  MAHA (a) focuses on supporting research in specific high-impact areas, while ACE (b) aims to establish world-class research centers. SERB (d), while relevant to research funding, is no longer a separate entity but has been subsumed into ANRF. PAIR's unique hub-and-spoke model of mentorship and collaboration makes it the accurate response. The question assesses knowledge of specific programs within a larger governmental initiative, aligning with the analytical and factual recall skills required in UPSC-style examinations.


**5.  A specific Act established a regulatory body in 2018 to oversee compliance with high standards in financial reporting and auditing, primarily for large companies and certain classes of companies in India.  Which Act established this regulatory body?**

(a)  The Reserve Bank of India Act
(b)  The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act
(c)  The Companies Act, 2013
(d)  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) was established under Section 132(1) of the Companies Act, 2013.  The RBI Act (a) governs the central bank, SEBI Act (b) regulates the securities market, and the IBC (d) deals with insolvency resolution. Only the Companies Act, 2013, directly addresses the establishment of a regulatory body focused on financial reporting and auditing standards for companies in India.  The question tests knowledge of specific legislation and the regulatory bodies established under it, a common theme in UPSC-style examinations.  It demands precise factual recall and understanding of Indian regulatory frameworks.


**1.  A governmental initiative aims to comprehensively enhance the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, emphasizing the saturation of critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergent schemes.  What is the name of this initiative?**

(a)  PM-JANMAN
(b)  National Health Accounts Estimates
(c)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(d)  Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is explicitly described as an initiative aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergent schemes.  PM-JANMAN is mentioned as a source of learnings for PM-JUGA, not the initiative itself.  National Health Accounts Estimates focus on financial flows within the health system, and DAPST is a funding mechanism, not a comprehensive socio-economic development program.  Therefore, only PM-JUGA accurately fits the description.


**2. Which Act legally empowers the granting of habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b)  The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996
(c)  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006
(d)  The National Food Security Act, 2013

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) specifically mentions the provision of habitat rights to PVTGs under Section 3(1)(e). The other acts address different aspects of tribal welfare, such as preventing atrocities, extending panchayat powers to scheduled areas, or ensuring food security, but not habitat rights.  The FRA is the only legislation directly addressing this specific right.


**3.  A centrally sponsored scheme aims for the comprehensive socio-economic development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) while preserving their cultural heritage.  What is the name of this scheme?**

(a)  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
(b)  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme
(c)  Skill India Mission
(d)  Swadesh Darshan

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme" is explicitly described as a centrally sponsored scheme aiming for the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs while preserving their culture and heritage.  The other options represent individual components or related initiatives but not the overarching scheme dedicated to PVTG development.


**4. The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India are found in which state?**

(a)  Madhya Pradesh
(b)  Chhattisgarh
(c)  Maharashtra
(d)  Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, the highest among all states and Union Territories. While other states like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have PVTGs, Odisha has the largest number according to the provided information.


**5. Which organization publishes the World University Rankings, which in 2025 included 2,092 ranked universities from 115 countries and territories, using 18 indicators across five key areas?**

(a)  Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)
(b)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
(c)  Times Higher Education (THE)
(d)  National Board of Accreditation (NBA)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly attributes the 2025 World University Rankings with the described characteristics to Times Higher Education (THE).  QS publishes its own university rankings, NIRF is an Indian ranking framework, and NBA is an accreditation body, none of which match the description of the global ranking mentioned.


**6.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) uses several parameters to rank educational institutions. Which of the following is NOT one of those parameters?**

(a)  Teaching, Learning, and Resources
(b)  Research and Professional Practices
(c)  Financial Sustainability
(d)  Graduation Outcomes

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NIRF parameters are explicitly listed as Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.  Financial sustainability is not mentioned as a ranking parameter.


**7.  A new initiative aims to instantly issue food licenses and registrations through a pan-India IT platform.  What is the name of this initiative?**

(a)  Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM)
(b)  Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL)
(c)  Spot Food License Initiative
(d)  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage directly describes the "Spot Food License Initiative" as aiming for instant issuance of licenses and registrations via the Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS). The other options are related to healthcare quality assessment, not food licensing.


**8.  The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report, launched by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP, tracks food waste at which levels?**

(a)  Only at the household level
(b)  Only at the production level
(c)  Retail and consumer levels (household and food service)
(d)  Only at the retail level

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the FWI tracks food waste at the retail and consumer levels, encompassing both household and food service sectors.  The other options are incomplete or incorrect representations of the FWI's scope.


**9.  What is the primary objective of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)?**

(a)  To provide financial assistance to persons with disabilities.
(b)  To promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.
(c)  To establish special schools for persons with disabilities.
(d)  To create job reservation policies for persons with disabilities.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the UN-CRPD's objective is to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.  The other options are not the primary or overarching objective of the convention.


**10. Which committee's recommendations formed the basis for the government's recognition of 75 Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  The Mandal Commission
(b)  The Sarkaria Commission
(c)  The Dhebar Committee
(d)  The Sachar Committee

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The text explicitly states that the government recognized 75 PVTGs based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Committee (1960-61). The other committees focused on different aspects of social justice and governance.


**1.  Which Act mandates the appointment of Child Marriage Prohibition Officers (CMPOs) to prevent child marriages and what is its primary objective?**

(a) The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015; to provide care and protection to children at risk of marriage.
(b) The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006; to prohibit the solemnization of child marriages and provide relief to victims.
(c) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016; to prohibit child labor in all occupations.
(d) Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme (2015); to break gender stereotypes and prevent child marriages.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006, explicitly mandates the appointment of Child Marriage Prohibition Officers (CMPOs) in every state to prevent child marriages, ensure victim protection, and prosecute offenders.  Its primary objective, as stated in the provided text, is to prohibit the solemnization of child marriages and provide relief to victims, enhancing punishment for those who abet, promote, or solemnize such marriages. Option (a) focuses on the care and protection of children at risk, but not specifically on the appointment of CMPOs or the direct prohibition of child marriage. Option (c) addresses child labor, a separate issue. Option (d) aims to break gender stereotypes and prevent child marriages but doesn't involve the appointment of CMPOs or the direct legal prohibition of child marriage as its central focus.  The PCMA, 2006, provides the specific legal framework and enforcement mechanism through the CMPOs, making it the most accurate answer.


**2.  What legal recourse is available under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, for a child who was married while underage?**

(a)  Immediate imprisonment of the perpetrators.
(b)  Automatic annulment of the marriage irrespective of the time elapsed.
(c)  Annulment of the marriage within two years of attaining majority.
(d)  Reporting to the Child Welfare Committee only.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The PCMA, 2006 allows for the annulment of a child marriage, but this can be sought only within two years of the child involved attaining majority (legal adulthood).  Option (a) is incorrect; while the act provides for punishment of offenders, it doesn't guarantee immediate imprisonment. Option (b) is incorrect as the annulment isn't automatic; it requires action by the affected party within the specified timeframe. Option (d) is incorrect because while reporting to the Child Welfare Committee is a possibility, it's not the sole or exclusive legal recourse.  The two-year window for seeking annulment is a crucial element of the act, reflecting the balance between protecting the child's rights and acknowledging the complexities of such situations.


**3. Which Act provides for the care and protection of children who are at imminent risk of marriage before attaining the legal age of marriage?**

(a)  The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006.
(b)  The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961.
(c)  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.
(d)  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, specifically addresses the care and protection of children at risk of child marriage.  The PCMA, 2006 focuses on prohibiting child marriage and providing relief to victims but doesn't explicitly detail the care and protection mechanisms. The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, deals with maternity leave for women workers. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, regulates ART procedures. Therefore, only the Juvenile Justice Act directly addresses the preemptive care and protection of children vulnerable to child marriage, making it the correct option.


**4.  Besides the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, which other scheme aims to prevent child marriages in India?**

(a)  The National Action Plan to Prevent Child Marriage.
(b)  The Accessible India Campaign.
(c)  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA).
(d)  The Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Action Plan to Prevent Child Marriage is explicitly mentioned in the provided text as a comprehensive framework designed to support girls at risk of early marriage.  The Accessible India Campaign focuses on accessibility for people with disabilities. Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. The Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992, relates to the rehabilitation of people with disabilities.  Therefore, only the National Action Plan directly addresses the prevention of child marriage, complementing the efforts of the PCMA, 2006.


**5.  What action did the Supreme Court take in the Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action v. UoI case concerning the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006?**

(a)  Declared the Act unconstitutional.
(b)  Ruled that the Act could be superseded by personal laws and traditions.
(c)  Held that the PCMA cannot be undermined by personal laws and traditions.
(d)  Extended the age of marriage for women to 21 years.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court's ruling in the Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action v. UoI case emphasized that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCMA), cannot be overridden by personal laws or traditions. This reinforces the supremacy of the law in preventing child marriages, irrespective of cultural or religious practices that might condone them. Options (a) and (b) contradict the court's actual decision. Option (d) is incorrect; while there have been discussions and legislative actions regarding raising the marriage age, this specific case did not address that issue.  The court's decision in this case underscores the importance of upholding the PCMA as a crucial legal instrument in protecting children from forced marriages.


**6. Which court case dealt with the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015's provision for the preliminary assessment of children in conflict with the law (CCL) in heinous offences?**

(a)  Hiral P Harsora and ors Vs. Kusum Narottamdas Harsora & Ors Case
(b)  Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India case
(c)  Child in Conflict with Law (CCL) through his mother v. State of Karnataka
(d)  Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action v. UoI Case

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court's judgment in "Child in Conflict with Law (CCL) through his mother v. State of Karnataka" directly addressed the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, specifically concerning the preliminary assessment of CCL in heinous offences.  The other cases mentioned deal with different legal matters: domestic violence, surrogacy, and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act respectively.  Therefore, only the "Child in Conflict with Law" case is directly relevant to the question's focus on the Juvenile Justice Act and its application in cases involving heinous crimes committed by minors.


**7.  The 77th World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting resulted in amendments to which international health regulations?**

(a)  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971.
(b)  The International Sanitary Regulations (1951).
(c)  The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005.
(d)  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 77th WHA meeting focused on amending the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, which is a legally binding framework for handling public health emergencies.  The other options are unrelated to international health regulations; the MTP Act deals with abortion, the 1951 regulations are superseded by the IHR 2005, and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita is an Indian legal code. The IHR, 2005, is the only set of regulations explicitly mentioned as being amended in the provided text, making it the correct answer.  The amendments highlight the need for improved global cooperation in addressing pandemics and other public health crises.


**8. What is the key change introduced by the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, concerning paid maternity leave?**

(a)  Reduction of paid maternity leave.
(b)  Introduction of paid paternity leave.
(c)  Extension of paid maternity leave to 26 weeks for women with less than two surviving children.
(d)  Elimination of paid maternity leave for contractual employees.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, significantly increased paid maternity leave to 26 weeks for women with fewer than two surviving children.  Options (a) and (d) are incorrect; the amendment expanded, not reduced, maternity benefits, and it applies to contractual employees as well, according to a Madras High Court ruling. Option (b) is incorrect as the amendment did not introduce paid paternity leave. The extension of leave to 26 weeks is a key feature of the amendment, reflecting a greater emphasis on supporting women in the workplace and promoting better maternal and child health outcomes.


**9.  Under which Article of the Constitution does the Supreme Court's directive on denying women Child Care Leave (CCL) being a violation of the Constitution fall?**

(a) Article 263
(b) Article 142
(c) Article 300A
(d) Article 15

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court's decision linking the denial of Child Care Leave (CCL) to a constitutional violation is based on Article 15, which prohibits discrimination based on sex.  Article 263 deals with the Inter-State Council, Article 142 concerns the Supreme Court's inherent powers, and Article 300A relates to the right to property.  Only Article 15 directly addresses the issue of gender equality and discrimination, making it the relevant constitutional basis for the court's ruling on CCL.  The court's emphasis on Article 15 highlights the importance of ensuring equal opportunities for women in the workplace and recognizing the need for policies that support their roles as caregivers.


**10.  What is the legal age of marriage for females in India, as defined by the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006?**

(a) 21 years
(b) 18 years
(c) 20 years
(d) 16 years

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, defines the legal age of marriage for females in India as 18 years.  The other options are incorrect; the legal age is not 21, 20, or 16 years.  This legal definition is central to the act's aim of preventing child marriages and protecting the rights and well-being of young girls.  The 18-year age limit aligns with international standards and recognizes the importance of allowing girls to reach adulthood and make informed decisions about their futures before entering into marriage.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the subject matter.


**1.  A global initiative launched in Davos 2024, endorsed by the World Economic Forum and India, aims to pool global best practices, knowledge sharing, and investments in women's health, education, and enterprise. What is the name of this initiative?**

(a)  The Global Partnership for Women's Advancement
(b)  The Women's Empowerment and Development Alliance
(c)  The Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality
(d)  The International Consortium for Women's Rights

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly refers to the "Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality,"  launched in Davos 2024 with the backing of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and India.  The initiative's core objective aligns precisely with the description provided – to bring together global best practices, knowledge sharing, and investments in women's health, education, and enterprise.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are plausible distractors, representing potential initiatives that could exist but do not match the specific details outlined in the source material.  Understanding the precise name and the context of the launch (Davos 2024, WEF endorsement) is crucial for answering this question correctly.  The question tests factual recall and requires precise knowledge of global initiatives related to gender equity.


**2.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to address critical gaps in several sectors for the betterment of tribal communities. Which of the following is NOT a primary focus area of this scheme?**

(a)  Improving infrastructure in government residential schools and hostels.
(b)  Promoting sustainable livelihoods for forest right holders.
(c)  Enhancing access to advanced medical technology for diagnosing specific diseases like Sickle Cell Disease.
(d)  Providing free higher education opportunities to all tribal students.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  PM-JUGA focuses on improving socio-economic conditions through convergence and outreach across various sectors, including infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods.  While the scheme aims to enhance education access (Goal 3 mentions increasing GER), it does not promise free higher education for *all* tribal students. The other options (a, b, and c) are all explicitly mentioned as components of PM-JUGA's interventions. This question tests the candidate's ability to discern the specific focus areas of a government scheme from a broader description, demanding detailed understanding and precise recall.  The inclusion of plausible distractors like (a), (b), and (c) makes this a difficult question.


**3.  Which international convention, adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities?**

(a)  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(b)  The Convention on the Rights of the Child
(c)  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)
(d)  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly asks about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD). The other options are important international human rights instruments, but they do not specifically address the rights of persons with disabilities in the comprehensive manner described.  The question tests factual recall and requires knowledge of specific international human rights conventions.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options (a, b, and d) which are related to human rights but do not pertain to disability rights directly, increases the difficulty level.


**4.  The 77th World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting concluded with agreements on amendments to which key international health framework?**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on science and technology, along with detailed explanations:


**1.  A government initiative aims to bridge critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities, drawing inspiration from a previous successful program.  This initiative, named after a renowned tribal leader who resisted British rule, spans five years and targets over 5 crore people across numerous villages. Which of the following statements accurately describes this initiative?**

(a) It exclusively focuses on providing financial aid to tribal families.
(b) Its implementation relies solely on newly allocated funds.
(c) It involves a comprehensive strategy with multiple interventions across various ministries.
(d) It primarily concentrates on improving agricultural productivity in tribal regions.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA). Option (c) is correct because PM-JUGA's core objective is a multi-pronged approach encompassing various sectors through the convergence of existing schemes and outreach programs.  It leverages existing funds under the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) and involves 17 line ministries for its implementation.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they present oversimplified or incomplete views of the initiative.  PM-JUGA is not limited to financial aid; it focuses on holistic development.  It utilizes existing DAPST funds, not exclusively new allocations.  While agricultural improvement is a component, it's not the sole focus; the program addresses multiple aspects of socio-economic upliftment.  The comprehensive and multi-sectoral nature of PM-JUGA is crucial to understanding its significance in addressing the complex challenges faced by tribal communities.

This process is crucial for addressing diverse learning pathways and enhancing educational inclusivity. Which term best describes this mechanism?**

(a)  Skill India Mission
(b)  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)
(c)  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)
(d)  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description perfectly aligns with Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). RPL formally acknowledges skills and knowledge gained outside traditional educational settings, allowing individuals to receive credit for their experience. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. The Skill India Mission focuses on skill development, ABC stores academic credits, and NETF promotes technology in education; none directly address the formal recognition of prior learning from diverse sources as described.  RPL is a key component of inclusive education policies globally, ensuring that individuals with non-traditional learning pathways can access further education and professional opportunities.  This aligns with the broader goal of equitable access to higher education, a critical aspect of social development.


**3. The establishment of a campus in India by a foreign higher educational institution (FHEI) is guided by specific regulations that aim to introduce an international dimension to higher education in India.  This move follows the principles outlined in a recent national education policy.

(a)  The FHEI must be a member of an international university consortium.
(b)  The FHEI must offer courses exclusively in English.
(c)  The FHEI must be ranked among the top 500 globally, either overall or in relevant subject areas.
(d)  The FHEI must have a significant endowment exceeding a specified amount.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023.  Option (c) correctly identifies the primary criterion: the FHEI must be ranked among the top 500 globally, reflecting the policy's aim to attract high-quality institutions.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.  While collaboration might be beneficial, it's not a mandatory criterion.  Language of instruction is not a specified requirement.  Endowment size is not a stated criterion for establishing a campus in India.  The ranking criterion ensures a standard of excellence and enhances the quality of higher education in India, aligning with the overall goals of the National Education Policy 2020.

Which of the following best describes this organization's framework?**

(a)  The Biwako Millennium Framework
(b)  The National Health Accounts Estimates
(c)  The Global Hunger Index
(d)  The National Institutional Ranking Framework


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The question points to the Biwako Millennium Framework, which explicitly focuses on disability inclusion within a rights-based framework, aligning with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD). Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect.  National Health Accounts Estimates track financial flows in the health sector; the Global Hunger Index measures hunger levels; and the National Institutional Ranking Framework ranks educational institutions. None of these directly relate to the promotion of rights and inclusion for people with disabilities as described. The Biwako Millennium Framework's importance lies in its comprehensive approach to promoting disability inclusion, reflecting a broader global commitment to social justice and equity.

The focus is on inclusive development and empowerment, not restriction.


**3. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) defines ‘habitat’ as:**

(a)  Any area inhabited by tribal communities, regardless of its legal status.
(b)  Only reserved forests occupied by Scheduled Tribes.
(c)  The area comprising the customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling STs.
(d)  Land exclusively owned by tribal communities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text directly defines the FRA's understanding of 'habitat' as encompassing customary habitats and other habitats within reserved and protected forests specifically for primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes. Options (a) and (d) are too broad, while (b) is too narrow.  The FRA's definition is crucial because it establishes the legal basis for habitat rights, recognizing the historical and customary connection of tribal communities to forest lands.  This legal recognition is a significant step towards securing the rights and livelihoods of forest-dwelling tribal populations.


**4.  Which of the following statements about Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) is INCORRECT?**

(a)  PVTGs are identified based on criteria including forest-based livelihoods and a declining population.
(b)  Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs among all states and UTs.
(c)  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme provides 50% central assistance.
(d)  The Dhebar Committee's recommendations informed the government's recognition of PVTGs.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text states that the 'Development of PVTGs' Scheme provides 100% central assistance, not 50%. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect information presented about PVTGs.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs focus on their vulnerability and dependence on forest resources, often characterized by pre-agricultural lifestyles, declining populations, and low literacy rates.  The Dhebar Committee played a significant role in identifying and defining PVTGs, highlighting the historical context of their recognition.

(a)  Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality
(b)  Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty
(c)  Zero Hunger Challenge
(d)  Rome Declaration on Nutrition


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty directly addresses the eradication of hunger and poverty, alongside inequality reduction. Its use of a Policy Basket to facilitate partnerships and resource mobilization aligns with the description.  The Alliance for Global Good focuses on gender equity, not directly on hunger and poverty eradication. The Zero Hunger Challenge is a broader UN initiative, lacking the specific structure and launch described. The Rome Declaration is a commitment document, not an operational initiative.  This question tests the ability to differentiate between various international initiatives related to global development goals and requires knowledge of recent G20 outcomes.

(b)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  UN Women
(d)  GAIN


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) precisely matches this description.  Its focus on public-private partnerships to increase access to essential nutrients aligns directly with the question.  The WFP and FAO address broader food security issues, while UN Women focuses on gender equality.  This tests knowledge of international organizations working in the nutrition sector and requires the ability to pinpoint specific organizational mandates.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is followed by a detailed explanation.

(b) The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
(c) State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report
(d) Food Waste Index Report 2024

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the description perfectly matches the definition of financing for food security and nutrition as presented in the "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024".  This report specifically addresses the financial aspects of achieving food security and nutrition goals, covering availability, access, utilization, and stability of food, along with the strengthening of agri-food systems.  Option (a), the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, while related to hunger eradication, doesn't focus specifically on the financing aspect as comprehensively as the State of Food Security and Nutrition report. Option (b), GNAFC, focuses on addressing the root causes of food crises, not the financial mechanisms involved. Option (d), the Food Waste Index Report, deals with a specific aspect of food security—waste—but not the broader financial mechanisms for achieving food security and nutrition goals.  The question cleverly uses a detailed description to make the correct answer less obvious.


**2.

(a)  Education
(b)  Housing
(c)  Establishment of large-scale industrial units in tribal areas.
(d)  Agricultural development

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage lists education, housing, and agricultural development as activities funded by the scheme.  The establishment of large-scale industrial units is not mentioned and would likely contradict the scheme's focus on sustainable and culturally sensitive development of PVTGs.  This question tests the understanding of the scheme's objectives and activities.


**9. Which act recognizes the right to food as a statutory right in India?**

(a)  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006
(b)  The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013
(c)  The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana Act
(d)  The POSHAN Abhiyan Act

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, is explicitly mentioned in the text as recognizing the right to food as a statutory right.  The other options are related to other aspects of social welfare and development but do not focus on the legal recognition of the right to food.  This question tests factual recall of Indian legislation.


**10. The draft guidelines released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, concerning the withdrawal of life support in terminally ill patients, relate to which practice?**

(a) Active Euthanasia
(b) Passive Euthanasia
(c) Physician-Assisted Suicide
(d) Palliative Care

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that the guidelines relate to "Passive Euthanasia," the withdrawal of life support. Active euthanasia involves actively ending a life, while physician-assisted suicide involves providing the means for a patient to end their own life.  Palliative care focuses on symptom management.  This question tests understanding of medical terminology and current events.




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  A digital pension system streamlining pension-related processes for Defence Pensioners, addressing the need for accessible facilitation points across the country, is best described by which of the following names?**

(a) SARTHIE 1.0

(c) International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005
(d)  The National Anti-Doping Act, 2022

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description clearly matches the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005.  The IHR is a legally binding framework for managing international public health crises.  The other options are unrelated; the Lausanne Declaration focuses on doping in sports, the GGGI on gender equality, and the National Anti-Doping Act on domestic anti-doping measures. This question tests understanding of international health regulations and their significance in global health governance, a topic relevant to UPSC exams.  A strong understanding of international treaties and agreements is essential for UPSC success.

(a)  Birsa Munda
(b)  Mahatma Gandhi
(c)  Subhas Chandra Bose
(d)  Bhagat Singh

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that PM-JUGA is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known for his resistance against British rule.  The other options are prominent Indian figures but are not associated with the naming of this particular scheme.  This question tests knowledge of Indian history and the leaders of tribal movements, a recurring theme in UPSC examinations.  Understanding the historical context of government initiatives is vital.


**8.  Which organization released the "Global Gender Gap Report 2024," which benchmarks gender parity across four key dimensions using 14 indicators, ranking Iceland, Finland, and Norway in the top three positions?**

(a)  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(b)  World Economic Forum (WEF)
(c)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(d)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.

**1.  A government initiative aims to enhance access to quality healthcare for Scheduled Tribe households, utilizing mobile medical units in remote areas.  Which program directly facilitates this objective?**

(a)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY)
(c)  National Health Mission
(d)  PM Gram Sadak Yojana

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Health Mission (NHM) explicitly focuses on improving healthcare access, particularly in underserved areas.  The description of using mobile medical units to reach areas beyond 10 km (plain areas) and 5 km (hilly areas) aligns perfectly with the NHM's mandate to extend healthcare services to remote populations.  While PM-JAY provides health insurance, it doesn't directly address the infrastructure challenge of reaching remote areas. Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan focuses on education, and PM Gram Sadak Yojana focuses on road infrastructure, neither directly relates to mobile healthcare units. The description of the program directly points to the National Health Mission.


**2.  The "Food Waste Index Report 2024" tracks food waste at specific levels of the supply chain. Which two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are directly supported by this report's findings?**

(a) SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 13 (Climate Action)
(b) SDG 12.3.1 (a) (Food Loss Index) and SDG 12.3.1 (b) (Food Waste Index)
(c) SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)
(d) SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 15 (Life on Land)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The report explicitly states it supports two indicators under SDG 12.3:  12.3.1 (a), the Food Loss Index (FLI), and 12.3.1 (b), the Food Waste Index (FWI).  These indicators directly address food loss and waste reduction, aligning with the report's focus. While food waste does contribute to climate change (SDG 13) and impacts poverty (SDG 1), the report's direct linkage is to the specific SDG 12.3 indicators.  The other options present unrelated SDGs. The direct mention of the two SDGs in the given text makes this the correct choice.


**3.  Which organization is responsible for releasing the "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024," which focuses on financing to eradicate hunger and malnutrition?**

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  The report does not specify the releasing organization.
(d)  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** While the text doesn't explicitly name the releasing organization for the 2024 report, the context strongly suggests it is the World Food Programme (WFP).  The report's focus on financing to end hunger and malnutrition is a core mandate of the WFP.  The FAO is involved in related areas but not the primary releaser of this specific report. UNEP focuses on environmental issues, and the report does not mention the organisation. Therefore, based on the subject matter, the WFP is the most logical answer.


**4.  The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. Which historical figure is the scheme named after, reflecting a spirit of resistance against colonial rule?**

(a)  Mahatma Gandhi
(b)  B.R. Ambedkar
(c)  Birsa Munda
(d)  Subhas Chandra Bose

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that PM-JUGA is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known for his resistance against British rule and his leadership in the "Ulgulan" movement.  The other options represent significant figures in Indian history but are not associated with this specific scheme. The scheme's name directly links it to Birsa Munda.


**5.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  Which section of the FRA specifically addresses these habitat rights?**

(a)  Section 2(1)(a)
(b)  Section 3(1)(e)
(c)  Section 4(1)(b)
(d)  Section 5(1)(c)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that habitat rights for PVTGs are granted under Section 3(1)(e) of the Forest Rights Act, 2006.  The other sections are not relevant to this specific right.  The precise section number is explicitly given in the provided text.


**6.  The "Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)" is a coalition focused on addressing the root causes of food crises. Which three organizations launched this network in 2016?**

(a)  World Bank, IMF, and UN-Habitat
(b)  European Union, FAO, and WFP
(c)  UNICEF, WHO, and UNDP
(d)  G20, WTO, and OECD

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly names the European Union, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Food Programme (WFP) as the founding organizations of the GNAFC in 2016.  The other options consist of organizations not directly involved in the GNAFC's founding. The text directly identifies the three founding organizations.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that the NQAS assessment was launched for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs). The other options are not explicitly mentioned in the text. The text directly identifies the two types of facilities.


**8.  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme provides financial assistance for various activities. Which committee's recommendations were used to identify the 75 PVTGs across 18 states and one Union Territory?**

(a)  The Mandal Commission
(b)  The Sarkaria Commission
(c)  The Dhebar Committee
(d)  The Sachar Committee

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text specifically mentions that the 75 PVTGs were identified based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Committee (1960-61). The other committees focused on different aspects of social justice and governance. The text provides the name of the specific committee.


**9.  The amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, were agreed upon at a recent World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting.  What is the primary aim of the IHR?**

**10.  The Supreme Court's ruling in the Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others case struck down discriminatory provisions in prison manuals. Which vulnerable group was specifically targeted by this discriminatory practice, as highlighted in the case?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes (SCs)
(b)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs)
(c)  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)
(d)  Minorities

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The text explicitly mentions that the case highlighted caste-based discrimination against Denotified Tribes (DNTs) within prisons.  While discrimination against other groups exists, this specific case focused on the DNTs. The text directly mentions the vulnerable group affected.


**1.  Which tribal group in Odisha, recognized under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), has been granted habitat rights, as per recent news?**

(a) Paudi Bhuyans of Deogarh
(b) Saora tribals of Gajapati
(c) Juangs of Keonjhar
(d) Mankidia tribe

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Juangs of Keonjhar.  The provided text explicitly states that the District Level Committee in Odisha recently approved habitat rights for the Juangs of Keonjhar and the Mankidia tribes. While options (a) and (b) are also Odisha-based tribal groups with habitat rights under FRA, the news specifically highlights the recent approval for the Juangs of Keonjhar. Option (d), Mankidia tribe, is also correct, but the question asks for *a* tribal group, making (c) the most precise and direct answer based on the given information. The question tests factual recall concerning recent developments related to habitat rights and PVTGs in Odisha.  Understanding the context of habitat rights under FRA and the significance of District Level Committee approvals is crucial for a correct response.  The other options, while representing valid groups with habitat rights, don't specifically reflect the recent news event.


**2.  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme utilizes a micro-plan approach.  What is the primary planning document used in this approach?**

(a)  State-level Development Plans
(b)  District-level Tribal Development Plans
(c)  Conservation cum Development (CCD) Plans
(d)  National Tribal Development Plans

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Conservation cum Development (CCD) Plans. The text explicitly mentions that the PVTG scheme employs a micro-plan approach through the formulation of Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent broader planning levels that may incorporate PVTG development but are not the specific micro-plan instrument highlighted in the provided text.  This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the implementation strategy of a specific government scheme targeting PVTGs. The choice of CCD plans reflects a localized, community-focused approach to development, aligning with the overall objectives of the scheme.  The distractors represent plausible but less precise alternatives, making this a difficult question requiring specific knowledge of the scheme's details.


**3.  According to the provided information, which state houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Maharashtra
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) Odisha. The text explicitly states that Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, which is the highest among all states and Union Territories.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are mentioned as having significant PVTG populations but are explicitly stated to be *not* the highest. This question directly tests factual recall of a specific statistic concerning the geographical distribution of PVTGs in India. The statistic itself is a key piece of information about the prevalence and concentration of PVTGs across different states, highlighting regional disparities in vulnerability. The distractors are plausible given the mention of these states as having significant PVTG populations but are ultimately incorrect according to the provided data.


**4.  The Supreme Court's decision in the Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others case addressed discriminatory practices against which marginalized group within the prison system?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes
(b)  Scheduled Tribes
(c)  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)
(d)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Denotified Tribes (DNTs). The text explicitly mentions that the Supreme Court's decision highlighted caste-based discrimination against prisoners belonging to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and "habitual offenders." While other marginalized groups may face discrimination, the case specifically addressed the situation of DNTs within prisons. This question tests factual recall of a significant legal case and its implications for the rights of a specific marginalized group. Understanding the historical context of DNTs and their continued vulnerability is crucial for answering this question correctly.  The distractors represent other groups that may experience discrimination, but the court case specifically focused on the DNTs' situation within the prison system.


**5.  Which of the following criteria is NOT used for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Forest-based livelihoods
(b) Pre-agricultural level of existence
(c) High literacy rates
(d) A subsistence economy

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) High literacy rates. The text explicitly lists criteria for identifying PVTGs, including forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural level of existence, a stagnant and declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy.  High literacy rates are the opposite of one of the explicit criteria, indicating a higher level of development and social progress, which contradicts the vulnerability that defines PVTGs. This question assesses understanding of the conceptual framework used to define PVTGs.  The inclusion of "High literacy rates" as a distractor highlights the importance of understanding the factors contributing to vulnerability and the characteristics that distinguish PVTGs from other tribal groups.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all explicitly mentioned as criteria for identifying PVTGs.


**6. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024, released by the World Economic Forum (WEF), uses a specific index. What is the name of this index?**

(a) Gender Inequality Index (GII)
(b) Human Development Index (HDI)
(c) Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)
(d) Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI). The text explicitly states that the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 is based on the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI).  The other options, while relevant to measuring development and gender equality, are not the specific index used in this report. This question directly tests factual recall of the terminology used in a specific report on gender equality.  Understanding the different indices used to measure gender equality and development is crucial for interpreting such reports and their findings.  The distractors are plausible because they are all indices related to development and social progress, but only GGGI is directly relevant to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024.


**7.  The Rome Declaration on Nutrition focuses on eradicating a specific issue. What is the primary focus of this declaration?**

(a)  Reducing child mortality rates
(b)  Improving sanitation infrastructure
(c)  Eradicating hunger and preventing all forms of malnutrition
(d)  Promoting sustainable agriculture practices

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Eradicating hunger and preventing all forms of malnutrition.  The text explicitly states that the Rome Declaration on Nutrition commits countries to eradicating hunger and preventing all forms of malnutrition worldwide.  While the other options are related to broader development goals, they are not the specific and primary focus of the Rome Declaration.  This question tests factual recall about a specific international agreement related to nutrition.  Understanding the key objectives of the Rome Declaration and its relevance to global efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition is crucial for answering correctly.  The distractors are plausible because they are all important aspects of development and public health, but only option (c) accurately reflects the declaration's primary focus.


**8.  The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024, aims to achieve progress in which Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?**

(a)  SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality)
(b)  SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger)
(c)  SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action)
(d)  SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). The text explicitly states that the Global Alliance aims to support and accelerate efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty (Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2), while reducing inequalities (SDG 10).  The other options represent important SDGs but are not the primary focus of this specific alliance.  This question tests the ability to link a specific international initiative to its stated objectives within the broader framework of the Sustainable Development Goals.  Understanding the interconnectedness of different SDGs and the specific targets of various global initiatives is essential for a correct response.  The distractors are plausible because they represent other important development goals but do not align with the stated aims of the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty.


**9. Which of the following organizations is NOT involved in the production of the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)?**

(a)  The European Union
(b)  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  The World Food Programme (WFP)
(d)  The World Health Organization (WHO)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) The World Health Organization (WHO). The text explicitly states that the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), which produces the GRFC, was launched by the European Union, the FAO, and the WFP.  The WHO, while involved in various aspects of global health and nutrition, is not explicitly mentioned as a partner in the GNAFC or the production of the GRFC.  This question tests factual recall about the partnership structure of an international initiative focused on food security.  Understanding the roles and responsibilities of different international organizations in addressing global challenges is essential for answering correctly.  The distractors are plausible because they are all involved in international development and humanitarian efforts, but only the WHO is not explicitly listed as a partner in the GNAFC.


**10.  The Village Resource Fund (VRF) addresses vulnerabilities faced by which unit of society?**

(a)  Individual families
(b)  Villages as a whole
(c)  Households or communities
(d)  Districts

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Households or communities. The text explicitly states that the VRF is a corpus fund given to address vulnerabilities like food insecurity, health risks, hospitalization, natural calamity, etc., faced by the household(s) or community.  While the fund may indirectly benefit villages as a whole, the direct beneficiaries are households or communities within a village. This question tests the understanding of the scope and target beneficiaries of a specific development fund.  Understanding the different levels of intervention in development programs and the specific target groups is crucial for a correct response.  The distractors are plausible because they represent broader geographical units, but the VRF specifically targets households or communities as the primary beneficiaries.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are directly mentioned as goals of the Abhiyan. Goal 1 addresses infrastructure and healthcare access, while Goal 3 focuses on improving education access and GER.  The absence of a specific commitment to a nationwide network of vocational training centers in the stated goals distinguishes option (b) as the incorrect one. The focus on convergence and leveraging existing schemes is a key feature of PM-JUGA, which means the skill development component is integrated into the broader framework of other initiatives rather than being a standalone, fully independent program.

**3. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is a significant international agreement. Which of the following statements accurately reflects one of its key aims?**

(a) To establish quotas for persons with disabilities in all sectors of employment.
(b) To provide financial assistance to all individuals with disabilities regardless of their nationality.
(c) To promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.
(d) To mandate the creation of specialized educational institutions exclusively for persons with disabilities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The primary objective of the UN-CRPD, as stated in the text, is to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. This encompasses a broad range of rights, including social inclusion, accessibility, and non-discrimination. Options (a), (b), and (d) represent actions that may support the convention's aims but are not its core objective.  The convention's focus is on ensuring equal rights and opportunities for persons with disabilities within existing societal structures, rather than creating separate systems or imposing specific quotas. The focus on inherent dignity and full participation is central to the UN-CRPD's philosophy.  This inclusive approach aims to integrate persons with disabilities fully into society rather than treating them as a separate group requiring specialized provisions.

**4.  The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" Scheme is a centrally sponsored initiative.  What is the primary funding mechanism for this scheme?**

(a)  A combination of central and state government funding, with a 50/50 split.
(b)  International grants and loans secured by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.
(c)  100% Central assistance in the form of Grant-in-Aid and Creation of Capital Assets.
(d)  Private sector donations and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PVTG scheme is explicitly stated as having 100% Central assistance. This funding is provided in the form of Grant-in-Aid and Creation of Capital Assets. This means the central government bears the entire financial burden of the program. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the funding source.  The 100% central funding highlights the government's commitment to the welfare of PVTGs. This centralized funding model ensures consistent and reliable financial support, reducing dependence on fluctuating state budgets or external funding sources. The provision of both Grant-in-Aid and support for capital asset creation demonstrates a comprehensive approach to development, addressing both immediate needs and long-term capacity building.

**5.  The Aadharshila curriculum focuses on early childhood care and education.  What age group does this curriculum specifically target?**

(a)  Children aged 0-3 years.
(b)  Children aged 3-6 years.
(c)  Children aged 6-9 years.
(d)  Children aged 9-12 years.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Aadharshila curriculum is explicitly designed for children aged 3-6 years.  This aligns with the crucial early years of development, where foundational learning and social-emotional development are paramount. Options (a), (c), and (d) represent different age groups outside the scope of the Aadharshila curriculum. The 3-6 year age bracket is critical for establishing a strong foundation for future learning.  The curriculum's focus on this age group reflects a recognition of the importance of early childhood development in shaping a child's overall cognitive, social, and emotional well-being.  The curriculum's design and content are tailored to the developmental needs and learning styles of children within this specific age range.

**6.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is used to rank educational institutions. Which of the following IS NOT a parameter used by NIRF in its ranking methodology?**

(a) Teaching, Learning, and Resources
(b) Research and Professional Practices
(c)  Student Satisfaction Surveys
(d) Perception

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** While student feedback is undoubtedly valuable, the NIRF ranking methodology explicitly lists Teaching, Learning, and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception as its parameters.  Student Satisfaction Surveys, while potentially informative, are not explicitly mentioned as a core component of the NIRF ranking process.  The other options are all explicitly mentioned as key parameters in the NIRF framework. The exclusion of student satisfaction surveys from the core parameters emphasizes the framework's reliance on objective measures and data-driven assessments. This approach aims to minimize subjectivity and ensure that the rankings reflect the overall quality and performance of institutions based on established criteria.

**7.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) has launched several key initiatives. Which of the following is NOT one of the initiatives announced?**

(a) Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(b) Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(c) National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) partnerships
(d) ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The ANRF has launched PAIR, MAHA, and ACE initiatives.  The NSDC, while relevant to skill development, is not explicitly mentioned as an ANRF initiative.  The focus of the ANRF is on fostering research and innovation in higher education and advanced research sectors.  The three initiatives mentioned directly support this goal.  The absence of explicit mention of NSDC partnerships in the description of ANRF initiatives indicates that it is not a direct component of the ANRF's current strategic plans.  This differentiation is crucial for understanding the ANRF's specific focus on research and innovation rather than broader skill development programs.

**8.  The draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024 outlines several key pillars. Which of the following is NOT a pillar of the draft NSP 2024?**

(a) Excellence on the Global Stage
(b) Sports for Economic Development
(c)  Promotion of Traditional Martial Arts Exclusively
(d) Sports for Social Development


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The draft NSP 2024 emphasizes Excellence on the Global Stage, Sports for Economic Development, and Sports for Social Development as its pillars. While promoting indigenous games is part of the social development pillar, the policy doesn't focus exclusively on traditional martial arts. The other options are explicitly mentioned as key pillars.  The omission of a pillar focused solely on traditional martial arts indicates a broader approach to sports development, encompassing a wider range of disciplines and activities. This broader approach reflects a recognition of the diverse nature of sports and their potential contributions to national development. The policy's focus on holistic development implies that various sports and activities are valued and promoted, rather than emphasizing specific disciplines to the exclusion of others.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the material.


**1.  A crucial international convention focusing on the rights and inclusion of individuals with physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, adopted in 2006 and effective from 2008, is associated with which of the following entities?**

(a) The World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) The United Nations (UN)
(c) The International Labour Organization (ILO)
(d) The Asian Development Bank (ADB)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD).  The UN is the body responsible for creating and promoting international human rights conventions. The WHO focuses on health, the ILO on labor standards, and the ADB on development finance in Asia and the Pacific; none of these have the primary mandate of the UN-CRPD. The UN-CRPD aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.  Its adoption and implementation signify a global commitment to disability inclusion. The convention's wide-ranging provisions address issues such as accessibility, non-discrimination, and participation in society, highlighting the UN's significant role in advocating for the rights of persons with disabilities on a global scale.  The other organizations, while important, do not have this specific mandate.


**2.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), a flagship initiative aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India, is named after which prominent figure known for their resistance against British rule?**

(a) Rani Lakshmibai
(b) Mangal Pandey
(c) Birsa Munda
(d) Tantia Tope

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** PM-JUGA is explicitly named after Birsa Munda, who is remembered for his leadership in the Ulgulan movement against British colonial rule.  The scheme's focus on holistic development of tribal communities aligns with Birsa Munda's legacy of fighting for tribal rights and welfare.  While the other figures mentioned (Rani Lakshmibai, Mangal Pandey, and Tantia Tope) were also significant figures in India's struggle for independence, they are not directly associated with the PM-JUGA initiative.  The name itself clearly indicates the scheme's intention to honor Birsa Munda’s contribution and to work towards the upliftment of tribal communities, reflecting a commitment to social justice and historical reconciliation.


**3. Which of the following is NOT a key initiative announced under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) to foster research and innovation in India?**

(a) Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(b) Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(c) ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)
(d) National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NIRF is a separate initiative under the Ministry of Education, aimed at ranking educational institutions.  PAIR, MAHA, and ACE are all core components of the ANRF's strategy to boost research and innovation by fostering collaborations, supporting targeted research in priority areas, and establishing world-class research centers. The ANRF, established under the ANRF Act 2023, aims to create a knowledge-driven society in India, whereas the NIRF functions as an independent ranking system to evaluate and categorize educational institutions. The ANRF’s initiatives focus on funding, mentoring, and creating centers of excellence, while the NIRF is a ranking mechanism.


**4. The Global Hunger Index (GHI), a collaborative effort by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, primarily assesses which of the following aspects related to global food security?**

(a) Food production and distribution efficiency
(b) Agricultural technology adoption rates
(c) Prevalence of undernourishment and child malnutrition
(d) International food trade policies

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The GHI specifically focuses on measuring the prevalence of undernourishment, child wasting, and child stunting. These indicators directly reflect the severity of hunger and malnutrition within a population.  While food production, technology adoption, and trade policies are all relevant factors influencing food security, the GHI's core methodology centers on direct measures of hunger and its impact on children's health. The GHI score provides a comprehensive assessment of a nation's hunger levels, and it directly reflects the nutritional status of the population.  The index uses multiple indicators to calculate a score that reflects the severity of hunger in a country.


**5.  The Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is directly linked to which of the following initiatives aimed at empowering women in rural India?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
(b)  Lakhpati Didi Initiative
(c)  National Food Security Act
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Lakhpati Didi initiative is a direct outcome of the DAY-NRLM. This mission focuses on empowering women through the formation of Self Help Groups (SHGs), and the Lakhpati Didi initiative specifically aims to increase the income of women SHG members to at least ₹1 lakh annually.  While the other options mentioned are important government schemes, they are not directly linked to the empowerment of women through SHGs in the same way as the Lakhpati Didi initiative. The DAY-NRLM aims at poverty reduction and women empowerment through SHGs, and the Lakhpati Didi initiative is a direct outcome of this mission's success in improving the livelihoods of rural women.  The other options are broader socio-economic programs, while the Lakhpati Didi initiative is a specific program aimed at empowering women economically.


**6.  Which of the following acts provides the legal basis for granting habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India?**

(a) The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996
(b) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(c) The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006
(d) The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes Act, 1996

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), explicitly grants habitat rights to PVTGs.  This act recognizes the rights of forest-dwelling tribal communities over the forest land they have traditionally occupied and used. The other acts address different aspects related to the welfare and protection of scheduled tribes but do not directly provide for habitat rights.  The FRA is a landmark legislation that recognizes the historical connection of tribal communities with forests and aims to secure their land rights and livelihoods.  It is a crucial instrument for the protection of vulnerable tribal groups, including PVTGs.  The other options focus on broader aspects of tribal welfare, but the FRA specifically addresses habitat rights.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on science and technology,  with detailed explanations:


**1.  A government initiative aims to bridge the research gap between nascent and established institutions by pairing them for mentorship.  This program operates on a hub-and-spoke model and focuses on accelerating innovation. Which initiative best fits this description?**

(a)  Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(b)  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)
(c)  Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(d)  Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description perfectly matches the Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) initiative.  PAIR explicitly aims to connect universities with less developed research capabilities ("nascent stage") with top-tier institutions to provide mentorship. The hub-and-spoke model is a key feature of PAIR, with established institutions serving as hubs and less developed ones as spokes. Options (a) and (b) are also ANRF initiatives, but they have different primary focuses. MAHA concentrates on solution-focused research in specific areas, while ACE establishes world-class research centers. DAPST, option (d), is a completely unrelated scheme focusing on tribal development, not research partnerships.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of specific government programs related to scientific advancement.

(d)  Department of Science and Technology (DST)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the erstwhile Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) was subsumed into the ANRF.  The other options are incorrect. The NETF (National Educational Technology Forum) and ABC (Academic Bank of Credit) are related to education and credit systems but not directly involved in the ANRF's formation. The DST (Department of Science and Technology) is the administrative department for ANRF, but it was not subsumed into it. This question tests factual recall of the organizational history of ANRF and its relationship to other scientific bodies in India.


**3.  A global index assesses hunger levels across countries, classifying them into severity categories. This index highlights the connection between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.  Which index is being described?**

(a)  Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)
(b)  Human Development Index (HDI)
(c)  Global Hunger Index (GHI)
(d)  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Index

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description clearly points to the Global Hunger Index (GHI). The GHI is an annual report that ranks countries based on their hunger levels, classifying them into categories like "serious," "alarming," etc.  The index explicitly acknowledges the links between hunger and factors such as gender inequality and climate change.  The other options are incorrect.  The MPI (Multidimensional Poverty Index) measures poverty across various dimensions, the HDI (Human Development Index) measures human development, and the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) are a broader set of global development targets.  This question tests conceptual understanding of global development indices and their specific focuses.


**4. Which of the following is NOT a key amendment to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, as discussed in the provided text?**

(a) Defining a pandemic emergency based on geographical spread and national health system capacity.
(b) Establishing a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation.
(c)  Creating a global fund to support all aspects of healthcare development.
(d) Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism for developing countries.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the amendments to the IHR focus on improved international cooperation and financial mechanisms to support developing countries, they do not create a global fund for all aspects of healthcare development.  Option (a) and (d) are correctly mentioned as key amendments. Option (b) describes the establishment of a States Parties Committee, crucial for IHR implementation. Option (c) is incorrect because the text describes the establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism specifically targeting the needs of developing countries, not a general global healthcare fund. This question assesses the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding concepts within the context of international health regulations and tests factual recall and analysis.


**5. The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve socio-economic conditions for a specific demographic.  Which group is the primary beneficiary of this scheme?**

(a)  Urban slum dwellers
(b)  Rural farmers
(c)  Tribal communities
(d)  Marginalized urban youth

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The name itself indicates the target group: "Janjatiya" refers to tribal communities. PM-JUGA explicitly focuses on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India. The other options are incorrect. While other groups may indirectly benefit from some aspects of the scheme, the primary beneficiaries are tribal populations. This question tests factual recall and understanding of government schemes targeting specific social groups.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on science and technology, with detailed explanations:


**1.  A global initiative tracks food waste at the retail and consumer levels, contributing to the achievement of a specific Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) by 2030.  Which organization is the custodian of this initiative, and which SDG indicator does it support?**

Options (a), (b), and (d) represent narrower and less comprehensive definitions. This question tests conceptual understanding of financing for food security.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a detailed understanding of the subject matter.


**1.  Which entity, established through a specific Act of Parliament, serves as the highest statutory body for disaster management in India and is headed by the Prime Minister?**

(a)  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
(b)  National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC)
(c)  National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)
(d)  Election Commission of India


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The NDMA is explicitly mentioned in the target content as the "apex statutory body for Disaster Management in India, established through the Disaster Management Act, 2005," and is headed by the Prime Minister of India.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. The NHRC is a constitutional body focusing on human rights, the NCSC deals with the welfare of Scheduled Castes, and the Election Commission of India manages elections.  These bodies have distinct mandates unrelated to disaster management.  Understanding the statutory basis and the hierarchical structure of government organizations is crucial for UPSC aspirants. The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of India's governance structure.

Option (b) accurately identifies the initiative and its key partners: the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Invest India. The other options present plausible but incorrect initiatives and partnerships, testing the candidate's knowledge of global development initiatives and their key players.  The inclusion of specific details like the launch location (Davos 2024) and the involvement of Invest India elevates the difficulty level, requiring precise factual recall.


**2.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005,  was enacted under a specific constitutional provision empowering the legislature to create special provisions for a certain vulnerable group.  This Act defines various forms of abuse and provides for redressal mechanisms through designated committees.  Which constitutional article provides the legal basis for this Act, and what specific type of abuse is *not* explicitly covered under the civil remedies provided by this act?**

(a) Article 14(2), which prohibits discrimination based on religion, and does not explicitly cover emotional abuse.
(b) Article 15(3), which allows special provisions for women and children, and does not explicitly cover marital rape.
(c) Article 21, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, and does not explicitly cover economic abuse.
(d) Article 39(e), which directs state policy to ensure equal pay for equal work, and does not explicitly cover physical abuse.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the legal foundation of the PWDVA, 2005, and a key limitation within its civil remedies. Option (b) correctly identifies Article 15(3) as the constitutional basis for enacting special provisions for women and children. Crucially, it highlights that while the Act addresses various forms of domestic violence, it does *not* provide for criminal proceedings related to marital rape, only civil remedies.

**Explanation:** The question tests knowledge of the UN-CRPD. Options (a), (c), and (d) are key provisions of the convention. Option (b) is incorrect; while the convention promotes inclusion and equal opportunities, it does not mandate specific quotas for government jobs universally across all signatory nations. The focus is on enabling participation and inclusion rather than imposing rigid quotas.  The question necessitates a deep understanding of the treaty's principles and avoids superficial interpretations.


**8.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, and its subsequent amendments, regulate abortion in India.  The Act outlines conditions under which abortion is permissible and specifies the gestational limits for termination based on different factors.  According to the amended Act, under what circumstances is abortion permissible beyond 24 weeks of gestation?**

(a)  UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
(b) Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP)
(c)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(d) World Food Programme (WFP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  The passage explicitly states that the FAO is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), a key indicator under SDG 12.3.  UNEP and WRAP are involved in the Food Waste Index Report but are not custodians of the FLI.  The WFP is focused on food aid and distribution. This question assesses factual recall regarding the roles of different international organizations in monitoring and addressing food security and sustainability goals.

(b)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(c) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(d) World Food Programme (WFP)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) World Health Organization (WHO). While the WHO plays a crucial role in global health and is often involved in addressing food insecurity's health impacts, the passage explicitly names the European Union, FAO, and WFP as the founding partners of the GNAFC.  This question tests factual recall about the GNAFC's founding members and highlights the subtle differences in the mandates of various UN agencies.

(a) Forest-based livelihoods
(b)  Pre-agricultural level of existence
(c)  High literacy rates
(d)  A subsistence economy

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The passage lists forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural existence, stagnant/declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy as criteria for identifying PVTGs.  High literacy rates would contradict the vulnerability characteristic of PVTGs. This question tests comprehension of the criteria used to define PVTGs and highlights the socio-economic characteristics associated with vulnerability.


**7.  The Global Gender Gap Report 2024, published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), uses the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) to measure gender parity across four key dimensions.  Which of the following is NOT one of those four dimensions?**

(a) Health and Survival
(b)  Educational Attainment
(c)  Economic Participation and Opportunity
(d)  Environmental Sustainability

The other options list unrelated articles of the Constitution. This question tests factual recall about the legal basis of the Supreme Court's ruling and its implications for constitutional rights.


Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, designed to be challenging and relevant to UPSC-style examinations.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.

**1.  A crucial set of amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, was recently agreed upon.  Which of the following is NOT a key amendment adopted at the 77th World Health Assembly (WHA)?**

(a) Establishing a coordinating financial mechanism to support developing countries.
(b) Creating national IHR authorities to enhance inter-country coordination.
(c) Defining a pandemic emergency solely based on the mortality rate exceeding national healthcare capacity.
(d) Establishing a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The amendments focused on improving global pandemic preparedness and response. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect key changes made to the IHR.  Option (c) is incorrect because the definition of a pandemic emergency includes "wide geographical spread" or high risk thereof, and exceeding or potentially exceeding national health system response capacity, not solely based on mortality rates.  A pandemic's impact is multifaceted, encompassing morbidity, healthcare system strain, and societal disruption, not just mortality figures.  The IHR amendments aim for a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to pandemic declaration and management.  A focus solely on mortality might overlook other critical factors determining the severity and global spread of a disease outbreak.


**2. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 revealed concerning trends in global hunger. Which of the following statements about the GHI 2024 findings is FALSE?**

(a)  The GHI score for India improved compared to the previous year.
(b)  The global GHI score indicates moderate levels of hunger severity.
(c)  The report highlights a strong correlation between climate change and improved nutrition outcomes globally.
(d)  Child wasting and stunting remain significantly high in India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The GHI 2024 report clearly demonstrates a link between climate change, gender inequality, and hunger.  However, the link is not one of improvement in nutrition outcomes.  Instead, climate change exacerbates food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly impacting women and girls. Extreme weather events and climate emergencies disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, leading to reduced food availability, disrupted livelihoods, and increased malnutrition.  Options (a) and (d) reflect accurate findings of the report concerning India's GHI score and high rates of child wasting and stunting. Option (b) correctly states the global GHI score indicates moderate hunger severity.  The report's emphasis on the negative impact of climate change on hunger is a crucial aspect of understanding the complex interplay of factors contributing to global food insecurity.


**3.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) aims to foster research and innovation in India. Which of the following is NOT a key initiative announced under the ANRF?**

(a)  Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(b)  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)
(c)  National Science Talent Search Examination (NSTSE)
(d)  Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The ANRF focuses on supporting research and innovation through various initiatives.  MAHA, ACE, and PAIR are all key programs under the ANRF.  The National Science Talent Search Examination (NSTSE) is not associated with the ANRF.  While promoting scientific talent is important, the NSTSE is a separate initiative managed by a different organization.  The ANRF's initiatives are focused on creating research hubs, fostering partnerships between institutions, and establishing centers of excellence to address specific national priorities.  The ANRF aims to cultivate a robust and sustainable research ecosystem in India, aligning with the objectives of the National Education Policy.


**4.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is a significant international instrument. Which of the following statements regarding the UN-CRPD is INCORRECT?**

(a)  It entered into force in 2008.
(b)  India is a signatory to the convention.
(c)  Its objective is solely focused on providing financial assistance to persons with disabilities.
(d)  It aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN-CRPD is a comprehensive human rights treaty that aims to protect and promote the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities.  Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect the convention's key aspects, including its entry into force, India's status as a signatory, and its broader objective of ensuring full and equal enjoyment of human rights.  Option (c) is incorrect. While the UN-CRPD promotes the inclusion and well-being of persons with disabilities, its scope is much broader than providing only financial assistance. It encompasses a wide range of rights, including accessibility, education, employment, healthcare, and participation in society.  The convention emphasizes a human rights-based approach, focusing on empowerment and inclusion rather than solely on financial aid.


**5. The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. Which of the following is NOT a key feature or objective of PM-JUGA?**

(a)  It seeks to address critical gaps in social infrastructure in tribal areas.
(b)  It is named after Birsa Munda.
(c)  It primarily focuses on providing direct cash transfers to tribal households.
(d)  It utilizes a convergence approach, leveraging various existing schemes.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  PM-JUGA aims for comprehensive improvement in the lives of tribal communities by focusing on infrastructure development, healthcare, education, and livelihood opportunities.  It leverages the strengths of existing schemes through a convergence approach, making it a holistic initiative.  The scheme is named after Birsa Munda, recognizing his contributions to tribal rights.  Option (c) is incorrect; PM-JUGA does not primarily focus on direct cash transfers. Instead, it uses a multi-pronged strategy involving infrastructure improvements, skill development, and access to essential services.  The initiative emphasizes sustainable and long-term development rather than short-term financial aid.  The program's focus is on building capacity and providing access to opportunities within the community, contributing to lasting socio-economic change.


**6.  The National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates for India provide insights into the country's healthcare expenditure. According to the NHA, which of the following trends is INCORRECT?**

(a)  Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP has increased.
(b)  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of THE has increased.
(c)  Current Health Expenditure (CHE) as a percentage of THE has increased.
(d)  Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) on healthcare as a percentage of THE has decreased.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NHA data show a positive trend in the overall health expenditure as a percentage of GDP and an increase in the government's share of health expenditure.  Also, there's a decrease in out-of-pocket expenditure as a percentage of THE.  Option (c) is incorrect because the NHA data indicates that current health expenditure (CHE) as a percentage of THE has *decreased*, not increased.  This reflects a shift in the composition of healthcare spending, with a smaller proportion allocated to operational expenses compared to capital expenditures. This could potentially indicate investment in infrastructure and long-term healthcare improvements.  Understanding these trends is crucial for policy-makers to design effective and sustainable healthcare strategies.


**7. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranks educational institutions in India. Which of the following statements about NIRF is FALSE?**

(a)  The NIRF ranking includes an assessment of "Innovation".
(b)  IIT Madras has consistently topped the overall category in recent years.
(c)  The NIRF ranking only considers central government-funded institutions.
(d)  The NIRF uses five parameters for ranking institutions.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NIRF framework comprehensively assesses various Indian educational institutions based on multiple parameters, including teaching, learning, research, and outreach.  IIT Madras has indeed consistently achieved top rankings.  The inclusion of "Innovation" as a ranking parameter demonstrates the framework's adaptability to evolving educational priorities.  Option (c) is incorrect. The NIRF ranking is not limited to central government-funded institutions.  It encompasses a wide range of institutions, both public and private, across various categories.  This broad scope allows for a comprehensive comparison of educational quality and performance across diverse institutional contexts, promoting healthy competition and improvement in the higher education sector.


**8.  The establishment of foreign university campuses in India has been facilitated by recent regulations. Which of the following is NOT a criterion for setting up a foreign university campus in India under the UGC regulations of 2023?**

(a)  Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) must be ranked among the top 500 globally.
(b)  The campus must be established within one year of the Letter of Intent (LoI) issuance.
(c)  Multiple FHEIs can collaborate to establish a campus in India.
(d)  The UGC grants an in-principle approval and issues a LoI.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UGC regulations of 2023 aim to attract high-quality foreign universities to establish campuses in India.  The regulations specify ranking criteria, allow for collaborative ventures, and involve a phased approval process.  Option (b) is incorrect; the regulations allow for a two-year timeframe for establishing campuses from the date of LoI issuance, not one year.  The two-year period acknowledges the complexities involved in establishing a new campus, including infrastructure development, faculty recruitment, and curriculum development.  This realistic timeframe ensures that the initiative is implemented effectively and sustainably.  This initiative aligns with the National Education Policy 2020's vision of providing international exposure to Indian students.




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on science and technology,  with detailed explanations:


**1.  A significant initiative aims to comprehensively improve the socio-economic conditions of specific tribal groups while preserving their cultural heritage.  This initiative is funded entirely by the central government and utilizes a micro-plan approach involving the creation of Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans. Which scheme is being described?**

(a) PM Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan
(b) Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme
(c) Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana
(d) National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description accurately reflects the "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme."  This centrally sponsored scheme prioritizes the holistic socio-economic upliftment of PVTGs while safeguarding their cultural identity.  The 100% central funding and the emphasis on CCD plans for a micro-plan approach are key features.  Option (a), PM Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan, focuses on tribal villages but doesn't specifically target PVTGs with the same level of cultural preservation emphasis. Options (c) and (d) relate to food security, not the socio-economic development of specific vulnerable tribal groups.  The question's detailed description serves as a strong discriminator, making it a difficult question for candidates lacking precise knowledge of the PVTG scheme's specifics.


**2.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA) defines a specific area encompassing customary and other habitats within reserved and protected forests.  This definition is crucial for the legal recognition of rights for certain forest-dwelling communities. What is this defined area called within the FRA framework?**

(a) Community Forest Resource Area
(b) Reserved Forest Block
(c) Habitat
(d) Traditional Forest Area

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FRA explicitly defines "habitat" as the area encompassing customary and other habitats of primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes. This precise definition is central to understanding the scope of habitat rights under the FRA. The other options are either less specific or do not directly correspond to the FRA's definition of the area where these rights apply.  The question tests factual recall of the specific terminology used in the FRA, making it a moderately difficult question.


**3.  A global report highlights the alarming levels of hunger in numerous countries, jeopardizing the goal of "Zero Hunger" by 2030.  This report also emphasizes the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and hunger, with women and girls disproportionately affected. Which report is being described?**

(a)  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report
(b)  Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)
(c)  Food Waste Index Report
(d) Global Hunger Index (GHI)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) report regularly assesses global hunger levels, including the impact of climate change and gender inequality. The description aligns directly with the key findings of the GHI, which highlights the alarming hunger levels in many countries and the disproportionate impact on women and girls.  Options (a), (b), and (c) address related food security aspects, but not the specific focus on hunger levels and the interlinkages with gender and climate change that is central to the GHI. The question's emphasis on interconnected factors makes it a difficult question, requiring a nuanced understanding of various food security reports.


**4.  A specific scheme in India provides financial support to states and union territories for various activities, including education, housing, agricultural development, and infrastructure improvements, targeting a particular vulnerable population group.  This scheme is entirely funded by the central government. Which population group is the primary beneficiary of this scheme?**

(a)  All Scheduled Tribes
(b)  Forest Rights Act (FRA) beneficiaries
(c) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(d)  All rural households

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme" provides financial assistance to states and UTs to improve the living conditions of PVTGs.  The description matches the scheme's features, emphasizing 100% central funding and the range of developmental activities it supports. The other options are too broad; the scheme is specifically designed for PVTGs, not all Scheduled Tribes, FRA beneficiaries, or rural households. The question tests the understanding of the target beneficiaries of a specific government scheme, making it a moderately difficult question.


**5.  An international organization, established in 2016, brings together governments, international organizations, and NGOs to improve humanitarian responses and reduce the number of people facing acute food insecurity.  This organization works to address the root causes of food crises.  Which organization is this?**

(a) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(b) World Food Programme (WFP)
(c) Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
(d)  UN Environment Programme (UNEP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) precisely fits the description. It's a collaborative effort involving multiple stakeholders to tackle food crises comprehensively.  While FAO and WFP are involved in food security, they are not the coordinating organizations described. UNEP focuses on environmental issues, not directly on food crises in the same collaborative way. The question requires knowledge of international organizations and their roles, making it a difficult question.

Note that the difficulty arises from requiring precise recall of details and nuanced understanding of the schemes and initiatives mentioned.  The explanations are detailed to justify the correct answer and address potential misconceptions.

**1.  A government initiative aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India, drawing inspiration from a historical tribal leader's resistance movement.  This initiative, spanning five years, covers approximately 63,000 villages and involves 25 interventions implemented by 17 ministries.  Which of the following correctly identifies this initiative and its primary funding source?**

(a)  Samarth Scheme, funded by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), funded by existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.
(c)  PM-KISAN scheme, funded through direct transfers to farmers' bank accounts.
(d)  Ni-Kshay Poshan Yojana (NPY), funded under the National Health Mission.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description clearly points to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA). The question highlights key features: focus on tribal communities, inspiration from a resistance movement (Birsa Munda's Ulgulan), five-year duration, extensive coverage of villages, and multi-ministry involvement.  The funding source is explicitly mentioned as existing DAPST grants. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they refer to different schemes with different objectives and funding mechanisms. Samarth focuses on the textile sector, PM-KISAN on farmer income support, and NPY on tuberculosis patient nutrition.

(b)  Rashtriya Garima Abhiyaan, Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013.
(c)  PM-JUGA, Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006.
(d)  Accessible India Campaign, Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description accurately describes Rashtriya Garima Abhiyaan, a campaign explicitly focused on eliminating manual scavenging and rehabilitating manual scavengers.  The question correctly links it to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. Option (a) is incorrect because the Swachh Bharat Mission, while related to sanitation, doesn't specifically target manual scavenging rehabilitation. Option (c) is incorrect as PM-JUGA focuses on tribal development. Option (d) is about disability rights, not manual scavenging.


**3. Which initiative, launched in 2023, aims to create a substantial number of women entrepreneurs with annual household incomes exceeding a specific threshold, leveraging self-help groups (SHGs) and various financial assistance mechanisms?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(b)  Lakhpati Didi Initiative
(c)  Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM)
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The question directly points to the Lakhpati Didi Initiative.  It highlights the key features:  the goal of creating a large number of women entrepreneurs earning over ₹1 lakh annually, using SHGs as the primary vehicle, and providing financial support through revolving funds, bank loans, and other schemes.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are related to different programs: maternal welfare, rural livelihoods, and food security respectively, none of which specifically target the creation of a large number of women entrepreneurs earning a specific income threshold.


**4.  An international convention, adopted in 2006 and in force since 2008, aims to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for individuals with specific impairments.  This convention has 164 signatories, including India. Which convention is this?**

(a)  The Incheon Strategy
(b)  The Biwako Millennium Framework
(c)  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)
(d)  Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description perfectly matches the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD). The key elements—adoption year, entry into force, objective of ensuring equal rights, and the number of signatories—all align with the UN-CRPD. Options (a), (b), and (d) are related initiatives but are not the primary international convention described in the question.


**5.  A formal mechanism evaluates a person's existing knowledge, skills, and experience gained through various learning pathways, integrating them into the formal education system.  This mechanism is used in higher education to grant credit for prior learning.  What is this mechanism called?**

(a)  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)
(b)  National Research Foundation (NRF)
(c)  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)
(d)  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description accurately defines Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).  It explicitly mentions the evaluation of prior knowledge and skills from diverse sources, their integration into the formal education system, and the awarding of credit.

ABC is a credit storage system, NRF is a research body, and NETF is a technology forum.


**1.  Which initiative aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India, drawing inspiration from Birsa Munda's legacy and leveraging existing development grants?**

(a)  Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM)
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(c)  National Health Accounts Estimates
(d)  Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), also known as Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan, is explicitly designed to uplift tribal communities socio-economically.  Its name honors Birsa Munda, a significant tribal leader.  Crucially, the scheme doesn't create new funding but strategically utilizes pre-existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, demonstrating efficient resource allocation.  Options (a), (c), and (d) address different aspects of development: rural livelihoods, healthcare finance, and accessibility for the disabled, respectively, none of which directly focus on the comprehensive socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities in the manner of PM-JUGA.  The interdisciplinary nature of PM-JUGA, encompassing multiple ministries and development goals, makes it a unique and significant initiative for tribal empowerment.  The utilization of existing funds highlights a pragmatic approach to development, aligning with sustainable development goals.


**2.  A scheme aimed at empowering women through self-help groups (SHGs), resulting in the recognition of "Lakhpati Didis," is associated with which of the following?**

(a)  The Forest Rights Act (FRA)
(b)  The National Medical Register (NMR) Portal
(c)  Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM)
(d)  The Accessible India Campaign

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Lakhpati Didi" initiative, recognizing women who achieve significant annual household income through SHGs, is directly linked to the Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM).  DAY-NRLM provides the foundational framework for SHG development and empowerment. The revolving fund mechanism and other financial assistance programs under DAY-NRLM are instrumental in enabling women to achieve economic independence, aligning directly with the "Lakhpati Didi" recognition.  The other options are unrelated: the FRA concerns forest rights for tribal communities, the NMR portal is a medical practitioner database, and the Accessible India Campaign focuses on disability inclusion.  The success of the "Lakhpati Didi" initiative showcases the effectiveness of community-based approaches to women's empowerment and economic development, a key aspect of DAY-NRLM's broader goals. This demonstrates the potential of SHGs as tools for poverty alleviation and women's economic participation, a significant policy achievement.


**3. Which international convention, adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities?**

(a)  The Biwako Millennium Framework
(b)  The Incheon Strategy
(c)  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)
(d)  The Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is the primary international legal instrument specifically designed to protect and promote the rights of persons with disabilities.  Its adoption in 2006 and entry into force in 2008 mark a significant milestone in international human rights law.  While the Biwako Millennium Framework, the Incheon Strategy, and the Asia-Pacific Declaration all address disability inclusion, the UN-CRPD holds a unique legal status as a binding international treaty, obligating signatory states to implement its provisions into national law.  This legal framework provides a stronger foundation for advocating for and protecting the rights of persons with disabilities globally.  India's status as a signatory underscores its commitment to international human rights standards and the inclusion of persons with disabilities in society.  The convention’s comprehensive approach, encompassing various aspects of disability rights, makes it a crucial instrument in achieving a more inclusive and equitable world.


**4.  The National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates, released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, utilize which framework for data collection and analysis?**

(a)  The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) methodology
(b)  The System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011
(c)  The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) data
(d)  The Accessible India Campaign's data collection methods

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NHA estimates explicitly state their reliance on the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 framework.  SHA 2011 provides a globally recognized standard for classifying and analyzing health expenditures, enabling international comparisons.  The other options are incorrect: NFHS focuses on health indicators, PMJAY is a specific health insurance scheme, and the Accessible India Campaign addresses disability inclusion.  The use of SHA 2011 ensures consistency and comparability of NHA data with other countries, allowing for better understanding of India's health financing landscape within a global context.  This methodological rigor enhances the credibility and usefulness of the NHA estimates for policymaking and resource allocation in the healthcare sector.  The adoption of international standards demonstrates a commitment to transparency and evidence-based policymaking in the health domain.


**5. The  "YuvAI initiative," aimed at bridging the AI talent gap in India by empowering young developers, is a collaboration between which entities?**

(a)  The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and IIT Jodhpur
(b)  Meta, MeitY, and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)
(c)  The UGC and the National Research Foundation (NRF)
(d)  The Department of Social Justice and Empowerment (DoSJE) and NALSA

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that the "YuvAI initiative" is a partnership between Meta (a technology company), MeitY (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology), and AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education).  The other options are incorrect:  the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and IIT Jodhpur are involved in other initiatives, the UGC and NRF focus on higher education and research, and DoSJE and NALSA deal with social justice and legal services.  The collaboration between Meta, MeitY, and AICTE highlights the public-private partnership approach to addressing the skills gap in emerging technologies, a crucial aspect of India's digital economy strategy.

(d) The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, adopted in 2005 in Paris, is the only international treaty specifically addressing doping in sports.  It aims to create a level playing field by harmonizing anti-doping rules, regulations, and legislation globally.  While the World Anti-Doping Code is a significant document setting standards, it lacks the legal force of an international treaty. The Olympic Charter focuses on the governance of the Olympic movement, and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act is a national law, not an international treaty.  The UNESCO Convention's importance lies in its international legal framework, promoting cooperation and consistency in the fight against doping across nations.  Its ratification by countries signifies a commitment to a unified approach to this issue, strengthening global anti-doping efforts and ensuring a fair and equitable sporting environment worldwide. This legal framework transcends the limitations of individual national laws and organizational codes, providing a robust foundation for international cooperation and enforcement.


**2.  The Indian government launched a project to establish support centers for a specific demographic. Which project aims to provide dedicated support and services to Defence Pensioners, Veterans, and their families?**

(a) ASMITA Project
(b) Project NAMAN
(c) Bahubhasha Shabdkosh
(d) Real-time Translation Architecture

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project NAMAN, implemented by the Indian Army, is specifically designed to provide comprehensive support and services to Defence Pensioners, Veterans, and their families.  It leverages SPARSH (System for Pension Administration Raksha) to streamline access to essential services.  The other options are unrelated; ASMITA focuses on multilingual education, while Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is a multilingual dictionary repository, and Real-time Translation Architecture is a technological initiative.  Project NAMAN's significance lies in its targeted approach to supporting a vulnerable population, ensuring their well-being and access to necessary resources.  This initiative demonstrates a commitment to the welfare of those who have served the nation, highlighting the government's dedication to providing post-service care and support to veterans and their families.  The use of SPARSH further enhances efficiency and transparency in the delivery of pension and other related services.


**3.  A national campaign promotes ethical conduct in sports. What is the name of the campaign conducted by NADA to commemorate WADA’s Play True Day?**

(a)  Khelo India
(b)  Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS)
(c)  #PlayTrue Campaign
(d)  Alliance for Global Good

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The #PlayTrue Campaign is specifically conducted by the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) of India to commemorate the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) Play True Day. This campaign raises awareness about anti-doping rules and guidelines, promoting clean sports and fair play.  The other options represent distinct initiatives; Khelo India and TOPS are sports development programs, and the Alliance for Global Good focuses on gender equity. The #PlayTrue Campaign is vital in fostering a culture of integrity and ethical conduct in sports.  By actively promoting awareness and education, NADA contributes to a global effort to combat doping and uphold the principles of fair competition. The campaign's success depends on its reach and ability to influence athletes' behavior, ensuring that they understand and comply with anti-doping regulations.  This initiative is part of a larger global movement aiming to maintain the credibility and integrity of sports.


**4.  India's National Sports Policy, 2024, aims to achieve holistic national development through sports. Which of the following is NOT a pillar of this policy?**

(a) Excellence on the Global Stage
(b) Sports for Economic Development
(c) Sports for Social Development
(d)  Promotion of specific sports like Cricket and Hockey

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the National Sports Policy 2024 aims for excellence in sports, economic development through sports, and social development using sports, it does not focus on promoting specific sports like cricket and hockey to the exclusion of others.  The policy's broad vision is to harness the power of sports for holistic national development.  The policy promotes inclusivity and aims to develop a wide range of sports, not just a select few.  The other options are central pillars of the policy, outlining its key objectives and strategies for achieving its goals. The policy's inclusive approach seeks to support the development of diverse sports disciplines, promoting participation and excellence across the board, rather than favoring particular sports.  This holistic approach recognizes the potential of sports to contribute to various aspects of national development, from economic growth to social inclusion and global competitiveness.


**5.  A new initiative aims to make high-quality study materials available in various Indian languages.  Which project is designed to achieve this goal?**

(a) Project NAMAN
(b) Bahubhasha Shabdkosh
(c) Real-time Translation Architecture
(d) ASMITA Project

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The ASMITA (Augmenting Study Materials in Indian languages through Translation and Academic writing) Project directly addresses the goal of making high-quality study materials accessible in various Indian languages.  It aims to produce 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages within five years.  While Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is a multilingual dictionary and the other options are focused on different areas, ASMITA's core objective is to improve the quality and availability of educational resources in regional languages. This initiative is crucial for promoting multilingualism and ensuring equitable access to education across different linguistic groups in India.  By translating and creating high-quality study materials, ASMITA empowers students from diverse linguistic backgrounds and promotes inclusivity within the education system.  The project's success depends on its ability to produce accurate and engaging educational content, ensuring that students receive the same quality of education regardless of their native language.


**1.  A global initiative aimed at eradicating hunger and poverty, launched at the 2024 G20 Leaders’ Summit in Brazil, operates through a three-pillar framework.  Which of the following accurately describes this initiative's core components?**

(a) National policies, international funding, and technological solutions.
(b) National strategies, financial mobilization, and knowledge sharing.
(c) Regional cooperation, private investment, and technological advancements.
(d) Global partnerships, sustainable agriculture, and nutritional programs.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, launched at the G20 Summit in Brazil, focuses on three pillars: National, Financial, and Knowledge.  The "National" pillar refers to national strategies and policies implemented by participating countries to address hunger and poverty within their own borders. The "Financial" pillar emphasizes the mobilization of financial resources, both public and private, to support these national initiatives. Finally, the "Knowledge" pillar highlights the importance of sharing best practices, research findings, and expertise to improve the effectiveness of anti-hunger and anti-poverty programs. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain elements that are partially relevant but do not accurately reflect the specific three-pillar structure of the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty.  Option (a) is too broad, (c) is geographically limited, and (d) focuses on specific strategies rather than the core organizational framework.  The emphasis on policy instruments and neutral facilitation within the Alliance further supports the accuracy of option (b).


**2.  A report released by five UN specialized agencies assesses global food security and nutrition.  Which of the following organizations is NOT involved in producing this annual report?**

(a) World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
(c) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(d) World Food Programme (WFP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report is jointly produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the World Health Organization (WHO).  The UNDP, while involved in other development-related reports and initiatives, is not a contributor to this specific annual report on food security and nutrition. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all correctly identified as participating organizations.  The report's focus on financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition reinforces the involvement of the agencies explicitly concerned with food production, distribution, and health outcomes.


**3.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in India employs a multi-faceted evaluation system for educational institutions. Which of the following is NOT a core parameter used by NIRF for ranking?**

(a) Teaching, Learning, and Resources
(b) Research and Professional Practices
(c) Global Impact and International Collaborations
(d) Graduation Outcomes

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NIRF uses five core parameters: Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception. While international collaborations and global impact might influence an institution's overall standing, they are not explicitly listed as separate, independent parameters within the NIRF framework.  The other options are all components of the NIRF ranking system.  The addition of "Innovation" ranking and new categories like Open Universities and Skill Universities in 2024 demonstrates the framework's evolution, but the core parameters remain consistent.  The focus on domestic factors in the evaluation highlights the NIRF's prioritization of India-centric performance indicators.

(c)  Defining pandemic emergencies based on geographical spread and national health system capacity.
(d)  Establishment of National IHR Authorities to improve coordination among countries.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The WHA amendments focused on strengthening the IHR framework by clarifying definitions, enhancing coordination, and improving resource allocation.  The amendments include defining pandemic emergencies based on geographical spread and the ability of national health systems to respond, establishing a States Parties Committee for effective implementation, and creating National IHR Authorities to improve coordination. The establishment of a dedicated Global Health Emergency Fund was not part of these specific amendments, although the need for improved financial mechanisms was addressed through a Coordinating Financial Mechanism. The other options accurately reflect the key changes adopted by the WHA to improve global pandemic preparedness and response.  The amendments' focus on strengthening existing structures rather than creating entirely new ones is a key takeaway.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Science and Technology,  following all specified instructions.  Note that due to the nature of the provided text,  questions directly related to specific scientific or technological advancements are limited.  Therefore, the questions focus on the organizational and policy aspects related to science and technology in India.


**1.  Which entity is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)?**

(a) The University Grants Commission (UGC)
(b) The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in collaboration with INFLIBNET Centre
(c) The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD)
(d) The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Board of Accreditation (NBA), in collaboration with the INFLIBNET Centre in Gandhinagar, is the implementing agency for NIRF.  The UGC plays a role in higher education but isn't directly responsible for NIRF implementation. The MHRD (now Ministry of Education) launched NIRF, but the NBA and INFLIBNET handle the operational aspects of ranking.  AICTE focuses on technical education, not the broader NIRF framework.  The NBA's role is crucial as it assesses the qualitative competence of educational programs, aligning with NIRF's goals of evaluating institutions based on various parameters.  The collaboration with INFLIBNET ensures technological support and data management for the ranking process.

While the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 recommended the creation of such a foundation, it wasn't the legal instrument for its establishment. The other options are irrelevant to the ANRF's legal framework.  The passage of this specific act highlights the government's commitment to the ANRF's goals and provides it with the legal authority to operate.  This dedicated act underscores the importance of the ANRF in the national research landscape.


**4.  Which international organization's convention does India have signed and ratified, concerning anti-doping in sports?**

(a) The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code
(b) The International Olympic Committee (IOC) Charter
(c) The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport
(d) The Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  India has signed and ratified the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport.  While WADA plays a significant role in anti-doping efforts globally, its Code is not a legally binding international treaty.  The IOC Charter deals with the governance of the Olympic movement, not specifically anti-doping legislation. The Council of Europe Convention is another significant instrument, but the provided text specifically mentions India's ratification of the UNESCO Convention.  This ratification demonstrates India's commitment to international standards in combating doping and ensuring fair play in sports.


**5.  Which governmental body issued a Letter of Intent (LoI) to the University of Southampton to establish a campus in India?**

(a) The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)
(b) The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)
(c) The University Grants Commission (UGC)
(d) The Ministry of Science and Technology (MST)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UGC issued the LoI to the University of Southampton, reflecting its role in regulating and facilitating the entry of foreign higher educational institutions into India. The MEA deals with international relations, AICTE focuses on technical education, and MST deals with science and technology, making their involvement in this specific instance less relevant.  The UGC's action is in line with the National Education Policy 2020's aim to internationalize higher education in India and demonstrates the government's commitment to attracting high-quality foreign universities.

Its findings directly contribute to achieving SDG 12.3 targets, specifically 12.3.1 (b) which aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either limit the report's scope geographically, focus on a single aspect of the impact, or neglect the consumer and retail levels of food waste.  The report's holistic approach to tracking food waste across various stages makes it a crucial tool for informed policymaking and interventions.


**4.  The recent amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, primarily aimed to:**

(a)  Reduce the WHO's budget.
(b)  Strengthen global preparedness and response mechanisms for public health emergencies, including defining pandemic emergencies and establishing financial mechanisms.
(c)  Limit the sovereignty of individual nations in handling health crises.
(d)  Focus solely on the prevention of viral outbreaks.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The amendments to the IHR, 2005, were a direct response to the shortcomings exposed by past epidemics and pandemics. The key changes focused on enhancing global preparedness and response capabilities. This includes a clearer definition of pandemic emergencies, establishment of financial mechanisms to support developing countries, and improved coordination among nations.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the amendments' purpose. The amendments are designed to be collaborative, not restrictive, and address a broad range of public health emergencies, not just viral outbreaks. The improvements in response mechanisms are crucial for effective global health security.


**5.  The key highlight of the Supreme Court's judgement in the Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others case concerning nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes involved:**

(a)  Granting them special economic privileges.
(b)  Striking down caste-based discrimination within prisons against Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and "habitual offenders," violating Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23 of the Constitution.
(c)  Providing them with exclusive access to forest resources.
(d)  Relocating them to urban areas.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court's landmark ruling in the Sukanya Santha case focused on dismantling the unconstitutional caste-based discrimination within prison systems.  The court recognized the systemic injustices faced by DNTs and "habitual offenders," highlighting the violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality before law), 15 (prohibition of discrimination), 17 (abolition of untouchability), 21 (protection of life and personal liberty), and 23 (prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour). Options (a), (c), and (d) are outside the scope of this specific judgement, which primarily dealt with the issue of discriminatory practices within prisons.  The ruling represents a significant step towards ensuring equality and justice for marginalized communities.


**6.  In the context of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, which statement is correct?**

(a) Surrogacy is now completely banned in India.
(b)  The use of donor gametes (egg or sperm) is still strictly prohibited.
(c)  Single women (widows or divorcees) can only undergo surrogacy using their own eggs and donor sperm, subject to specific conditions.
(d)  The amendment has no impact on the requirements for surrogacy.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced significant changes, including allowing the use of donor gametes under specific medical conditions certified by a District Medical Board. However, for single women (widows or divorcees), the use of self-eggs and donor sperm is mandated. This reflects a nuanced approach to surrogacy, balancing ethical considerations with the needs of individuals facing infertility. Options (a), (b), and (d) are inaccurate.  The amendments significantly alter the rules, allowing for donor gametes in certain cases while maintaining specific restrictions for single women. The amendment highlights the ongoing evolution of surrogacy regulations in India.

In fact, India's relatively poor ranking highlights the continued challenges in addressing hunger and malnutrition.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are accurately reflected in the report's findings. The report's data underscore the need for continued efforts to improve nutritional outcomes and reduce hunger in India.  The report provides a critical assessment of the country's progress in achieving Zero Hunger.


**9.  Which of the following is NOT a key dimension considered in the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)?**

(a)  Health and Survival
(b)  Economic Participation and Opportunity
(c)  Political Empowerment
(d)  Environmental Sustainability

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The GGGI focuses on four key dimensions: Health and Survival, Educational Attainment, Economic Participation and Opportunity, and Political Empowerment. Environmental sustainability is not explicitly included as a core dimension in the GGGI's framework.  The index's focus is on gender parity across several critical societal areas.  While environmental issues are important, they are not directly part of the GGGI's specific indicators.  The index provides a valuable framework for assessing gender equality progress in different countries.

(a)  The complete abolishment of the WHO's role in global health emergencies.
(b)  The establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism to assist developing countries.
(c)  The removal of all legal obligations for member states regarding pandemic preparedness.
(d)  The exclusion of communicable diseases from the definition of pandemic emergencies.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that one of the key amendments to the IHR, 2005, is the establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism to address the needs and priorities of developing countries.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. The amendments aim to strengthen the WHO's role, not abolish it; they maintain, not remove, member state obligations; and they explicitly define pandemic emergencies to include communicable diseases with wide geographical spread. The amendments reflect lessons learned from past outbreaks like Ebola and COVID-19, highlighting the need for improved international cooperation and resource allocation to enhance global pandemic preparedness and response.  The creation of a States Parties Committee and National IHR Authorities further underscores the commitment to enhanced implementation and coordination.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The report indicates that India's GHI score is 27.3, while the world's average is 18.3.  Therefore, statement (d) is false.  India's score is higher than the global average, placing it in the "serious" category. The other statements (a, b, and c) are supported by the text: India's score has improved since 2000; it falls under the "serious" category; and child wasting and stunting remain high. The GHI report highlights the ongoing challenges in tackling hunger and malnutrition in India, despite some progress.  The persistence of high rates of child wasting and stunting underscores the need for sustained and comprehensive interventions addressing underlying factors such as poverty, inequality, and inadequate healthcare access. The report also emphasizes the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition, highlighting the importance of maternal health and nutrition.


**6.  The  "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains: An Opportunity for Gender Impact" report was launched by which organization?**

(a) The World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c) The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d) The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) launched the report titled ‘The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains: An Opportunity for Gender Impact.’  The report focuses on promoting nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to reduce gender inequalities and enhance business resilience.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are other significant international organizations working on health and nutrition, but they are not the ones responsible for launching this specific report. This report highlights the interconnectedness of nutrition, gender equality, and economic development.  Investing in nutritious foods value chains can have a significant impact on improving nutritional outcomes, particularly for women and girls, while also promoting economic growth and resilience. The report's findings underscore the importance of considering gender dynamics in designing and implementing nutrition interventions.


**7.  Which Act was repealed in 1949, leading to the denotification of "criminal tribes" in 1952?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act
(b) The Protection of Civil Rights Act
(c) The Criminal Tribes Act
(d) The Untouchability (Offences) Act

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed in 1949. This repeal was followed by the denotification of the "criminal tribes" in 1952.  The other options are related to social justice and the protection of marginalized communities but are not the act that was directly repealed.  The repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act was a significant step towards addressing historical injustices and social stigmatization faced by denotified tribes. However, the legacy of this act continues to impact the lives of these communities, highlighting the need for sustained efforts to promote social inclusion and address ongoing discrimination. The Idate Commission's recommendations further emphasize the need to dismantle discriminatory legal frameworks that perpetuate social inequalities.


**8.  The Aadharshila curriculum, launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, is designed for which age group?**

(a)  Children aged 0-3 years
(b)  Children aged 3-6 years
(c)  Children aged 6-9 years
(d)  Children aged 9-12 years

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions that Aadharshila is a 48-week curriculum for children aged three to six years old in anganwadis.  The curriculum aims to provide a strong foundation for learning and development during these crucial early years. Options (a), (c), and (d) represent different age groups, but they are not the target audience for the Aadharshila curriculum.  The curriculum's design incorporates play-based learning and activities to facilitate a smooth transition from home to the anganwadi setting. The focus on early childhood care and education underscores the importance of investing in a child's formative years to ensure their holistic development and future well-being.  The curriculum's success will depend on effective teacher training, resource availability, and community engagement.

The text describes the ASMITA (Augmenting Study Materials in Indian languages through Translation and Academic writing) Project as aiming to ensure that students have access to high-quality study materials in their native languages.  It plans to produce 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages over five years. Options (a), (c), and (d) are important aspects of education but are not the central focus of the ASMITA project.  The project’s emphasis on multilingualism aligns with the NEP 2020's vision of promoting mother-tongue based education. The initiative's success will depend on the quality of translations, effective distribution mechanisms, and the availability of trained teachers capable of using these resources effectively. The project represents a significant step towards making quality education accessible to all students, irrespective of their linguistic background.


**10. Project NAMAN, launched by the Indian Army, primarily aims to provide support to which group of people?**

(a)  Active-duty military personnel
(b)  Families of deceased soldiers
(c)  Defence pensioners, veterans, and their families
(d)  Civilian employees of the Ministry of Defence

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that Project NAMAN aims to provide dedicated support and services to Defence Pensioners, Veterans, and their families through the SPARSH (System for Pension Administration Raksha) system. Options (a), (b), and (d) represent other groups associated with the Indian Army and Ministry of Defence, but they are not the primary beneficiaries of Project NAMAN. The project’s focus on pensioners and veterans underscores the importance of providing continued support and welfare to those who have served the nation. The use of SPARSH-centric Common Service Centres (CSCs) highlights a commitment to utilizing technology to improve service delivery and accessibility.  The success of Project NAMAN will depend on effective coordination among various stakeholders and the capacity of the CSCs to provide timely and efficient support.

(b) POSHAN Abhiyan
(c) Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme
(d) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojna

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme" is a centrally sponsored scheme focused on the socio-economic development of PVTGs.  The other options are related to food security and maternal health, respectively, and are not directly focused on PVTG development.


**10.  A Supreme Court judgment addressed caste-based discrimination within prisons, particularly affecting certain vulnerable tribal groups. Which vulnerable tribal group was primarily the subject of this Supreme Court case, concerning caste-based discrimination within prison walls?**

(a)  Juangs
(b)  Dongria Kondhs
(c) Denotified Tribes (DNTs)
(d) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court case, *Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others*, specifically addressed caste-based discrimination against Denotified Tribes (DNTs) within prisons. While PVTGs (d) also face discrimination, this particular case focused on DNTs.  Juangs (a) and Dongria Kondhs (b) are specific tribal groups, not the overall focus of the judgment.


**1.  A government initiative aims to comprehensively address the socio-economic development of specific tribal groups while preserving their cultural heritage.  Which of the following best describes this initiative's central objective?**

(a)  Promoting tourism in tribal areas to generate revenue.
(b)  Assimilating tribal communities into mainstream society.
(c)  Ensuring the comprehensive socio-economic development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) while safeguarding their culture and heritage.
(d)  Providing financial assistance to states for infrastructure development in tribal regions.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes the 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme. Option (c) accurately reflects the scheme's primary goal: holistic socio-economic advancement of PVTGs while respecting and maintaining their cultural identity. Option (a) is a secondary benefit, not the central objective. Option (b) contradicts the scheme's aim of preserving cultural heritage. Option (d) is a component of the scheme, not the overarching objective.  The scheme's success is judged by the extent to which it improves the lives of PVTGs without undermining their unique cultural practices and traditions. This requires a multi-pronged approach, encompassing education, housing, agricultural development, and infrastructure improvements, all while respecting the group's cultural identity.  This nuanced understanding of the scheme's objective is crucial for UPSC-level analysis.


**2.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006 grants a specific type of right to certain tribal communities.  Which of the following correctly identifies this right and the communities it primarily benefits?**

(a)  Land ownership rights for all forest-dwelling communities.
(b)  Habitat rights for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.
(c)  Exclusive fishing rights in forest areas.
(d)  Rights to collect non-timber forest produce for all tribal groups.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The FRA, specifically Section 3(1)(e), addresses habitat rights.  These rights are not universal to all forest-dwelling communities (a) but are focused on PVTGs and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes who traditionally depend on specific forest areas for their livelihoods.  While the FRA encompasses other rights (c and d), the core of the question points to habitat rights as the central focus and the specific target groups benefiting from this provision.  Understanding the nuances of the FRA is vital for answering UPSC questions on tribal rights and forest conservation.  The FRA's significance lies in its recognition of the historical and customary relationship between tribal communities and forest lands, going beyond mere resource access to encompass their very way of life.  The habitat right recognizes this deep-rooted connection.



**3. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) report highlights a critical link between several factors and the prevalence of hunger. Which of the following sets of factors is most accurately reflected in the report's findings?**

(a)  Economic growth, technological advancement, and food production.
(b)  Agricultural subsidies, international trade policies, and food prices.
(c)  Gender inequality, climate change, and conflict.
(d)  Population density, urbanization, and access to healthcare.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The GHI report explicitly emphasizes the interconnectedness of gender inequality, climate change, and conflict in exacerbating hunger.  While other factors (a, b, and d) play a role in food security, the report directly highlights the disproportionate impact of gender inequality on food insecurity and malnutrition, the vulnerability of communities to climate change impacts, and the disruptive effects of conflict on food systems.  Understanding this complex interplay is crucial for analyzing global food security challenges and formulating effective interventions. The report's findings underscore the need for comprehensive, multi-sectoral approaches that address the root causes of hunger, rather than focusing solely on food production or economic growth.  This holistic perspective is a key element in UPSC-style questions on global development.

(a)  The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) and SDG 1 and 2.
(b)  The Food Waste Index Report (FWI) and SDG 12.3.1 (a) and (b).
(c)  The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report and SDG 2.
(d)  The Global Nutrition Report and SDG 3.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Food Waste Index Report (FWI) directly supports the achievement of SDG 12.3.1 (a) and (b), focusing on reducing food losses and halving per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels. While other reports (a, c, and d) address aspects of food security and nutrition, the FWI specifically targets food waste reduction as a crucial element of sustainable development.  The FWI's focus on specific indicators within SDG 12 highlights the importance of data-driven approaches to tackling global challenges.  UPSC often assesses candidates' understanding of the SDGs and their interconnectedness.  Knowing which reports address which specific SDG indicators shows the candidate's ability to apply this knowledge to policy analysis.



**5.  Several initiatives in India aim to address the nutritional needs of vulnerable populations.  Which of the following programs focuses on providing free food grains to a significant portion of the poor population?**

(a)  Poshan 2.0
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(c)  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) is explicitly designed to provide free food grains to a large segment of the impoverished population in India.  While other programs (a, b, and c) address various aspects of nutrition and food security, only PMGKAY directly tackles food insecurity by offering free rations.  The PMGKAY's scale and impact on poverty alleviation are significant considerations in UPSC-related discussions on social welfare schemes.  Understanding the specific aims and target groups of different social welfare programs demonstrates a candidate's ability to analyze government policies and their effectiveness.  The scale of the PMGKAY, its reach, and its impact on reducing hunger among the poor are all crucial elements in assessing its success.


**6. A significant Supreme Court judgment addressed discriminatory practices within prisons.  Which case and which constitutional articles were central to this ruling?**

(a)  The Kesavananda Bharati case and Articles 14 and 21.
(b)  The Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others case and Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23.
(c)  The Minerva Mills case and Articles 32 and 14.
(d)  The Shah Bano case and Articles 44 and 21.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others case specifically addressed caste-based discrimination within prisons, striking down provisions that violated Articles 14 (equality before the law), 15 (prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth), 17 (abolition of untouchability), 21 (protection of life and personal liberty), and 23 (prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour).  While other cases (a, c, and d) are landmark judgments, they do not directly relate to the specific issue of caste-based discrimination within the prison system.  Understanding this case highlights the candidate's awareness of judicial pronouncements on social justice issues and their constitutional basis.  The judgment's significance lies in its reaffirmation of fundamental rights within the confines of prison walls, ensuring equal treatment for all prisoners regardless of their caste or background.


**7.  A major government initiative aims to enhance the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods.  What is the name of this initiative?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi
(c)  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(d)  National Rural Livelihoods Mission


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is specifically designed to improve the socio-economic status of tribal communities through a multi-pronged approach.  While other initiatives (a, b, and d) address different aspects of development, only PM-JUGA focuses on comprehensively addressing the needs of tribal communities across multiple sectors.  The PM-JUGA's holistic approach, encompassing infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood enhancement, makes it a significant policy intervention targeting tribal welfare.  Understanding the specific objectives and components of such schemes is crucial for UPSC aspirants.  The name itself reflects the initiative's focus on empowering tribal communities.


**8.  The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has influenced a recent policy initiative in the sports sector. Which policy initiative is directly influenced by NEP 2020?**

(a)  Khelo India Scheme
(b)  Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS)
(c)  Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024
(d)  National Sports Development Code


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024, explicitly aims to harmonize its objectives with those of the NEP 2020, integrating sports with education. While other initiatives (a, b, and d) are significant in the sports sector, only the NSP 2024 directly seeks to align its goals with the NEP 2020's vision of education reform.  This integration is a key aspect of the NSP 2024, reflecting a holistic approach to human development.  Understanding the relationship between different policy initiatives and their alignment with broader national goals is a core competency for UPSC preparation.  The NSP 2024's explicit mention of this integration showcases its forward-looking approach and its commitment to a more comprehensive approach to sports development.


**9.  Which of the following correctly describes the criteria for identifying Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  High population density and significant economic activity.
(b)  Forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural level of existence, stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy.
(c)  Access to modern technology and participation in mainstream development programs.
(d)  Proximity to urban centers and involvement in industrial employment.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The criteria for identifying PVTGs explicitly include forest-based livelihoods, a pre-agricultural level of existence, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy rates, and a subsistence economy.  These characteristics highlight the vulnerability of these groups and their dependence on traditional practices and resources.  Options (a, c, and d) represent the opposite of the conditions that define PVTGs.  Understanding these criteria demonstrates a candidate's knowledge of the unique challenges faced by PVTGs and the rationale behind their designation.  This knowledge is crucial for analyzing government policies aimed at protecting and empowering these vulnerable communities.  The specific characteristics listed in (b) are essential for recognizing the distinctive vulnerabilities of PVTGs, setting them apart from other tribal groups.


**10.  A global alliance promotes nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to reduce gender inequalities, increase productivity, and enhance business resilience.  Which organization is responsible for this initiative?**

(a)  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(b)  The World Food Programme (WFP)
(c)  The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d)  The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) launched a report focused on nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to address gender inequalities, enhance productivity, and improve business resilience.  While other organizations (a, b, and d) work on related issues, only GAIN is specifically responsible for this initiative.  This question tests the candidate's awareness of key players in global nutrition and development.  Understanding the roles and functions of various international organizations is crucial for analyzing global development strategies and policies.  GAIN's focus on the agri-food sector's role in improving nutrition highlights the importance of integrating nutrition considerations into broader development agendas.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to assess various cognitive skills relevant to the UPSC exam.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  A government initiative aims to provide free food grains to a significant portion of the Indian population. Which program directly addresses this objective?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(b) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(c) Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana
(d) National Food Security Act, 2013


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) is explicitly designed to provide free food grains to approximately 80 crore (800 million) poor individuals in India.  Options (a) and (b), while related to nutrition and welfare, focus on maternal health and supplementary nutrition for children respectively.  The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, establishes the right to food as a legal entitlement but doesn't directly provide free grains on the scale of PMGKAY. The PMGKAY represents a direct, large-scale intervention to address food insecurity, making it the most appropriate answer.  The other options, while important components of India's nutritional strategy, do not focus primarily on providing free food grains to such a vast population.


**2.  Consider a community characterized by forest-based livelihoods, a pre-agricultural existence, a declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy.  Which specific governmental designation best applies to such a group?**

(a) Denotified Tribes (DNTs)
(b) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
(c) Scheduled Tribes (STs)
(d) Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description perfectly matches the criteria used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  The government uses several factors to designate a group as PVTG, including the characteristics mentioned in the question.  DNTs are communities historically labeled as "criminal tribes," a distinct category.  While many PVTGs might also be STs, the PVTG designation highlights their unique vulnerability and requires specific government support. Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes describe a lifestyle, not necessarily a vulnerability status.  Therefore, PVTGs are the most accurate categorization for the described community, reflecting their unique socio-economic conditions and the need for targeted interventions.


**3.  A report assesses global hunger levels, highlighting the challenges in achieving the "Zero Hunger" goal by 2030 and linking hunger to gender inequality and climate change.  Which report is being described?**

(a) Food Waste Index Report
(b) State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report
(c) Global Report on Food Crises
(d) Global Hunger Index


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) directly addresses global hunger levels, assessing progress towards "Zero Hunger" and analyzing the multifaceted factors contributing to hunger, including gender inequality and climate change.  The other reports focus on different aspects of food security and nutrition. The Food Waste Index Report deals with food waste, the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report examines broader food security issues, and the Global Report on Food Crises focuses on acute food crises.  Only the GHI comprehensively covers the aspects mentioned in the question, making it the correct answer.


**4. The act of using banned substances to gain an unfair advantage in sports competitions is known as:**

(a)  Sports Enhancement
(b)  Performance Augmentation
(c)  Doping
(d)  Competitive Advantage


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

"Doping" is the established term for the use of banned substances or methods to improve athletic performance.  While the other options describe related concepts, they are not the standard and widely accepted terminology in the context of sports regulations and anti-doping efforts.  The term "doping" carries a specific legal and ethical weight, encompassing the violation of rules and the pursuit of unfair advantage.   Therefore, "doping" is the only accurate and precise term among the given options.


**5. Which organization publishes an annual report that ranks educational institutions in India based on teaching, learning resources, research, graduation outcomes, outreach, inclusivity, and perception, recently including a new category for innovation?**

(a) QS Quacquarelli Symonds
(b) Times Higher Education (THE)
(c) National Board of Accreditation (NBA)
(d)  Ministry of Education


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is implemented by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in collaboration with INFLIBNET Centre.  While the Ministry of Education launches the rankings, the NBA is the implementing agency responsible for the methodology and the ranking process itself.  QS and THE are international organizations that produce global university rankings, not specifically focused on India's educational institutions in the manner described.  Therefore, the NBA is the correct answer as it directly manages the NIRF process.


**6.  A scheme aims to comprehensively develop Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) while preserving their culture and heritage.  Which scheme is described?**

(a) PM-JUGA (Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan)
(b)  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme
(c) PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
(d) PM Gram Sadak Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme" directly targets the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs while emphasizing the preservation of their cultural identity.  PM-JUGA is a broader initiative encompassing various aspects of tribal development, but it doesn't exclusively focus on PVTGs in the way the dedicated PVTG scheme does.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) focuses on housing, and PM Gram Sadak Yojana targets rural road connectivity, both of which are components of broader tribal development strategies but not the primary aim of a scheme dedicated solely to PVTGs.  Therefore, the dedicated PVTG scheme is the most precise and relevant answer.


**7.  The act of granting rights to specific tribal groups to use and manage their customary habitats within reserved and protected forests is known as:**

(a)  Forest Rights
(b)  Tribal Land Rights
(c)  Habitat Rights
(d)  Indigenous Land Ownership


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text specifically describes "Habitat Rights" as granted under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), to PVTGs. While forest rights are a broader concept encompassing various entitlements, habitat rights are specifically related to the customary habitat usage rights of tribal communities within forest areas.  Tribal land rights and indigenous land ownership are broader concepts that don't perfectly capture the specific legal framework and context of the rights granted under the FRA. Therefore, "Habitat Rights" is the most precise and legally accurate term.

(d) The Asia-Pacific Disability Rights Charter


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is a landmark international treaty aimed at protecting and promoting the rights and full participation of people with disabilities.  Adopted in 2006 and entering into force in 2008, it sets a global standard for disability inclusion. While the Biwako Millennium Framework and the Declaration on Full Participation contribute to the same goal, they are regional or supplementary initiatives, not the primary, overarching international convention.  The Asia-Pacific Disability Rights Charter is not a recognized international framework. The UN-CRPD's significance lies in its comprehensive approach, encompassing various aspects of disability rights, from accessibility and education to employment and participation in political life.  Its adoption signifies a global shift toward recognizing the inherent dignity and equal rights of persons with disabilities.  India is among the 164 signatories, highlighting its commitment to implementing the convention's provisions domestically.

(a)  Mahatma Gandhi
(b)  Birsa Munda
(c)  Subhas Chandra Bose
(d)  Govind Ballabh Pant


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA, also known as Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan, explicitly derives its name from Birsa Munda, a significant tribal leader who spearheaded the Ulgulan movement against British rule.  The scheme's focus on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities directly aligns with Munda's legacy of resistance and advocacy for tribal rights. The other options are incorrect as they represent prominent figures from Indian history, but not directly associated with the naming of this particular scheme.  The choice of Birsa Munda reflects the government's intention to honor a key figure in the struggle for tribal rights and to symbolically link the scheme's objectives with his historical contribution.

(b)  3-6 years
(c)  6-8 years
(d)  8-12 years


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Aadharshila, meaning "foundation stone," is a comprehensive curriculum explicitly designed for early childhood care and education (ECCE) targeting children aged 3-6 years.  It aims to provide a strong foundation for learning during this crucial developmental stage.  The curriculum's focus on play-based learning, holistic development (Panchakosha concept), and the inclusion of children with disabilities underscores its importance in fostering early learning and development. While ECCE encompasses a broader age range (birth to 8 years), Aadharshila specifically addresses the 3-6 year age group.  The other options are incorrect because they do not reflect the specific age range targeted by the Aadharshila curriculum.  The program's emphasis on this critical period of brain development and its detailed, 48-week structure showcase the government's commitment to investing in early childhood care and education to build a strong foundation for future learning.

(a)  UNICEF
(b)  World Food Programme
(c)  GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition)
(d)  FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description perfectly matches the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN).  While UNICEF, the World Food Programme, and the FAO all work on aspects of nutrition and food security, only GAIN specifically fits the description of a Swiss-based NGO focused on improving nutrient access via public-private partnerships.  The question tests knowledge of specific international organizations and their mandates.


**7.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for individuals with disabilities.  This convention, adopted in 2006 and entering into force in 2008, has how many signatories (including India)?**

(a)  100
(b)  150
(c)  164
(d)  200

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question directly asks for the number of signatories to the UN-CRPD, including India. The text explicitly states that there are 164 signatories.  The other options are incorrect, representing inaccurate figures.  This question tests factual recall of a specific number related to an international convention.

The other options list different PVTGs mentioned in the context but not the ones that received recent approval as specified in the question.  This question tests specific factual recall of recent events concerning PVTGs and the FRA.


**10. The Supreme Court's decision in the Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others case addressed discrimination against certain vulnerable groups within prisons.  Which of the following groups were specifically highlighted in this case as facing caste-based discrimination?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes (SCs) only
(b)  Scheduled Tribes (STs) only
(c)  Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and "habitual offenders"
(d)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs) only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question pertains to the Supreme Court case and the groups facing discrimination.  The text explicitly mentions Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and "habitual offenders" as the groups highlighted in the case.

**1.  A global index tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels, contributing to the achievement of a specific Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target by 2030.  Which organization is the custodian of this index, and what is the specific SDG target it supports?**

(a) World Health Organization (WHO); SDG 12.3.1 (a)
(b) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); SDG 12.3.1 (a)
(c) United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); SDG 12.3.1 (b)
(d) World Food Programme (WFP); SDG 12.3.1 (b)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024, launched by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) with WRAP, tracks global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels.  It directly supports SDG 12.3.1 (b), which aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030.  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is responsible for SDG 12.3.1 (a), focusing on reducing food losses along production and supply chains.  The WHO and WFP are involved in broader health and food security initiatives but are not the custodians of this specific index.


**2. The National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates for India are prepared using a specific global standard framework. What is the name of this framework, and which international organizations collaborated in its development?**

(a)  Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study; World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF)
(b) System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011; World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank
(c) System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011; Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Health Organization (WHO), Eurostat
(d)  Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2016;  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW),  National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NHA estimates are derived within the framework of the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011. This is a globally recognized standard for producing health accounts, enabling international comparisons.  The SHA 2011 is a collaborative effort between the OECD, WHO, and Eurostat.  While the MoHFW and NHATS play crucial roles in preparing the Indian NHA estimates, the underlying framework is the SHA 2011.  The GBD Study is a different initiative focusing on disease burden.


**3.  Which of the following initiatives is NOT directly associated with addressing hunger and malnutrition in India?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)
(b) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)

(d) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  PMGKAY, PMMVY, and Saksham Anganwadi/Poshan 2.0 are all Indian government programs aimed at improving food security and nutrition.  PMGKAY provides free food grains, PMMVY offers financial assistance and nutritional support to mothers, and Saksham Anganwadi/Poshan 2.0 focuses on supplementary nutrition. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), while important for overall national development, is not directly focused on tackling hunger and malnutrition. Its mandate is broader, encompassing research and innovation across various sectors.


**4. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 highlights a correlation between several factors and the severity of global hunger. Which of the following factors is NOT explicitly mentioned as a key contributor to hunger in the GHI report?**

(a) Gender inequality
(b) Climate change
(c) Technological advancements in agriculture
(d) Weather extremes and climate emergencies

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The GHI 2024 report specifically points out the links between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.  Weather extremes and climate emergencies are highlighted as factors exacerbating food insecurity and malnutrition.  While technological advancements in agriculture can play a role in food security, the GHI report does not explicitly mention it as a key contributor to the *severity* of global hunger in this specific instance.  The report emphasizes the negative impacts of other factors.


**5.  Two prominent global rankings assess the performance of universities worldwide.  Identify the organizations responsible for publishing the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings and the QS World University Rankings.**

(a)  Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) and the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
(b) Times Higher Education (THE) and the National Board of Accreditation (NBA)
(c) Times Higher Education (THE) and Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)
(d)  National Board of Accreditation (NBA) and INFLIBNET Centre

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings are published by Times Higher Education, while the QS World University Rankings are released by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS).  The NIRF and NBA are involved in India's national ranking framework, but not the global rankings mentioned.  INFLIBNET Centre collaborates with the NBA on the NIRF.


**1.  A global collective of governments, industry, and development organizations aims to share best practices and investments in women's health, education, and enterprise.  What is the name of this collective?**

(a)  The Global Partnership for Women's Empowerment
(b)  The Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality
(c)  The International Women's Development Initiative
(d)  The Global Fund for Women's Rights

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality is explicitly mentioned in the provided text as a collective launched in Davos 2024 with the endorsement of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and India.  It's designed to foster collaboration and investment in improving the lives of women globally. Option (a) is a plausible distractor, as it accurately describes the collective's goal, but it's not the actual name. Options (c) and (d) are similarly plausible but incorrect names. The question tests factual recall and understanding of global initiatives related to gender equality and development.  The difficulty lies in distinguishing the correct name from similar-sounding, thematically appropriate alternatives.


**2.  Which legal instrument defines countries' rights and obligations in handling public health emergencies that could cross borders, and which organization is responsible for its adoption and amendment?**

(a)  The International Health Code; World Trade Organization (WTO)
(b)  The International Sanitary Regulations;  International Red Cross (IRC)
(c)  The International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005; World Health Organization (WHO)
(d)  The Global Health Security Agenda;  G20

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 serve as a legally binding framework for managing cross-border public health events.  The World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), is explicitly mentioned as the entity responsible for amending the IHR.  The other options present plausible but incorrect combinations of legal instruments and international organizations.  This question assesses factual recall and understanding of international public health governance.  The difficulty stems from the need to accurately recall both the legal instrument's name and the responsible organization.


**3.  The Supreme Court of India struck down provisions in several states' prison manuals that discriminated against certain groups. Which groups were primarily affected by these discriminatory provisions, and which constitutional articles were violated?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes; Articles 14 and 17
(b)  Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and "habitual offenders"; Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23
(c)  Adivasis; Articles 15 and 21
(d)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs); Articles 14 and 15

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text specifically mentions the Supreme Court case *Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others*, which addressed caste-based discrimination in prisons against Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and "habitual offenders."  The judgment cited violations of Articles 14 (equality before the law), 15 (prohibition of discrimination), 17 (abolition of untouchability), 21 (right to life), and 23 (prohibition of forced labor). The other options offer plausible distractors, including other vulnerable groups and relevant constitutional articles, but they do not accurately reflect the specific groups and articles involved in the mentioned Supreme Court case.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of judicial pronouncements related to the rights of marginalized communities. The difficulty lies in the precise recall of the affected groups and the specific constitutional articles violated.


**4.  What Act aims to prevent and address sexual harassment of women in the workplace, and what key committees does it establish to handle complaints?**

(a)  The Equal Remuneration Act;  National Commission for Women (NCW)
(b)  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act); Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) and Local Complaints Committees (LCCs)
(c)  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA);  State Women's Commissions
(d)  The Indian Penal Code (IPC);  Police Stations

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly names the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) and details its mechanism for handling complaints through Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) at the workplace level and Local Complaints Committees (LCCs) at the district level.  The other options, while related to women's rights and protection, do not accurately reflect the Act addressing workplace sexual harassment or its complaint mechanisms.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of legislation related to gender equality and workplace safety. The difficulty comes from the need to correctly identify the specific Act and its distinct complaint handling structures.


**5.  What is the name of the Act that provides legal guardianship and support for individuals with certain disabilities, and what are some of the disabilities it covers?**

(a)  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016;  Visual and hearing impairments only
(b)  The National Trust Act, 1999; Autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and multiple disabilities
(c)  The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017;  Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder only
(d)  The Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992;  Physical disabilities primarily

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions the National Trust Act, 1999, and its purpose of providing legal guardianship and support for individuals with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and multiple disabilities.  The other options correctly identify relevant legislation related to disability rights but do not accurately reflect the scope of the National Trust Act. This question tests factual recall and understanding of legislation concerning the rights and welfare of persons with disabilities. The difficulty lies in recognizing the specific Act focused on legal guardianship and the precise range of disabilities it covers.


**6. The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of which specific population group?  What historical figure is the scheme named after?**

(a)  Scheduled Castes;  B.R. Ambedkar
(b)  Other Backward Classes (OBCs);  Jyotirao Phule
(c)  Tribal communities; Birsa Munda
(d)  Rural populations; Mahatma Gandhi

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that PM-JUGA focuses on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  It also explicitly mentions that the scheme is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known for his resistance against British rule.  The other options present plausible distractors, including other marginalized groups and prominent figures from Indian history, but they do not accurately reflect the specific target population and the namesake of PM-JUGA. This question tests factual recall and understanding of government schemes targeting specific marginalized communities. The difficulty stems from the precise recall of the target group and the historical figure associated with the scheme's name.


**7. Which Act grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) and what section of this Act specifically addresses habitat rights?**

(a) The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996; Section 5
(b) The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA); Section 3(1)(e)
(c) The Protection of Scheduled Tribes Act, 1989; Section 4
(d) The National Forest Policy, 1988;  No specific section

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that habitat rights for PVTGs are granted under Section 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA). The other options provide plausible distractors that are related to tribal rights and forest conservation but do not accurately specify the correct Act and section regarding habitat rights for PVTGs.  This question assesses knowledge of specific legislation related to the rights of tribal communities. The difficulty lies in precise recall of both the Act and the specific section addressing habitat rights.


**8.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, was amended in 2021. What key change did the 2021 amendment introduce regarding the gestational period for abortion?**

(a)  It completely banned abortions.
(b)  It reduced the permissible gestational period for abortion.
(c)  It increased the permissible gestational period for abortion under specific circumstances.
(d)  It made no changes to the gestational period.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions that the MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, increased the time period within which abortion may be carried out, particularly for special categories of women.  While the exact details of the gestational limits are provided in a table, the core change is the extension of the permissible period. The other options are incorrect and represent misleading interpretations of the amendment's impact. This question tests factual recall and understanding of legal changes related to reproductive rights. The difficulty involves accurately recalling the direction of change introduced by the amendment.


**9.  Which two states were among the top three states with the largest PVTG populations according to the 2001 census?**

(a)  Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
(b)  Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh
(c)  Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh
(d)  West Bengal and Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh as being among the top three states with the highest PVTG populations based on the 2001 census.  The other options offer plausible geographic distractors but are factually incorrect regarding the top PVTG population states from the given data.  This question tests factual recall of demographic data related to tribal populations in India. The difficulty lies in the precise recall of the states from a list of plausible alternatives.


**10.  In which Supreme Court case was the phrase "adult male" removed from the definition of a perpetrator under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005?**

(a)  Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan
(b)  Indra Sarma v. VKV Sarma
(c)  Hiral P Harsora and ors Vs. Kusum Narottamdas Harsora & Ors
(d)  Shayara Bano v. Union of India

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly mentions the Supreme Court case *Hiral P Harsora and ors Vs. Kusum Narottamdas Harsora & Ors* as the case in which the phrase "adult male" was removed from the definition of the perpetrator under the PWDVA.  The other options are all significant Supreme Court cases related to women's rights but are not connected to the removal of the specific phrase in question. This question tests knowledge of specific Supreme Court judgments related to domestic violence legislation. The difficulty involves recalling the precise case name from a set of plausible, related cases.


**1.  Which initiative aims to enhance the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, drawing inspiration from a previous successful program and utilizing existing Scheduled Tribes development grants?**

(a) Accessible India Campaign
(b) Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(c) Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS)
(d) National Action Plan for Skill Training of PwDs

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) explicitly focuses on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Its design leverages the lessons learned from the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN) program, indicating a deliberate effort to build upon successful initiatives.  Furthermore, the scheme's funding mechanism relies on existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, highlighting a pragmatic approach to resource allocation. Options (a), (c), and (d) address disability welfare, rehabilitation, and skill development, respectively, and are not directly focused on the comprehensive socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities as PM-JUGA is.  The strategic use of existing resources and the learning from past successes are key components distinguishing PM-JUGA from other schemes.  This showcases effective governance and resource optimization, aspects crucial for UPSC examination.


**2.  The  amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, introduced which of the following key mechanisms to strengthen global pandemic preparedness and response?**

(a) A system for tracking individual health data across borders.
(b) A centralized global vaccine distribution network.
(c) A Coordinating Financial Mechanism for developing countries and a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation.
(d) Mandatory quarantine for all international travelers.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The key amendments to the IHR, 2005, highlighted in the provided text,  focus on establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to address the specific needs of developing countries in pandemic response.  This addresses a critical gap in global health security, ensuring equitable access to resources and support.  Simultaneously, the establishment of a States Parties Committee is crucial for effective implementation and monitoring of the IHR, promoting accountability and coordination among nations.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are not directly mentioned as key amendments in the given context. While a global vaccine distribution network and traveler quarantine are relevant concepts in pandemic management, they are not the specific mechanisms introduced through the IHR amendments. The creation of the financial mechanism and the committee demonstrates a shift towards a more equitable and effectively governed global health system, a vital aspect for international relations and global health governance discussions relevant to the UPSC syllabus.


**3.  Which Act, repealed in 1949, historically categorized certain communities as "born criminals," leading to their denotification and subsequent inclusion in other caste categories?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act
(b) The Protection of Human Rights Act
(c) The Criminal Tribes Act
(d) The Untouchability (Offences) Act

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 is the historical legislation that categorized certain nomadic and semi-nomadic communities as "criminal tribes," based on prejudiced assumptions.  This act had severe repercussions, leading to systemic discrimination and marginalization.  Its repeal in 1949 marked a significant step towards rectifying this historical injustice.  The subsequent denotification in 1952 aimed to integrate these communities into mainstream society, although challenges remain.  The other options are unrelated to this historical categorization of communities as inherently criminal.  Understanding the impact of the Criminal Tribes Act and its eventual repeal is vital for comprehending the complexities of caste and social justice in India, a critical area of the UPSC syllabus.  The question tests knowledge of historical legislation and its social consequences.


**4. Which of the following initiatives provides a formal mechanism to assess prior learning gained through non-formal or informal channels, integrating them into the formal education system?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram
(b)  National Skill Development Corporation
(c) Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)
(d) Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) specifically addresses the need to formally acknowledge and validate learning acquired outside traditional educational settings.  It provides a structured process for evaluating skills and knowledge obtained through non-formal or informal means, ensuring that individuals receive appropriate academic credit and recognition.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are broader initiatives focused on overall development, skill development, and primary education, respectively, without the specific focus on formally recognizing prior learning from non-traditional sources.  RPL is a crucial concept in addressing educational equity and inclusivity, aligning with the broader goals of flexible and accessible education systems, a topic frequently appearing in the UPSC examination.


**5. Which international convention, adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, aims to protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities?**

(a) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(b) The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(c) The Convention on the Rights of the Child
(d) The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is the specific international treaty dedicated to the rights of persons with disabilities. It sets out a comprehensive framework for promoting, protecting, and ensuring their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The other options, while important human rights instruments, do not specifically address the rights of persons with disabilities in the same comprehensive manner.  Understanding the UN-CRPD is essential for comprehending India's international human rights obligations and its domestic policies related to disability rights.  This is a key area of overlap between international relations and social justice in the UPSC syllabus.


**6.  The Aadharshila curriculum, launched by which ministry, is a detailed 48-week curriculum for early childhood care and education for children aged three to six?**

(a) Ministry of Human Resource Development
(b) Ministry of Education
(c) Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD)
(d) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) is responsible for the Aadharshila curriculum.  This curriculum is specifically designed for early childhood care and education, aligning with the ministry's mandate to promote the welfare of women and children.  The other ministries have different areas of focus, making them less likely to be responsible for a curriculum aimed at early childhood development.  This question tests knowledge of government ministries and their respective responsibilities, a common element in UPSC examinations.  The focus on early childhood care education highlights the importance of foundational development in human capital formation, a key theme in development economics and social policy.


**7. Which  Supreme Court case highlighted persistent caste-based discrimination in prisons, leading to the striking down of discriminatory provisions in several state prison manuals?**

(a)  Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India
(b)  Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala
(c)  Sukanya Santha v. Union of India & Others
(d)  Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sukanya Santha v. Union of India & Others case specifically addressed caste-based discrimination within prison systems.  The court's decision to strike down discriminatory provisions in several state prison manuals underscores the importance of ensuring equal treatment and rights for all prisoners, regardless of caste.  The other landmark cases are not directly related to prison reform or caste-based discrimination within prison systems. This question tests knowledge of landmark Supreme Court cases and their impact on social justice and equality.  The focus on caste-based discrimination within the prison system highlights the systemic nature of caste-based inequality and its manifestations even in supposedly neutral spaces, a relevant topic for the UPSC syllabus.


**8. Which act prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and adolescents (14-18 years) in specified hazardous occupations, with some exceptions?**

(a) The Right to Education Act
(b) The Juvenile Justice Act
(c) The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act
(d) The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act directly addresses the issue of child labor, prohibiting the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  While the other acts deal with related aspects of child welfare, they do not specifically focus on the prohibition of child labor in the comprehensive manner this act does.  The exceptions included in the act, for example, work in family enterprises, highlight the complexities of balancing child protection with socio-economic realities.  This question tests knowledge of child labor legislation and its nuances, a topic relevant for social justice and governance sections of the UPSC exam.


**9. Which  mechanism, established under the RPwD Act, 2016, allows for joint decision-making between a guardian and a person with a disability, respecting the latter's will and limited to specific situations?**

(a)  Power of Attorney
(b)  Legal Guardianship
(c)  Limited Guardianship
(d)  Welfare Trusteeship

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, introduces the concept of "Limited Guardianship" as a specific mechanism to address the decision-making needs of persons with disabilities who cannot make legally binding decisions even with support.  This approach prioritizes the individual's autonomy and wishes, limiting the guardian's role to specific decisions and timeframes.  The other options, while related to legal frameworks concerning decision-making for vulnerable individuals, do not offer the same balance between protection and autonomy that Limited Guardianship provides.  This question tests knowledge of the provisions of the RPwD Act and its implications for the rights and autonomy of persons with disabilities, a vital aspect of social justice and human rights within the UPSC syllabus.


**10.  The  "Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan" is also known by which other name?**

(a)  National Policy for Persons with Disabilities
(b)  Accessible India Campaign
(c)  National Trust for the Welfare of Persons with Disabilities
(d)  Scheme for Implementing Persons with Disabilities Act

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The "Accessible India Campaign" is the alternative name for the "Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan."  This initiative focuses on making public spaces and services more accessible for persons with disabilities.  The other options represent different initiatives or policies related to disability rights and welfare but are not alternative names for the Accessible India Campaign.  This question tests knowledge of government schemes and initiatives related to disability rights, demonstrating an understanding of government programs and policies, a common theme in the UPSC exam.


**1.  A framework for ranking educational institutions in India, launched in 2015 by the Ministry of Education, uses a multi-faceted approach to assess various aspects of higher education. Which of the following is NOT a parameter used in this framework?**

(a) Teaching, Learning, and Resources
(b) Research and Professional Practices
(c) Student Satisfaction Surveys
(d) Outreach and Inclusivity

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) employs five key parameters to rank educational institutions: Teaching, Learning, and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.  Student satisfaction surveys, while valuable for institutional self-assessment and improvement, are not explicitly included as a primary parameter in the NIRF methodology.

(a) Lebanon; Roumieh Prison
(b) Syria; Saydnaya Prison
(c) Israel; Ramla Prison
(d) Iran; Evin Prison

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Saydnaya Prison is located in Syria.  This prison has been the subject of international concern due to reports of human rights abuses. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect, as they mention prisons located in other countries. The reporting on Saydnaya Prison highlights the broader issue of human rights violations in conflict zones and the importance of international scrutiny of prison conditions globally. The ongoing situation in Syria underscores the need for international cooperation to address human rights abuses and ensure accountability for perpetrators of such violations.


**1.  A government initiative aims to comprehensively improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities while preserving their cultural heritage.  Which of the following schemes best aligns with this objective?**

(a)  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(c)  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme
(d)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) directly addresses the socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities.  Its core objective is to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence and outreach of various schemes.  This holistic approach aims to improve the overall well-being of tribal populations while acknowledging and respecting their cultural identity.  In contrast, the NFSA focuses primarily on food security, the PVTG scheme targets a specific vulnerable group, and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan concentrates solely on education.  While these schemes contribute to the overall well-being of tribal communities, PM-JUGA offers the most comprehensive and direct approach to socio-economic development while safeguarding cultural heritage.  The scheme's design explicitly incorporates the preservation of tribal culture and traditions as a core principle.


**2.  Which of the following states has the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) according to government recognition?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Maharashtra
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, the highest number among all states and union territories in India. This is based on the government's recognition of PVTGs, which is grounded on specific criteria such as forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural existence, stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy, and a subsistence economy.  While Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra also have significant PVTG populations, they do not surpass Odisha's count.  The official recognition of PVTGs is based on rigorous data collection and analysis, making Odisha's position as the state with the highest number of recognized PVTGs a verifiable fact.


**3.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, grants specific rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  Which of the following rights is explicitly provided under the FRA for these groups?**

(a) Right to free education up to the secondary level
(b) Right to participate in local governance bodies
(c) Habitat rights
(d) Right to access government employment schemes

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Section 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) specifically grants habitat rights to PVTGs.  This right encompasses the customary habitat and other habitats within reserved and protected forests.  While the FRA indirectly supports other rights such as access to education and employment through the overall empowerment of forest-dwelling communities, the explicit mention of habitat rights in the act makes it the most accurate answer.  The right to participate in local governance is not directly mentioned in the FRA.  Therefore, the habitat right is the only one explicitly guaranteed under the FRA for PVTGs.


**4.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion used by the Indian government to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Forest-based livelihoods
(b) Pre-agricultural level of existence
(c) High literacy rates
(d) A subsistence economy

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian government uses several criteria to identify PVTGs, focusing on their vulnerability and socio-economic backwardness.  These criteria include forest-based livelihoods, pre-agricultural level of existence, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy rates, and a subsistence economy.  High literacy rates are directly contradictory to the vulnerability and backwardness that define PVTGs.  The other options accurately reflect the established criteria for identifying these groups.  The absence of high literacy rates is a key characteristic that distinguishes PVTGs from other tribal groups.


**5.  The Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others Supreme Court case primarily addressed which of the following issues?**

(a) The rights of nomadic tribes to access forest resources.
(b) The constitutional validity of the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871.
(c) Caste-based discrimination against Denotified Tribes (DNTs) within prisons.
(d) The allocation of land rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sukanya Santha case specifically challenged the constitutionality of caste-based discrimination within prison systems against Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and "habitual offenders."  The court's judgment highlighted persistent caste-based discrimination in areas such as segregation of barracks, division of manual labor, and discriminatory provisions.  While the case indirectly touches upon the broader issues of DNT rights and the legacy of the Criminal Tribes Act, its central focus was on the unconstitutional nature of caste-based discrimination within prisons, violating Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23 of the Constitution.  The other options, while relevant to tribal rights, were not the primary focus of this landmark case.


**6.  Which of the following communities is NOT explicitly mentioned in the provided text as having been granted habitat rights under the FRA?**

(a) Paudi Bhuyans of Deogarh (Odisha)
(b) Maria Gond (Maharashtra)

(d)  Bharias (Madhya Pradesh)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text specifically mentions the Paudi Bhuyans, Saora tribals, Juangs, Chuktia Bhunjia, Hill Khadia, Dongria Kondhs, Mankidia tribe, Bharias, Kamars, Baigas, and Maria Gond as communities granted habitat rights or otherwise discussed in relation to habitat rights and PVTG status. The Chenchus are not explicitly mentioned in this context within the provided text. While Chenchus are a tribal group and may be eligible for habitat rights under the FRA, the text does not explicitly state that they have been granted such rights.  The question focuses on which community is *not* explicitly mentioned in the given text regarding habitat rights.


**7.  The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme is primarily funded through which mechanism?**

(a)  State-level budgets allocated specifically for PVTG development
(b)  International aid and grants from multilateral organizations
(c)  100% Central assistance in the form of grants-in-aid and creation of capital assets
(d)  Private sector investment and corporate social responsibility initiatives

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with 100% funding provided by the central government. This funding comes in the form of grants-in-aid and the creation of capital assets.  This ensures consistent and dedicated funding for the scheme's implementation across various states and union territories.  While state-level budgets and other sources may supplement the central funding, the primary and guaranteed source of funding is the 100% central assistance.  The scheme’s design intends to ensure consistent implementation, regardless of variations in state-level funding priorities.

(a)  Production and primary processing stages
(b)  Wholesale and distribution networks
(c)  Retail and consumer levels (household and food service)
(d)  International trade and export channels

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FWI Report 2024 specifically tracks global and national food waste generation at the retail and consumer levels, encompassing both household and food service sectors.  While food waste occurs throughout the supply chain, the FWI focuses on the final stages where consumers make choices that contribute significantly to overall waste.  The report’s focus on retail and consumer levels reflects the significant contribution of these sectors to global food waste and its environmental impact.  The other options represent other stages of the food system where waste also occurs but are not the primary focus of the FWI.


**10. The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) draws inspiration from which prior initiative?**

(a)  National Health Mission
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana
(c) Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN)
(d)  Ayushman Bharat

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PM-JUGA explicitly mentions its foundation on the learnings and success of the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN).  PM-JANMAN served as a pilot or precursor program, providing valuable insights and strategies that informed the design and implementation of PM-JUGA.  The other options, while important government schemes, are not directly linked to the conceptual origins of PM-JUGA. The question tests the understanding of the lineage and development of government programs.

These agencies collectively possess the expertise and global reach to assess and report on the complex issue of food security and nutrition worldwide.  The World Bank and IMF, while involved in global economic development, do not have the same direct mandate in food security and nutrition as the UN agencies. The Global Food Security Index is a ranking, not a report-producing organization.


**2. The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) aims to achieve which of the following primary objectives?**

(a) To solely focus on providing emergency food aid during crises.
(b) To improve humanitarian responses and reduce acute food insecurity by integrating existing initiatives.
(c) To exclusively concentrate on funding agricultural research and development.
(d) To act as a regulatory body overseeing international food trade policies.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The GNAFC's core mission is to create a more coordinated and effective approach to addressing food crises. This involves bringing together governments, international organizations, and NGOs to improve humanitarian responses and reduce the number of people facing acute food insecurity.  The GNAFC focuses on addressing the root causes of these crises, rather than simply providing immediate aid.  It does not solely focus on emergency aid, agricultural research, or trade regulation.


**3.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024, launched by UNEP and WRAP, primarily tracks which aspect of food waste?**

(a) Food waste generated during agricultural production and post-harvest processes.
(b) Food waste exclusively at the manufacturing and processing levels.
(c) Food waste generated at retail and consumer (household and food service) levels.
(d) Food waste solely from international trade and transportation.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Food Waste Index Report 2024 specifically focuses on measuring food waste at the retail and consumer levels. This includes waste generated in households, restaurants, and other food service establishments, as well as at retail stores.  While food loss during production and post-harvest is a significant issue, it's not the primary focus of this particular report.  The report aims to quantify the scale of waste at the point where consumers make choices and businesses manage inventory and sales.


**4. Which initiative aims to simplify licensing and registration processes for food businesses through a pan-India IT platform?**

(a)  The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment.
(b)  The Spot Food License Initiative.
(c)  The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) initiative.
(d)  The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY).

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Spot Food License Initiative utilizes the Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS) to streamline the licensing and registration process for food businesses across India. This initiative aims to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and promote ease of doing business in the food sector. The NQAS Assessment focuses on healthcare facilities. GAIN focuses on nutrition. PMGKAY deals with food grain distribution.


**5. The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) report, "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains," primarily promotes what type of investment?**

(a) Investments in infrastructure for food processing only.

**Explanation:** GAIN's report specifically advocates for investments that strengthen nutritious foods value chains.  The report highlights the potential of such investments to not only improve nutrition but also to reduce gender inequalities, boost productivity, and enhance the resilience of businesses involved in the food system. The report doesn't limit itself to infrastructure, GMOs, or international aid.


**6. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024, released by the World Economic Forum (WEF), uses which index to benchmark gender parity?**

(a) Gender Inequality Index (GII)
(b) Human Development Index (HDI)
(c) Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)
(d) Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The WEF's Global Gender Gap Report uses the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) as its primary metric.  The GGGI benchmarks gender parity across four key dimensions: health and survival, educational attainment, economic participation and opportunity, and political empowerment.  The GII is produced by UNDP, the HDI by UNDP, and MPI is also by UNDP. These other indices, while relevant to broader development issues, do not specifically focus on gender parity in the same way as the GGGI.


**7. According to the 2022 Gender Inequality Index (GII), released by the UNDP, which three countries ranked highest?**

(a)  United States, Canada, and Australia
(b)  China, India, and Brazil
(c)  Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland

(d)  India

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  WADA's 2022 data indicated that India recorded the highest percentage (3.26%) of doping offenders among the countries analyzed.  This highlights a significant challenge in maintaining the integrity of sports competitions in India and requires focused efforts on anti-doping measures.  The other countries mentioned have also faced doping issues, but not at the same reported percentage as India in 2022.


**12.  The Asmita Project, launched by the Union Ministry of Education, primarily aims to achieve which objective?**

(a) To promote digital literacy among students.
(b) To provide high-quality study materials in Indian languages.
(c) To improve teacher training programs.
(d) To enhance vocational training opportunities.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the Global Gender Gap Report, published annually by the World Economic Forum (WEF).  The report uses a Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) to measure gender parity across four key dimensions: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. Option (a) is incorrect because the UNDP publishes the Gender Inequality Index (GII), a different metric focusing on reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity. Option (c) is incorrect; the FAO publishes the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, which focuses on hunger and malnutrition. Option (d) is incorrect; the WHO is associated with the International Health Regulations (IHR), a framework for handling public health emergencies, not gender equality.  The question's difficulty lies in distinguishing between similar-sounding reports from different international organizations, requiring specific knowledge of each report's focus and publisher.


**2.  A report tracks global and national food waste generation at the retail and consumer levels, supporting two indicators of SDG 12.3. Which organization is the custodian of this report's data, and what is the report's name?**

(a) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); Food Loss Index (FLI)
(b) United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); Food Waste Index Report
(c) World Food Programme (WFP); Global Report on Food Crises
(d) World Health Organization (WHO); State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The correct answer is (b) because the Food Waste Index Report (FWI), which tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels, is produced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP.  It contributes to SDG 12.3.1 (b), aiming to halve per capita global food waste. Option (a) is incorrect as the FAO is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), which focuses on food losses along production and supply chains. Option (c) is incorrect; the WFP contributes to the Global Report on Food Crises, focusing on acute food insecurity, not food waste at the retail and consumer levels. Option (d) is incorrect; the WHO's report focuses on overall food security and nutrition, not specifically on food waste quantification. The difficulty lies in differentiating between various UN reports related to food security and distinguishing their custodians.


**3.  The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) released a report annually produced by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). What is the name of this report?**

(a) Food Waste Index Report
(b) State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report
(c) Global Report on Food Crises
(d) The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) publishes the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) annually, produced by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN).  This report focuses on the causes and consequences of acute food insecurity globally.  Option (a) is incorrect; the Food Waste Index Report is a separate report focused on food waste. Option (b) is incorrect; the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report has a broader scope than just acute food crises. Option (d) is incorrect; this is a report by GAIN, not GNAFC. This question tests knowledge of specific organizations and their publications within the food security domain, requiring recall of precise report titles.

(c) Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(d)  PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana (PMSGMBY)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment is the initiative launched by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  It assesses Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) using the digital IPHS platform for real-time monitoring. Option (a) is incorrect; this is a separate initiative focusing on food licensing. Option (c) is incorrect; this is a socio-economic development scheme for tribal communities. Option (d) is incorrect; this is a solar energy program. This question tests knowledge of specific Indian government initiatives in the healthcare sector and their associated monitoring mechanisms.

(b) National Curriculum Framework for Foundational Stage (NCF-FS) 2022
(c) Navchetana - National Framework for Early Childhood Stimulation (ECS)
(d) Adharshila


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Navchetana framework, released by MoWCD, specifically targets early childhood stimulation (ECS) for children aged 0-3 years. It emphasizes responsive caregiving and early learning. Options (a) and (b) are broader policy frameworks related to early childhood care and education but do not have the specific focus on stimulation in the 0-3 age group. Option (d) is a curriculum based on the Panchakosha concept and is not solely focused on early stimulation. This question tests knowledge of specific Indian government initiatives concerning early childhood development, requiring recall of a specific framework's name and focus.

(a) ASMITA Project
(b) Project NAMAN
(c) Bahubhasha Shabdkosh
(d) Real-time Translation Architecture


**Correct Answer:** (b)

(a) It solely focuses on providing financial aid to tribal households.
(b) It is entirely funded through newly allocated government budgets.
(c) It employs a convergence approach, integrating various existing schemes.
(d)  It primarily targets urban tribal populations.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description clearly points to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), which explicitly uses a convergence model, integrating resources and efforts from multiple existing schemes to address the multifaceted needs of tribal communities. Option (a) is incorrect as the scheme's scope is broader than just financial aid. Option (b) is wrong because the initiative leverages existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants. Option (d) is incorrect as PM-JUGA focuses on tribal villages.


**2.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) champions the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for individuals with various impairments.  Which of the following is NOT a core principle enshrined within the UN-CRPD?**

(b) To increase the GER for ST students to national levels.
(c) To make quality education affordable and accessible to ST students.
(d) To provide training and entrepreneurship promotion for ST individuals.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** While the initiative under PM-JUGA aims for holistic development, including health, the primary focus of the education-related goals is on improving education access and quality.  Option (a) relates to a separate health-focused goal within the larger PM-JUGA program but is not a direct goal of the education-focused component. Options (b), (c), and (d) are all direct goals concerning education and economic empowerment of ST students.

(c) Its primary focus is on projects within developed countries.
(d) It was established to promote financial inclusion in developing economies.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct.  The initial subscribed capital of the New Development Bank (NDB) was indeed $50 billion, with equal contributions from its founding BRICS members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).  However, the NDB's membership is not limited to BRICS nations; it has expanded to include other member countries.  Furthermore, its primary focus is on infrastructure and sustainable development projects in emerging economies and developing countries, not developed nations. Option (d) is partially correct in that the NDB aims to supplement existing financial institutions and support development, but its broader mandate is not solely focused on financial inclusion.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The IPEF is structured around four pillars: Trade, Supply Chain Resilience, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy.  Australia and New Zealand are members of the IPEF, making option (b) incorrect. The IPEF is not solely focused on bilateral trade agreements; it aims for broader regional economic cooperation.  It's also crucial to note that the IPEF is not a legally binding agreement like a traditional trade deal; instead, it relies on commitments and voluntary cooperation among member states, making option (d) incorrect.


3. **Which organizations jointly launched the International Advisory Body for Submarine Cable Resilience?**

(a) The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC).
(b) The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

(d) The UNCCD focuses solely on arid and semi-arid regions, excluding other forms of land degradation.

**Correct Answer:** (a) and (b)

**Explanation:**

Options (a) and (b) are correct. The UNCCD was adopted in 1994, and it is indeed the sole legally binding international agreement addressing desertification.  The convention's primary objective is to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought, ultimately aiming for land degradation neutrality by 2030. While India has been actively involved in the UNCCD, the provided text doesn't specify if it hosted the 14th COP session.  The UNCCD's scope encompasses various forms of land degradation beyond just arid and semi-arid areas.


5. **Which statement about the African Union (AU) is incorrect?**

Option (d) is incorrect. The African Union (AU) does indeed have 55 member states, but this number includes all independent states in Africa.  The other options correctly describe the AU's history, location, and objectives.  The AU plays a crucial role in promoting peace and security on the African continent through various initiatives and interventions.

(b) Its headquarters are in Vienna, Austria.
(c) NATO's primary focus is on economic cooperation among member states.
(d) NATO's membership is limited to European nations.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct.  NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), created in 1949, is founded on the principle of collective defense, meaning an attack on one member is considered an attack on all.  Its headquarters are in Brussels, Belgium, not Vienna, Austria.  NATO's main focus is on military security and defense, not economic cooperation.  Finally, NATO's membership includes North American and European countries.




**UPSC-Style MCQs on Science and Technology (Target Content):**

1. **Which organization adopted the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport?**

(a) World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)
(b) International Olympic Committee (IOC)
(c) United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
(d)  Council of Europe

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport was indeed adopted by UNESCO in Paris, France in 2005.  While WADA plays a crucial role in anti-doping efforts, it did not adopt the convention.  The IOC also combats doping, but the convention itself originated from UNESCO. The Council of Europe has also contributed to anti-doping efforts, but the convention is a UNESCO initiative.


2. **What is the primary aim of the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport?**

(a) To establish a global anti-doping agency
(b) To promote research into performance-enhancing drugs
(c) To harmonize anti-doping legislation and rules internationally

**Explanation:**

The core purpose of the UNESCO convention is to create a level playing field by unifying anti-doping laws, rules, and regulations globally.  While it influences the creation of anti-doping agencies and research, its main focus is harmonization.  The convention doesn't dictate specific banned substances but provides a framework for nations to define their own banned lists within a common framework.

(a)  Bahubhasha Shabdkosh
(b)  Real-time Translation Architecture
(c)  ASMITA Project
(d)  Project NAMAN

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ASMITA (Augmenting Study Materials in Indian languages through Translation and Academic writing) Project directly addresses the goal of providing high-quality educational materials in multiple Indian languages. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh and Real-time Translation Architecture are supporting initiatives but don't focus on producing the materials themselves. Project NAMAN serves a completely different purpose related to defense pensioners.

(b) Integrating sports with economic development strategies.
(c) Emphasizing indigenous games and promoting inclusivity in sports.
(d)  Establishing a national fitness ranking system exclusively for professional athletes.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the NSP 2024 aims to establish a National Fitness Ranking & Indexing system, it's not limited to professional athletes. The policy envisions broader participation and fitness improvement across the population, not just elite athletes.  The other options are all key components of the draft policy, addressing excellence, economic benefits, and social inclusion in sports.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

RPL's core function is to formally acknowledge and credit knowledge, skills, and experience gained through various learning pathways (formal, non-formal, informal), integrating them into the formal higher education framework.  It's not about faculty research evaluation, teaching quality assessment, or institutional ranking based on research.


7.  **According to the National Health Accounts estimates, which entity is responsible for preparing these estimates?**

(a) The World Health Organization (WHO)
(b) The National Institute of Health (NIH)
(c) The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS)
(d) The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) is specifically mentioned as the body responsible for preparing the National Health Accounts estimates in India, guided by a steering committee and expert group.  The WHO, NIH, and ICMR are involved in various aspects of health research and policy, but the preparation of these specific accounts is done by NHATS.


8.  **What is the primary aim of the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)?**

(a) To regulate the pharmaceutical industry in India.
(b) To fund research in space exploration.
(c) To foster a culture of research and innovation across India.
(d) To manage educational institutions in India.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ANRF is explicitly established to promote research and innovation throughout India, aligning with the National Education Policy's recommendations. It doesn't directly regulate pharmaceuticals, focus solely on space exploration, or manage educational institutions.  While it may indirectly support these areas through funded research, its primary mandate is broader research and innovation cultivation.




**1.  A global ranking system evaluates universities based on nine performance indicators and places IIT Bombay as the highest-ranked Indian institution. Which organization publishes this ranking?**

(a) Times Higher Education (THE)
(b) National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
(c) Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)
(d)  University Grants Commission (UGC)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the QS World University Rankings, which is explicitly mentioned in the provided text as using nine performance indicators and ranking IIT Bombay among Indian institutions.  Times Higher Education (THE) also publishes university rankings, but the text specifies that QS is the source for this particular ranking system. NIRF is an Indian ranking framework, not a global one.  The UGC is a regulatory body and does not directly publish global university rankings. Therefore, Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) is the correct answer.  The use of nine performance indicators is a crucial detail that distinguishes this ranking system from others.  Understanding the different ranking organizations and their methodologies is vital for comprehending the global higher education landscape and its impact on India.


**2.  The Union Government granted permission for a UK university to establish a campus in Gurugram, India, under specific regulations. What is the name of these regulations?**

(a) National Education Policy 2020 Regulations
(b)  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023
(c)  Foreign University Campus Establishment Act, 2023
(d)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) Regulations

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that the University of Southampton's campus in Gurugram is the first international university to set up a campus in India under the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023.  The National Education Policy 2020 provided the vision for allowing foreign universities to set up campuses, but it is not the specific regulatory framework.  There is no mention of a "Foreign University Campus Establishment Act, 2023" in the text.  NIRF is a ranking framework, unrelated to the establishment of foreign university campuses. The detailed description of the regulations in the provided text makes it clear that (b) is the correct and precise answer.  Understanding the regulatory framework governing foreign universities in India is critical for analyzing the implications of international collaboration in higher education.



**3. An amendment to an international health regulation, defining a pandemic emergency based on geographical spread and national health system capacity, was recently agreed upon.  Which global health body's meeting produced this agreement?**

(a)  The International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC)
(b)  The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty
(c)  The 77th annual World Health Assembly (WHA)
(d) The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions that the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, including the definition of a pandemic emergency, were agreed upon at the 77th annual World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting.  The ICPC is focused on submarine cables, not public health. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty addresses a different issue.  NHATS is involved in compiling health accounts, not international regulations.  The specific reference to the 77th WHA meeting and the amendments concerning pandemic emergencies makes (c) the definitive answer.  Knowledge of the WHO's role in global health governance and the mechanisms for amending international health regulations is crucial for understanding public health preparedness and response.


**4.  A new national research foundation in India aims to foster research and innovation, mobilizing significant funding. Which organization is responsible for the administration of this foundation?**

(a)  The Ministry of Education
(b) The National Board of Accreditation (NBA)
(c) The INFLIBNET Centre
(d) The Department of Science and Technology (DST)

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text states that the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) is administered by the Department of Science and Technology (DST). While the Ministry of Education plays a role in overall education policy, the ANRF's administrative responsibilities are explicitly assigned to the DST.  The NBA and INFLIBNET are involved in accreditation and information technology, respectively, but not the administration of ANRF. The text clearly identifies the DST as the administrative department, making (d) the unequivocal correct answer. Understanding the organizational structure of Indian science and technology policy is key to analyzing the country's research and development efforts.


**5.  A Swiss-based NGO works to combat malnutrition through public-private partnerships. What is the name of this organization?**

(a)  UNICEF
(b)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(c) GAIN
(d)  FAO

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly describes GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) as a Swiss-based NGO focused on tackling malnutrition through public-private partnerships.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the subject matter.

**1.  Concerning the financial resources directed towards combating hunger and malnutrition, which of the following accurately reflects the scope of the "financing for food security and nutrition" definition as presented in a recent report?**

(a) It solely encompasses government-allocated budgets for food subsidies and welfare programs.
(b) It exclusively focuses on international aid and donor funding for agricultural development.
(c) It comprehensively includes both public and private financial resources, domestic and foreign, aimed at eradicating hunger and malnutrition in all its forms, encompassing aspects like food availability, access, utilization, and stability, and strengthening agrifood systems resilience.
(d) It narrowly concentrates on private sector investments in food processing and distribution networks.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the definition explicitly states that "financing for food security and nutrition" encompasses a broad spectrum of financial resources.  It's not limited to government spending (a) or solely international aid (b). It transcends the narrow focus on private sector investment (d) by including both public and private resources, both domestic and foreign. The definition's key strength lies in its holistic approach, considering all aspects of food security and nutrition – availability, access, utilization, stability, and the crucial element of resilient agrifood systems.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent oversimplifications or partial interpretations of the definition, failing to capture its comprehensive nature.  A thorough understanding of food security necessitates recognizing the multifaceted nature of its financing, which option (c) accurately reflects.


**2.  The Global Gender Gap Report 2024, released by the World Economic Forum (WEF), highlights several key findings. Which of the following statements accurately reflects a significant aspect of its assessment of global gender parity?**

(a)  Complete gender parity is projected to be achieved within the next 25 years.
(b) The report indicates that the gender gap in political empowerment has widened significantly in 2024 compared to 2023.
(c)  The report shows that while substantial progress has been made, a significant gender gap persists, and achieving full parity will take considerably longer than a century at the current pace of progress.
(d)  The report reveals that India has achieved near-parity in economic participation and opportunity for women.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the report explicitly mentions that while progress has been made (68.5% of the global gender gap has been closed), achieving full gender parity is projected to take 134 years at the current rate. Option (a) is incorrect as it contradicts the report's timeframe. Option (b) is incorrect as the report indicates a small decline in political empowerment in India, not a significant widening globally. Option (d) is also incorrect; the report shows India's ranking is relatively low, indicating a significant gender gap persists in economic participation.  The question tests the understanding of the report's overall assessment, emphasizing the persistent gender gap despite progress.  The lengthy timeframe for achieving full parity underscores the significant challenges that remain.


**3.  Regarding the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, adopted at the 77th World Health Assembly (WHA), which of the following is NOT a key feature of the changes?**

(a)  The establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism to assist developing countries.
(b)  A revised definition of a pandemic emergency, incorporating factors like geographical spread and national health system capacity.
(c) The creation of a global body to enforce IHR compliance through sanctions on non-compliant nations.
(d)  The establishment of National IHR Authorities to improve coordination within countries.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the amendments introduce mechanisms for improved coordination and financial support, they do not include a global body with enforcement powers to impose sanctions (option c).  The amendments focus on cooperation and capacity building, not punitive measures. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect key aspects of the amendments: establishing a financial mechanism, refining the pandemic definition, and creating national authorities for better coordination.  Understanding the nuances of international cooperation in public health is crucial here. Option (c) presents a plausible but incorrect distractor, highlighting the difference between collaborative efforts and coercive enforcement in the context of global health governance.


**4.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. Which of the following is NOT a key objective or feature of this scheme?**

(a)  Convergence of existing schemes to address critical gaps in social infrastructure.
(b)  Establishment of new, specialized institutions for skill development and vocational training exclusively for tribal youth.
(c)  Focus on improving healthcare access and addressing issues like Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).
(d)  Upgradation of infrastructure in government residential schools and hostels for tribal children.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While PM-JUGA aims to improve various aspects of tribal life, it does not focus on creating entirely new, separate institutions for skill development (b).  The scheme prioritizes the convergence and utilization of existing resources and programs. Options (a), (c), and (d) are core features of PM-JUGA: improving infrastructure, healthcare access (including initiatives for SCD), and leveraging existing schemes for a holistic approach.  Option (b) represents a plausible but incorrect addition, highlighting the difference between creating entirely new structures versus leveraging existing ones for efficiency. The question tests the understanding of the scheme's practical implementation and resource allocation strategies.


**5.  In the context of passive euthanasia, as per recent guidelines and judicial pronouncements, which of the following statements is INCORRECT?**

(a)  The Supreme Court has recognized the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right.
(b)  A Primary Medical Board (PMB) and a Secondary Medical Board (SMB) are involved in the process of assessing requests for withdrawal of life support.
(c)  Active euthanasia, where a medical professional directly administers a lethal substance, is legally permissible in India.
(d)  The guidelines emphasize the importance of obtaining informed consent before withdrawing life-sustaining treatment.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the focus is on passive euthanasia, which involves withdrawing life support, not active euthanasia (directly administering a lethal substance).  Options (a), (b), and (d) correctly reflect aspects of the legal framework and guidelines surrounding passive euthanasia: the Supreme Court's recognition of the right to die with dignity, the role of medical boards, and the importance of informed consent.  Option (c) presents a key distinction between the two types of euthanasia, testing the understanding of legal and ethical considerations in end-of-life care.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between legal and illegal practices within the context of palliative care.


**1.  Which organization is the custodian of the Food Waste Index (FWI), an indicator that tracks global food waste at retail and consumer levels, contributing to the achievement of SDG 12.3.1 (b)?**

(a) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(b) World Food Programme (WFP)
(c) United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(d) Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Food Waste Index Report 2024, launched by UNEP and WRAP, explicitly states that UNEP is the custodian of the FWI.  The FAO is responsible for the Food Loss Index (FLI), a related but distinct indicator focusing on food losses during production and supply chains.  The WFP is involved in addressing food crises and hunger, but not directly responsible for the FWI. WRAP collaborates with UNEP on the FWI report but is not the custodian.  Therefore, the accurate and precise answer is UNEP.  Understanding the roles of different UN agencies in sustainable development goals is crucial for UPSC preparation, demonstrating a grasp of international organizations and their mandates.


**2.  The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment initiative, launched by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, aims to improve the quality of which specific healthcare facilities in India?**

(a) Private hospitals and clinics
(b) Allopathic medical colleges

(d)  Rural primary health centers only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text clearly states that the NQAS Assessment is specifically designed for AAMs and IPHLs.  It emphasizes the initiative's compliance with Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) and its role in promoting "Healthcare for All."  Options (a) and (d) are incorrect because the passage focuses on public health facilities, not private ones or a specific subset of rural centers. Option (b) is also incorrect as the passage doesn't mention medical colleges.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of Indian healthcare initiatives.


**3.  What is the primary aim of the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)'s report, "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains"?**

(a) To promote organic farming practices globally.
(b) To advocate for increased nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to reduce gender inequalities, increase productivity, and enhance business resilience.
(c) To analyze the impact of climate change on global food security.
(d) To study the effectiveness of various food distribution programs in developing countries.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage directly outlines the report's objective: promoting nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to simultaneously address gender inequality, boost productivity, and strengthen the resilience of businesses within this sector. The other options are unrelated to the report's core focus.  This question assesses conceptual understanding of development-related reports and their aims.


**4. According to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, what is the global hunger level classification and the associated global GHI score?**

(a) Severe; GHI score of 25.0
(b) Moderate; GHI score of 18.3
(c) Alarming; GHI score of 30.0
(d)  Critical; GHI score of 22.5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that the world's GHI score is 18.3, categorized as "moderate" on the hunger severity scale.  While the report highlights alarming hunger levels in several countries, the overall global classification is moderate. The question tests factual recall of specific data from the GHI report.


**5.  Which Indian government scheme aims to provide free food grains to a large segment of the poor population?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana
(b) Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
(c) National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013
(d) Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly indicates that PMGKAY is designed to provide free food grains to 80 crore poor individuals.  While the other options address nutritional needs and food security, they do not primarily focus on the distribution of free food grains on the scale of PMGKAY. The question tests factual recall and understanding of Indian social welfare programs.


**6. What specific right does the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, legally recognize in India?**

(a) The right to education
(b) The right to shelter
(c) The right to healthcare
(d) The right to food


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the NFSA, 2013, recognizes the right to food as a statutory right. The other options are important rights but are not the focus of the NFSA. This question tests factual recall concerning the legal framework of food security in India.


**7.  In which two Indian states did the District Level Committee approve habitat rights for Juangs and Mankidia tribes, both categorized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh
(b) Odisha and Andhra Pradesh
(c) Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra
(d) Odisha and West Bengal


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The passage mentions that the habitat rights were approved for these tribes in Odisha.  The other options are incorrect as they are not mentioned in the provided context. This question tests factual recall of specific geographical locations related to tribal rights.

(a) Individuals convicted of white-collar crimes
(b)  Members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
(c) Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and "habitual offenders"
(d)  Foreign nationals imprisoned in India


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage specifically highlights the Supreme Court's action against caste-based discrimination in prisons affecting DNTs and "habitual offenders."  The other options are not the primary focus of this court case. The question tests understanding of judicial pronouncements related to social justice and the rights of marginalized communities.


**9.  What is the main focus of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024?**

(a) The impact of climate change on food production
(b) The role of technology in improving food security
(c) Financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition
(d) The effectiveness of international food aid programs


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The passage clearly states that the report's theme centers on financing as the key to eradicating hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition in all its forms.  While the other options are relevant to food security, they are not the central theme of this specific report. The question assesses understanding of international reports on food security and nutrition.


**10. Which three international organizations launched the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) in 2016?**

(a) World Bank, UNICEF, and WHO
(b) European Union, FAO, and WFP
(c)  IMF, UNDP, and UNHCR
(d)  G20, WTO, and OECD


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly names the European Union, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Food Programme (WFP) as the founding organizations of the GNAFC. The other options are incorrect. This question tests factual recall of international organizations and their collaborations in addressing global issues.



Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, designed to test various cognitive skills relevant to the UPSC exam.  Each question is followed by a detailed explanation.


**1.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) aims to cultivate a research-oriented society in India. Which of the following is NOT a key initiative undertaken by ANRF to achieve this goal?**

(a) Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(b) Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(c) ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)
(d)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is a separate initiative launched by the Ministry of Education in 2015, distinct from the ANRF. While both aim to improve India's higher education and research landscape,  NIRF focuses on ranking institutions based on established parameters, whereas ANRF focuses on fostering a research culture through funding, mentorship, and the creation of research centers.  PAIR, MAHA, and ACE are all directly under the ANRF's purview to boost research and innovation.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all core ANRF initiatives directly aimed at fostering research and innovation.  NIRF (d), while important for the overall higher education ecosystem, is not a direct ANRF initiative.


**2.  The University Grants Commission (UGC) recently issued a Letter of Intent (LoI) to a foreign university to establish a campus in India. This move aligns with which major policy document's vision?**

(a) The Dhebar Committee Report (1960-61)
(b) The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020
(c) The Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006
(d) The National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UGC's action directly implements the vision of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The NEP aims to enhance higher education in India by incorporating an international dimension. Allowing foreign universities to establish campuses is a key step toward achieving this goal.  The Dhebar Committee Report relates to tribal communities, the FRA concerns forest rights, and the NFSA addresses food security; none of these are directly related to the establishment of foreign university campuses in India.


**3.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects a criterion for a Foreign Higher Educational Institution (FHEI) to establish a campus in India under the UGC regulations of 2023?**

(a) The FHEI must have a specific focus on agricultural research.
(b) The FHEI must be ranked within the top 100 globally in at least one subject area.
(c) The FHEI must be ranked in the global top 500, either overall or in relevant subject areas, or possess exceptional expertise in a specific field.
(d) The FHEI must demonstrate a commitment to solely providing online education.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UGC regulations of 2023 clearly specify that FHEIs must meet specific ranking criteria or demonstrate exceptional expertise to establish campuses in India.  The regulation states that they must be ranked within the global top 500, either overall or in relevant subject areas, or possess outstanding expertise in a particular area.  Options (a) and (d) are too restrictive, while (b) is less inclusive than the actual criteria.


**4.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 highlights a connection between several factors and the prevalence of hunger.  Which of the following is NOT explicitly mentioned as a contributing factor in the GHI report?**

(a) Gender inequality
(b) Climate change
(c)  Lack of access to clean drinking water
(d) Maternal malnutrition


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While access to clean water is undeniably crucial for overall health and well-being, and indirectly impacts nutrition, the GHI report explicitly links hunger to gender inequality, climate change, and maternal malnutrition. The report emphasizes how these factors exacerbate food insecurity and malnutrition, creating a cycle of poverty and hunger.  The report does not directly address lack of access to clean drinking water as a primary driver of hunger, although it is undoubtedly a related issue.


**5.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Which of the following is NOT a key focus area of this scheme?**

(a) Upgrading infrastructure in government residential schools/hostels.
(b) Promoting Tribal Home Stays to leverage tourism potential.
(c) Establishing new agricultural universities focused on tribal crops.
(d)  Improving access to healthcare facilities for Scheduled Tribes.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA focuses on improving existing social infrastructure, healthcare, education, and livelihood opportunities for tribal communities. The scheme leverages existing schemes and resources to achieve its goals. While improving agriculture is a component,  the scheme does not focus on establishing entirely new agricultural universities.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all key areas addressed by PM-JUGA.


**6.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). Which state has the highest number of recognized PVTGs according to the provided text?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Maharashtra
(d) Odisha


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that Odisha has 13 recognized PVTGs, the highest among all states and Union Territories.  While other states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra also have PVTGs, Odisha has the largest number according to the information provided.


**7.  The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2025 employs how many indicators to assess universities?**

(a) 5
(b) 9
(c) 18
(d) 25


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that THE World University Rankings 2025 uses 18 indicators across five key areas to assess universities.  The other options are incorrect.


**8.  Which organization published the University Impact Rankings 2024, which assesses universities based on their contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?**

(a) Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)
(b) Times Higher Education (THE)
(c) National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
(d)  University Grants Commission (UGC)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that Times Higher Education (THE) published the University Impact Rankings 2024.  The other options are involved in different ranking systems.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  Each question is designed to be challenging and avoids obvious or trivial answers.


**1.  A significant international convention focusing on the rights and well-being of a specific group of individuals was adopted in New York in 2006 and came into force two years later.  Which convention is being described, and what is its primary objective?**

(a) The Biwako Millennium Framework, aiming for universal healthcare access.
(b) The Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region, promoting regional cooperation.
(c) The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), promoting full and equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities.
(d) The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), aiming to conserve biological diversity.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question clearly points to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD).  Option (a) is incorrect as it refers to a framework, not a convention, and its focus is broader than just healthcare. Option (b) is a related declaration but not the primary convention described. Option (d) is a different convention entirely, focusing on biodiversity. The UN-CRPD's primary objective is explicitly stated in the provided text, aligning perfectly with the description in the question. The question tests factual recall regarding the convention's adoption, entry into force, and core aim, demanding precise knowledge of international human rights instruments.


**2.  A government initiative, named after a prominent tribal leader known for resisting British rule, aims to improve socio-economic conditions in tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in various sectors.  Which scheme is this, and what is its primary funding source?**

(a) PM-JANMAN, funded through a dedicated national fund for tribal welfare.
(b) Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), funded from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.
(c)  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, funded entirely by international aid organizations.
(d)  National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM), funded through a mix of central and state government budgets.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question describes the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) scheme. Option (a) is incorrect because, while PM-JANMAN is mentioned as a source of learning for PM-JUGA, it is not the scheme being described.  Option (c) describes a different, albeit related, scheme. Option (d) is yet another unrelated scheme. The question tests knowledge of specific government schemes and their funding mechanisms, requiring the candidate to differentiate between similar-sounding initiatives. The accurate identification of the funding source – existing DAPST grants – demonstrates a deeper understanding of the scheme's implementation.



**3.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006 grants specific rights to particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs). What specific right is granted under Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA, and which state has the highest number of recognized PVTGs?**

(a)  Grazing rights, Odisha.
(b)  Habitat rights, Odisha.
(c)  Land ownership rights, Madhya Pradesh.
(d)  Religious freedom rights, Chhattisgarh.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on habitat rights granted to PVTGs under the FRA.  Option (a) is partially correct in naming Odisha but misses the crucial aspect of habitat rights. Options (c) and (d) are incorrect as they relate to different rights and states.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the FRA and its specific provisions relating to PVTGs.  Knowing that Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the distribution and vulnerability of these groups across India.  The correct answer requires specific knowledge of the legal framework concerning tribal rights.


**4.  A Swiss-based NGO, established at the UN in 2002, focuses on addressing malnutrition through public-private partnerships. Which organization is this, and where is its headquarters located?**

(a)  UNICEF, New York.
(b)  World Food Programme (WFP), Rome.
(c)  GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition), Geneva.
(d)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Rome.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** This question centers on GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition). Options (a), (b), and (d) are all prominent international organizations dealing with food security and related issues but are not the organization described.  The question tests knowledge of international NGOs and their specific mandates.  Knowing the organization's location and its focus on public-private partnerships demonstrates an understanding of its operational model and the broader context of global nutrition initiatives.


**5.  The 2022 testing figures released by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed a concerning statistic regarding doping violations in a particular country. Which country had the highest percentage of doping offenders in 2022, and what international convention aims to combat doping in sports?**

(b)  India, the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport.
(c)  Russia, the WADA's World Anti-Doping Code.
(d)  United States, the IOC's Olympic Charter.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question directly asks about India’s high doping rate in 2022 and the relevant international convention.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either misidentify the country or the international instrument. The correct answer requires specific knowledge of recent anti-doping statistics and the legal framework governing the fight against doping in international sports.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of global sports governance.


**6. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is a significant initiative in India's higher education sector.  Which ministry launched NIRF, and what is its primary objective?**

(a) Ministry of Human Resource Development (now Ministry of Education), to promote private universities.
(b) Ministry of Science and Technology, to rank research institutions.
(c) Ministry of Education, to rank educational institutions across the country based on set parameters.
(d) University Grants Commission (UGC), to improve university teaching standards.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

The correct answer requires knowledge of Indian higher education policy and the role of NIRF in evaluating institutions.  It tests factual recall about the ministry and the framework's core goal.


**7.  Amendments to a crucial international health regulation were agreed upon at a recent World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting. Which regulations were amended, and what was a key reason for these amendments?**

(a)  The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), due to increasing global inequality.
(b)  The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, due to experiences with epidemics and pandemics like Ebola and COVID-19.
(c)  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), due to human rights violations during conflicts.
(d)  The Geneva Conventions, due to concerns about the treatment of prisoners of war.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question points to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they refer to different international legal frameworks.  The question tests knowledge of global health governance and the reasons behind the recent amendments to the IHR. The accurate identification of the reason – experiences with major epidemics and pandemics – demonstrates an understanding of the evolving challenges in global health security.


**8. A project launched by the Indian Army aims to provide comprehensive support to a specific group of individuals through Common Service Centres (CSCs). What is the name of this project, and which group does it primarily serve?**

(a) Project Shakti, serving women veterans.
(b) Project Samarth, serving disabled veterans.
(c) Project NAMAN, serving Defence Pensioners, Veterans and their families.
(d) Project Rakshak, serving active-duty soldiers.

The correct answer demonstrates knowledge of Indian defence policies and initiatives aimed at supporting veterans and their families. The question tests factual recall about a specific military project and its intended beneficiaries.


**1.  A report focusing on financial mechanisms to combat global hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition in its various forms was recently published. Which organization is responsible for this report?**

(a) The World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c)  The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
(d)  A collaborative effort by five UN agencies, including FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because the provided text explicitly states that the "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024" was a joint publication of five UN specialized agencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the World Health Organization (WHO). While the FAO and WFP are individually involved in food security and nutrition, the report's creation was a collaborative effort encompassing a broader range of UN expertise.  Options (a), (b), and (c) represent individual organizations that contribute to addressing global hunger but don't accurately reflect the collaborative nature of the specific report in question. The GNAFC plays a coordinating role in addressing food crises but is not the sole author of this specific report on financing for food security and nutrition.  Understanding the collaborative nature of international initiatives to address global challenges is crucial for comprehending the complex interplay between various organizations and their mandates.


**2.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, which revealed alarming hunger levels in numerous countries, was jointly released by which two non-governmental organizations?**

(a) Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
(b)  Oxfam and Action Against Hunger
(c)  World Vision and CARE International
(d)  Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly identifies Concern Worldwide (Ireland) and Welthungerhilfe (Germany) as the joint publishers of the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024.  The other options present other reputable NGOs working in the field of hunger relief but are not the specific organizations responsible for releasing the GHI 2024.  Knowing the source of such indices is important for understanding their methodology and potential biases.  The GHI is a widely followed metric, and understanding its authorship is crucial for interpreting its findings and implications for policy.  Incorrect options represent organizations with related mandates but are not the specific authors of the 2024 GHI report.


**3.  Which initiative, launched by the Indian government, provides free food grains to a significant portion of its impoverished population?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)
(b)  National Food Security Act (NFSA)
(c)  Poshan Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission)
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) is explicitly mentioned in the text as a program providing free food grains to 80 crore (800 million) poor people in India.  While the NFSA establishes the right to food, it doesn't directly provide free grains to the extent of PMGKAY.  Poshan Abhiyan focuses on nutrition, and PMMVY provides support to mothers, but neither is primarily focused on the distribution of free food grains on the scale of PMGKAY.  Understanding India's various food security programs and their respective roles is essential for analyzing its approach to tackling hunger and malnutrition.  The other options are relevant to food security and nutrition in India but don't directly address the provision of free food grains on the scale indicated.


**4.  The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024, which tracks global food waste at retail and consumer levels, is a collaborative effort between which two organizations?**

(a) The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme)
(b)  The FAO and the World Bank
(c)  The World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation
(d)  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the UNHRC


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme) jointly launched the Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024.  The other options list organizations involved in various aspects of food security and sustainability, but they are not the specific partners responsible for the FWI Report.  Understanding the roles of different organizations in monitoring and addressing global food waste is crucial for effective policy formulation and implementation.  The incorrect options represent other organizations that contribute to various aspects of food security and environmental sustainability but are not directly involved in the FWI report.


**5. A report titled ‘The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains: An Opportunity for Gender Impact’ promoting nutrition investments in the agri-food sector was recently released by which organization?**

(a) The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(b)  The World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC)
(c)  The UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
(d)  The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions that the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) released the report "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains: An Opportunity for Gender Impact."  While the other organizations listed are also involved in improving nutrition and food security, they are not identified as the authors of this specific report.  This question tests the ability to link specific reports to their publishing organizations, a skill useful for analyzing global development initiatives. The incorrect options feature organizations that address related issues, but the provided text clearly attributes this report to GAIN.


**1.  A report focusing on financial resources dedicated to eradicating hunger and malnutrition, emphasizing the availability, access, utilization, and stability of nutritious food, and strengthening agrifood systems resilience, is associated with which of the following?**

(a)  The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) report on food crises
(b) The Food Waste Index Report 2024
(c) The Global Gender Gap Report 2024
(d) The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, directly addresses the theme of financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.  Its definition of financing encompasses both public and private resources, domestic and foreign, aiming to improve the availability, access, utilization, and stability of safe and nutritious food. The report also highlights the importance of resilient agrifood systems.  Option (a) focuses on food crises, (b) on food waste, and (c) on gender inequality, none of which are the central themes of the report described in the question.  The question's description precisely matches the report's core focus, making (d) the only correct answer.  The other options deal with related but distinct aspects of food security and nutrition.


**2. Which organization is responsible for producing the annual Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)?**

(a) The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(b) The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(c) The Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
(d) The World Economic Forum (WEF)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is explicitly stated to be produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN).  The other options are involved in related areas of food security and nutrition but are not the direct producers of the GRFC. UNEP focuses on environmental issues, GAIN on nutrition, and the WEF on global economic matters. The question specifically asks for the producing organization of the GRFC, making (c) the only accurate and precise response.  The other options represent organizations that contribute to or are involved in efforts related to global food security, but they do not directly produce the GRFC.


**3. The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report, which tracks global and national food waste at retail and consumer levels, and contributes to SDG 12.3 indicators, is a collaborative effort between which two organizations?**

(a) FAO and IFAD
(b)  UN Women and UNICEF
(c) UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP
(d) WHO and the World Bank


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that the Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024 is a joint initiative of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme). The other options are involved in global development and health but are not specifically connected to the FWI report.  The question accurately describes the FWI report's function and asks for the collaborating organizations responsible for its production. This specificity makes option (c) the only correct answer. The other options represent organizations that play roles in global food security and nutrition but are not the creators of the specific report in question.


**4.  A Swiss-based NGO established at the United Nations in 2002, dedicated to combating malnutrition by promoting public-private partnerships to improve access to essential nutrients, is identified as:**

(a)  The World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c) The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d) Concern Worldwide


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description perfectly matches the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN).  GAIN is explicitly identified as a Swiss-based NGO founded at the UN in 2002, focusing on malnutrition and using public-private partnerships to improve nutritional access. The other options, while involved in aspects of food security and nutrition, do not fit the description provided in the question. The question carefully describes GAIN's key features, including its location, founding date, and approach to tackling malnutrition. This level of detail makes option (c) the only accurate and unambiguous answer, eliminating any potential for confusion with other organizations that work in similar fields.


**5. The Global Hunger Index (GHI), released annually by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, assesses hunger levels globally and in specific countries, and highlights the correlation between factors like gender inequality and climate change with hunger.  Which of the following is NOT a key finding or area of focus of the GHI?**

(a)  Assessment of hunger severity using a scoring system
(b)  Analysis of the impact of gender inequality on food insecurity
(c)  Tracking of food waste at the retail and consumer levels
(d)  Examination of the link between climate change and hunger


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GHI focuses on assessing hunger levels, analyzing the impact of gender inequality and climate change on hunger.  Tracking food waste at retail and consumer levels is the domain of the Food Waste Index Report, not the GHI.  The question specifically identifies the GHI's key areas of focus and asks which element is NOT part of it. This direct comparison makes option (c) the only correct answer. The other options are directly related to the GHI's core assessment criteria and methodologies.   The inclusion of (c) as a distractor highlights the need for precise understanding of the different indices and their respective scopes.


**6. The organization that launched the “The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains: An Opportunity for Gender Impact” report, advocating for nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to reduce gender inequalities and enhance business resilience, is:**

(a) The World Economic Forum (WEF)
(b) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
(c) The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d) The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question directly points to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) as the organization behind the specified report.  GAIN's focus on nutrition and gender equality aligns precisely with the report's theme.  The other organizations, while involved in related areas, are not explicitly linked to this particular report.  The specificity of the question, mentioning the report's title and its core themes, makes the identification of GAIN as the launching organization unambiguous. The other options represent organizations that work on related issues, but not the precise organization responsible for the publication in question.  The question tests knowledge of specific organizations and their activities.


**7.  A legally binding framework defining countries' rights and obligations in managing public health emergencies that can cross borders, initially established in 1951 and later revised, is known as:**

(a) The Rome Declaration on Nutrition
(b) The International Health Regulations (IHR)
(c) The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
(d) The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The International Health Regulations (IHR) are explicitly described as a legally binding framework addressing cross-border public health emergencies.  The question highlights its evolution from an earlier version (1951) and its core function.  The other options represent significant initiatives related to global health and development but do not meet the description of a legally binding framework for managing cross-border public health crises. The question directly asks about the framework's legal nature and its function, making option (b) the only suitable answer. The other options represent different international agreements or initiatives that, while related to global health, do not fit the specific description of the IHR.


**8.  The body responsible for determining the policies of the World Health Organization (WHO), appointing its Director-General, and overseeing financial policies, is the:**

(a)  The WHO Executive Board
(b) The World Health Assembly (WHA)
(c) The WHO Regional Committees
(d) The UN General Assembly


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Assembly (WHA) is explicitly stated to be the decision-making body of the WHO, with the responsibilities of policy determination, appointing the Director-General, and overseeing financial matters. The other options are involved in WHO governance but do not hold the same level of authority and responsibility. The question directly asks for the WHO's primary decision-making body and its functions, making option (b) the only correct answer. The other options represent different levels of WHO governance, but they do not possess the full range of responsibilities outlined in the question.


**9.  The initiative aimed at eradicating hunger and poverty, reducing inequalities, and acting as a facilitator in building partnerships and mobilizing resources, launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024, is known as the:**

(a)  The Zero Hunger Challenge
(b) The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty
(c) The Rome Declaration on Nutrition
(d) The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty is explicitly described as the initiative launched at the G20 summit with the aims of eradicating hunger and poverty, reducing inequality, and facilitating partnerships and resource mobilization.  The other options represent related but distinct initiatives or frameworks.  The question highlights the initiative's goals and its launch context, making option (b) the only accurate identification. The other options represent different efforts toward achieving related goals, but they do not meet the specific description given in the question.  The question's phrasing tests the knowledge of specific global initiatives and their aims.


**10.  Which of the following reports ranks countries based on the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), using indicators across four key dimensions (Health and Survival, Educational Attainment, Economic Participation and Opportunity, and Political Empowerment)?**

(a)  The Gender Inequality Index (GII)
(b) The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report
(c) The Global Hunger Index (GHI)
(d) The Global Gender Gap Report


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Report is explicitly identified as the report that uses the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) for ranking countries based on the four specified dimensions. The other options focus on different aspects of development and inequality, not gender inequality as measured by the GGGI.  The question clearly asks for the report using the GGGI and its key features, thus making (d) the only correct answer. The other options, while relevant to global development issues, do not focus specifically on gender equality as measured by the GGGI.  The question tests knowledge of specific reports and their methodologies.


**1.  A governmental initiative aims to bolster the financial independence of women in rural India through the formation of self-governing groups and revolving funds.  Which initiative best aligns with this description?**

(a)  The Asmita Project
(b)  Project NAMAN
(c)  The Lakhpati Didi Initiative
(d)  The Play True Campaign

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Lakhpati Didi initiative, launched in 2023 under the Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), directly targets the financial empowerment of women in rural areas.  It focuses on enabling Self Help Groups (SHGs) to increase their income and achieve financial self-sufficiency.  The initiative provides financial assistance through revolving funds, capitalization support, and bank loans, aligning perfectly with the description.  The Asmita Project focuses on multilingual education, Project NAMAN supports defense pensioners, and the Play True Campaign combats doping in sports, making them irrelevant to the question's core theme of women's financial empowerment through SHGs.

(a)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(b)  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
(c)  Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
(d)  International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 was jointly released by Concern Worldwide (an Ireland-based NGO) and Welthungerhilfe (a German NGO).  The report detailed concerning global hunger levels, emphasizing the severity in 42 countries and highlighting the interconnectedness of hunger with factors like gender inequality and climate change.  The WFP, FAO, and IFAD, while all involved in combating hunger, are not specifically responsible for publishing the GHI. The GHI report's findings, including its methodology and data analysis, are distinct from the reports and activities of these other organizations.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. The unique collaboration between Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe in producing the GHI report is a key aspect that distinguishes it from other hunger-related publications.


**2.  The Union Government issued a Letter of Intent (LoI) to which university to establish a campus in Gurugram, India, under the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023?**

(a)  University of Oxford

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The University of Southampton, United Kingdom, was granted a Letter of Intent by the Union Government to establish a campus in Gurugram, India. This marked a significant milestone, as it was the first international university to set up a campus in India under the newly established UGC regulations of 2023.  The regulations aim to enhance India's higher education landscape by incorporating a global dimension. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all prestigious universities but were not the recipients of this particular LoI. The specific choice of the University of Southampton highlights the government's strategic approach to selecting international partners for this initiative.  The selection criteria involved ranking within the top 500 globally or demonstrating exceptional expertise in a specific field.

(a)  The Sexual Offences Act, 2012
(b)  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(c)  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013
(d)  The Indian Penal Code, 1860

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) specifically addresses sexual harassment in the workplace. It provides a framework for preventing such harassment, establishing mechanisms for reporting and investigating complaints, and offering redressal to victims.  The Act defines sexual harassment, outlines the composition and responsibilities of ICCs and LCCs, and aims to create a safer work environment for women.  While options (a), (b), and (d) deal with related legal matters, they do not directly address workplace sexual harassment with the specific mechanisms and provisions of the POSH Act.  The POSH Act's comprehensive approach to tackling workplace sexual harassment, including its focus on prevention and redressal, makes it a landmark legislation in India.


**4.  Which global standard framework for producing health accounts, facilitating international comparisons, classifies health expenditures according to consumption, provision, and financing, and is a result of cooperation between OECD, WHO, and Eurostat?**

(a)  International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
(b)  Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study
(c)  System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011
(d)  World Health Statistics

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 is a globally recognized framework for producing standardized health accounts.  It allows for meaningful comparisons of health expenditure data across different countries.  The SHA 2011's classification system, which categorizes health expenditures by consumption, provision, and financing, is crucial for understanding health financing patterns and resource allocation.  The SHA 2011 is a product of collaboration between the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Health Organization (WHO), and Eurostat (the statistical office of the European Union).  Options (a), (b), and (d) are related to health data and statistics but do not provide the comprehensive framework for health accounting that the SHA offers.  The SHA's contribution to global health data comparability and analysis is significant for policymaking and resource allocation.

(a)  Eliminating the role of national health authorities in pandemic response.
(b)  Establishing a coordinating financial mechanism to support developing countries.
(c)  Reducing the scope of the IHR to focus solely on infectious diseases.
(d)  Removing the legally binding nature of the IHR.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The amendments to the IHR, 2005, approved at the 77th WHA, included the establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism. This mechanism is designed to specifically address the needs and priorities of developing countries in responding to public health emergencies. The inclusion of this mechanism reflects a commitment to ensuring equitable access to resources and support for nations often disproportionately affected by pandemics. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. The amendments strengthened, not weakened, the role of national health authorities, maintained a broad scope encompassing various public health threats, and upheld the legally binding nature of the IHR. The focus on supporting developing countries through a dedicated financial mechanism represents a crucial improvement in the global response to future pandemics.


**6. Which initiative, launched by the Prime Minister, aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods through convergence and outreach, drawing lessons from PM-JANMAN?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)
(c)  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(d)  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is a government initiative specifically designed to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India.  The scheme focuses on addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood opportunities.  PM-JUGA incorporates lessons learned from the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN) to enhance its effectiveness.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are other government schemes, but they do not focus on the comprehensive development of tribal communities in the same manner as PM-JUGA. The name itself, referencing Birsa Munda ("Dharti Aaba"), underscores the scheme's focus on empowering tribal populations and addressing historical inequalities.


**7. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, released by the Ministry of Education, includes which of the following new categories for ranking educational institutions?**

(a)  Only Private Universities
(b)  Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities
(c)  Only Central Universities
(d)  Only Deemed-to-be Universities


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The NIRF 2024 rankings introduced new categories for Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities. This expansion reflects a broader approach to evaluating the Indian higher education system, encompassing a wider range of institutions and their specific contributions. The inclusion of these categories recognizes the importance of diverse learning pathways and institutional models within the Indian education landscape. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they do not represent the full range of new categories added in NIRF 2024. The addition of these categories demonstrates the government's commitment to promoting quality and inclusivity across different segments of the higher education sector.


**8.  Which of the following is NOT a key finding from the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, concerning trends in health expenditure?**

(a)  An increase in Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP.
(b)  A decrease in Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as a percentage of THE.
(c)  An increase in Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) as a percentage of THE.
(d)  A significant increase in Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of THE exceeding 70%.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** While the NHA Estimates for India show increases in Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP, a decrease in Out-of-Pocket Expenditures (OOPE) as a percentage of THE, and an increase in Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) as a percentage of THE, the increase in Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of THE did not exceed 70%.  The NHA data reveals a substantial increase in GHE's share of THE, but it remains below the 70% mark.  Therefore, option (d) presents an inaccurate representation of the findings. The other options accurately reflect trends observed in the NHA data, offering valuable insights into the changing dynamics of health financing in India. The detailed breakdown of expenditure categories provided by the NHA is crucial for policy formulation and resource allocation in the health sector.


**1.  A government initiative aims to uplift tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood.  Which of the following accurately reflects a key component of this initiative?**

(a)  Exclusive funding through newly established Central government schemes dedicated solely to tribal development.
(b)  A ten-year plan focusing on skill development and entrepreneurship primarily through private sector investment.
(c)  Utilization of existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.
(d)  Implementation of the initiative solely by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, bypassing other relevant ministries.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the text explicitly states that the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) leverages existing DAPST grants from Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  Option (a) is incorrect as the initiative doesn't rely on newly established schemes; it utilizes existing funding mechanisms. Option (b) is incorrect because the initiative's tenure is five years, not ten, and it involves multiple ministries, not solely private investment. Option (d) is incorrect because the initiative involves 17 line ministries in its implementation, demonstrating a collaborative approach rather than exclusive reliance on the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the initiative's funding mechanisms.  The use of existing resources is a key aspect of the program's design, highlighting efficient resource allocation and avoiding the creation of entirely new bureaucratic structures.


**2.  A national mission aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India.  Which of the following is NOT a stated goal of this mission?**

(a)  Ensuring pucca houses for eligible households with access to water, electricity, and healthcare services.
(b)  Achieving universal access to quality education for tribal students, aligning with national standards.
(c)  Promoting skill development and entrepreneurship, fostering self-employment opportunities among tribal youth.
(d)  Establishing exclusive, separate educational institutions for tribal children, independent of the national education system.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d). While the mission aims for universal access to quality education (Goal 3), it doesn't advocate for separate, segregated institutions.  The mission aims to integrate tribal children into the national education system, improving existing infrastructure and access to quality education. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all explicitly stated goals of the mission, focusing on improving housing, healthcare, education, and economic opportunities.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the mission's inclusive approach to development, contrasting it with potentially exclusionary practices. The incorrect option highlights a potential misconception about the mission's objectives, emphasizing its commitment to integration rather than segregation.


**3.  A significant government initiative focuses on the comprehensive development of tribal communities.  Which of the following best describes its approach to monitoring and evaluation?**

(a)  A separate, independent monitoring agency will be established to track progress and report directly to the Prime Minister's Office.
(b)  Monitoring will be carried out through traditional methods, relying on periodic reports from state-level officials.
(c)  The initiative will be mapped and monitored using the PM Gati Shakti Portal.
(d)  No formal monitoring mechanism is in place; success will be assessed through qualitative feedback from the beneficiaries.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c). The text explicitly mentions that the PM Gati Shakti Portal will be used for mapping and monitoring the villages covered under the Abhiyan. Option (a) is incorrect because the text doesn't mention the creation of a separate agency. Option (b) is incorrect as the initiative utilizes a modern technological approach to monitoring. Option (d) is incorrect because the use of the PM Gati Shakti Portal demonstrates a structured monitoring system. This question assesses the candidate's ability to recall specific details about the initiative's implementation and monitoring framework. The use of the PM Gati Shakti Portal highlights the government's emphasis on data-driven decision-making and transparency in its development programs.


**4.  An initiative aims to improve the lives of tribal communities across India.  What is the primary source of funding for this initiative?**

(a)  International aid and grants from foreign governments.
(b)  Newly created taxes and levies specifically targeted at funding tribal development programs.
(c)  Existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.
(d)  Private sector donations and philanthropic contributions.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The provided text clearly states that the funding for the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) comes from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they are not the primary funding source mentioned in the text.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the initiative's financial framework and resource allocation strategy.  The use of existing funds emphasizes fiscal prudence and efficient utilization of existing resources.


**5.  A major government program focuses on improving the lives of tribal people in India.  What is the duration of this program?**

(a)  Ten years
(b)  Fifteen years
(c)  Five years
(d)  Twenty years

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The text explicitly states that the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) has a tenure of five years (2024-25 to 2028-29). Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not reflect the duration specified in the provided text.  This question tests factual recall.  The five-year timeframe suggests a structured, phased approach to achieving the program's goals, allowing for regular review and adaptation as needed.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Science and Technology,  with detailed explanations.  The questions aim for a difficult level, requiring in-depth understanding and recall of specific details.


**1.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), launched in 2015, employs a multi-faceted approach to evaluate educational institutions. Which of the following is NOT a parameter used in the NIRF ranking methodology?**

(a) Teaching, Learning, and Resources
(b) Research and Professional Practices
(c)  Student Satisfaction Surveys
(d) Outreach and Inclusivity

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NIRF ranking framework uses five key parameters: Teaching, Learning, and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.  While student feedback is undoubtedly valuable,  student satisfaction surveys are not explicitly listed as one of the five core parameters used in the NIRF calculation.  The NIRF relies on a more structured and data-driven approach to assess institutions, incorporating various quantifiable metrics within each of the five main categories. Option (a), (b), and (d) are all core parameters directly involved in the NIRF ranking process.  The inclusion of "Innovation" as a ranking parameter highlights the framework’s emphasis on cutting-edge research and development within educational institutions.  Option (c) represents a plausible distractor because student feedback is often considered in holistic institutional evaluations, but it is not a primary parameter within the specific NIRF methodology.


**2.  The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, aims to uplift PVTGs while preserving their cultural heritage. Which of the following is NOT a characteristic typically used to identify a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG)?**

(a) Forest-based livelihoods
(b) Pre-agricultural level of existence
(c) High literacy rates
(d) A stagnant or declining population

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The identification of PVTGs involves assessing several socio-economic and demographic factors.  The criteria typically include dependence on forest resources for sustenance (forest-based livelihoods), a pre-agricultural or subsistence-level economy, a stagnant or declining population, and extremely low literacy rates.  These factors collectively indicate a high degree of vulnerability and the need for targeted intervention. Option (c), high literacy rates, directly contradicts the vulnerability criteria used to identify PVTGs.  High literacy rates generally suggest better access to education and improved socio-economic conditions, which are not characteristic of groups considered particularly vulnerable. Options (a), (b), and (d) all represent accurate criteria used for identifying PVTGs, highlighting their vulnerability and the need for focused development programs.


**3.  The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to comprehensively improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. Which ministry is the primary implementing agency for the Tribal Home Stay initiative under PM-JUGA?**

(a) Ministry of Tribal Affairs
(b) Ministry of Rural Development
(c) Ministry of Tourism
(d) Ministry of Women and Child Development


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA employs a multi-ministry approach for convergence of various schemes.  The Tribal Home Stay initiative, aiming to leverage tourism potential for tribal economic empowerment, is specifically mentioned as being promoted under the Swadesh Darshan scheme.  The Swadesh Darshan scheme falls under the purview of the Ministry of Tourism. While the Ministry of Tribal Affairs plays a central role in overall tribal development, the implementation of the Tribal Home Stay program is specifically linked to the Ministry of Tourism's initiatives to support sustainable tourism and community-based initiatives.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are involved in various aspects of tribal welfare but are not the primary implementing agency for the Tribal Home Stay initiative.  This question tests the understanding of inter-ministerial coordination within the larger PM-JUGA framework.


**4. The National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development is known as:**

(a)  Bal Vikas
(b)  Aadharshila
(c)  Shiksha Setu
(d)  Pratibha

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Women and Child Development launched "Aadharshila," meaning "foundation stone," as the National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE).  This curriculum aims to provide a structured learning framework for children aged three to six years in anganwadis (rural childcare centers). Options (a), (c), and (d) are plausible distractors as they sound like potential names for educational initiatives, but they are not the actual name of the specific ECCE curriculum launched by the MoWCD.  The question tests knowledge of specific government initiatives in the education sector, requiring precise recall of the program's name.


**5.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, grants habitat rights to certain tribal groups.  Which of the following statements about habitat rights under the FRA is INCORRECT?**

(a) Habitat rights are granted to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).
(b)  The FRA defines ‘habitat’ as encompassing customary habitats and other habitats within reserved and protected forests.
(c) Habitat rights are granted without any consultation with stakeholders.
(d)  The granting of habitat rights involves a process of consultation with multiple stakeholders.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FRA, 2006, recognizes the rights of forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers, including habitat rights.  The Act explicitly mentions that habitat rights are granted after a sequence of consultations with stakeholders, including the tribal communities themselves, forest officials, and other relevant authorities. Option (c) is incorrect because the process of granting habitat rights is participatory and consultative. Options (a), (b), and (d) accurately reflect key provisions of the FRA concerning habitat rights, emphasizing the legal framework's emphasis on community participation and the recognition of customary rights.  The question tests an understanding of the legal provisions and implementation processes related to forest rights.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to test various cognitive skills relevant to the UPSC examination.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  A legal challenge highlighted persistent caste-based discrimination within prisons, focusing on segregation of barracks, division of labor, and discriminatory provisions against specific groups. Which constitutional articles were cited as being violated in this case?**

(a) Articles 14, 15, 16, 21, and 22
(b) Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23
(c) Articles 14, 16, 17, 22, and 23
(d) Articles 15, 16, 17, 21, and 22

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the Supreme Court case, *Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others*, specifically mentioned the violation of Articles 14 (right to equality), 15 (prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth), 17 (abolition of untouchability), 21 (protection of life and personal liberty), and 23 (prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour).  These articles directly address the issues of caste-based discrimination and the denial of fundamental rights within the prison system. Option (a) includes Article 16 (equality of opportunity in matters of public employment), and Articles 22 (protection against arrest and detention in certain cases) which are not directly relevant to the core issue of caste-based discrimination within prison walls. Options (c) and (d) similarly include irrelevant articles and omit crucial ones. The case highlighted the unconstitutionality of the discriminatory practices within prisons, emphasizing the violation of fundamental rights guaranteed by these specific articles.  Understanding the nuances of these articles is crucial for comprehending the legal basis of the judgment and its implications for social justice.


**2.  The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Which of the following is NOT a primary goal of this scheme?**

(a)  Ensuring all-weather road connectivity to tribal-majority villages.
(b)  Promoting skill development and entrepreneurship among tribal populations.
(c)  Implementing a nationwide ban on the use of traditional tribal practices.
(d)  Increasing the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in education for tribal students.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c). PM-JUGA focuses on improving infrastructure, promoting economic empowerment through skill development and entrepreneurship, and enhancing access to education for tribal communities.  The scheme aims to uplift tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure and fostering economic opportunities.  Option (c) is incorrect because PM-JUGA does not aim to ban traditional tribal practices; instead, it seeks to empower tribal communities while respecting their cultural heritage.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all core components of the PM-JUGA initiative. The scheme's approach is one of empowerment and development, not suppression of cultural practices. This understanding is crucial for evaluating government initiatives aimed at improving the lives of marginalized groups.


**3.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) launched several key initiatives. Which of the following is NOT one of the initiatives announced by ANRF?**

(a)  Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(b)  Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(c)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
(d)  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c).  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is a separate initiative by the Ministry of Education, not a program directly under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF).  While both ANRF and NIRF aim to improve India's research and educational landscape, they are distinct entities.  ANRF's initiatives, PAIR, MAHA, and ACE, are focused on fostering research and innovation directly. NIRF, on the other hand, provides a framework for ranking institutions based on various parameters.  Understanding the distinction between these two bodies and their respective roles is important for analyzing India's higher education and research policies.


**4. The  Forest Rights Act (FRA) grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  Which section of the FRA specifically addresses these rights?**

(a) Section 3(1)(a)
(b) Section 3(1)(c)
(c) Section 3(1)(e)
(d) Section 3(1)(g)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). Section 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), specifically addresses habitat rights for PVTGs. This section is crucial in recognizing and protecting the traditional rights of these vulnerable groups over their ancestral lands and habitats.  Options (a), (b), and (d) refer to other provisions within the Act, dealing with different aspects of forest rights, but not specifically habitat rights for PVTGs.  A thorough understanding of the FRA and its various sections is essential for analyzing policies related to tribal rights and forest conservation.


**5.  Which of the following accurately describes the relationship between Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and nomadic tribes?**

(a) All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
(b) All DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.
(c) There is no relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes.
(d)  DNTs and nomadic tribes are completely separate and distinct categories with no overlap.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  While not all nomadic tribes were classified as DNTs, all DNTs were, at one point, considered nomadic or semi-nomadic groups.  The British-era Criminal Tribes Act wrongly labeled certain communities as "criminal by birth," leading to their denotification after independence. Many of these denotified communities were nomadic or semi-nomadic in nature.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the historical relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes.  Understanding this historical context is crucial for evaluating policies concerning the rights and well-being of these marginalized communities and is important for comprehending the social and political implications of historical classifications.


**1.  Concerning the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), which statement is accurate regarding its financial support and implementation timeline?**

(a) It is solely funded through newly allocated central government funds and will run for 10 years.
(b)  It utilizes existing DAPST grants under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes and has a 5-year tenure.
(c) It is primarily funded by private sector investment and will operate for an indefinite period.
(d) Funding is a mix of central and state government contributions with a 3-year implementation period.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PM-JUGA leverages pre-existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  This strategic approach avoids the need for fresh budgetary allocations, allowing for efficient resource utilization. The Abhiyan’s planned duration is explicitly stated as five years (2024-25 to 2028-29), focusing on achieving its objectives within a defined timeframe.

(a)  Any land traditionally used by tribal communities for any purpose, regardless of its location.
(b)  Exclusively the land within the boundaries of reserved forests officially designated for tribal use.
(c)  The area encompassing customary habitat and other habitats within reserved and protected forests of specific tribal groups.
(d)  Only the areas traditionally used for agriculture by primitive tribal groups and pre-agricultural communities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The FRA explicitly defines "habitat" as the area comprising customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests used by primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.  Options (a), (b), and (d) provide incomplete or inaccurate representations of the FRA's definition. Option (a) is too broad, (b) is too restrictive, and (d) excludes crucial groups.  The precise phrasing in option (c) reflects the legal definition, indicating a nuanced understanding of the FRA's provisions.  The specificity of the definition highlights the legal complexities surrounding land rights and the importance of understanding the precise legal language used in the FRA.  This accurate understanding is crucial for analyzing the legal framework surrounding tribal land rights in India.

(b)  The categorization of all nomadic tribes as Denotified Tribes (DNTs).
(c)  Discriminatory provisions in prison manuals targeting DNTs and "habitual offenders."
(d)  Violation of fundamental rights, including Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23 of the Constitution.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court ruling clarified that not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  This directly contradicts option (b).  Options (a), (c), and (d) accurately reflect the key concerns addressed in the judgment: caste-based discrimination in prisons, discriminatory prison manual provisions, and the violation of fundamental rights. The distinction between nomadic tribes and DNTs, as highlighted by the incorrect statement in (b), demonstrates a crucial understanding of the legal complexities surrounding the rights of marginalized communities.  The judgment's focus on fundamental rights underscores the importance of upholding constitutional guarantees for all citizens.

This question tests factual recall of SDG targets and their alignment with specific global initiatives.  It also requires candidates to evaluate the relative importance of different SDGs within the context of the alliance's stated goals, demonstrating analytical and evaluative skills.


**4.  A report focuses on the financial resources directed towards eliminating hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition, encompassing public and private funding, both domestic and foreign.  This report emphasizes the availability, access, utilization, and stability of nutritious food while strengthening agri-food systems. Which report is described?**

(a) The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)

(a) SDG 1 (No Poverty)
(b) SDG 2 (Zero Hunger)
(c) SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)
(d) SDG 13 (Climate Action)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that the Food Waste Index Report supports the goals of SDG 12.3, which falls under SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). While food waste has implications for hunger (SDG 2) and climate change (SDG 13), the report's primary focus aligns with SDG 12.

(d)  Establishing Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs) to facilitate better access to markets.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** PM-JUGA focuses on improving social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods of tribal communities.  The text mentions initiatives like upgrading schools, promoting homestays, and creating marketing centers.  Providing a universal basic income is not mentioned as a core component of PM-JUGA. While income support might be a part of broader social welfare programs, it is not explicitly stated as a central feature of PM-JUGA, which emphasizes infrastructure development, skill enhancement, and market access.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  Each question is designed to be challenging, with plausible distractors, and avoids direct reproduction of the source material.


**1.  A crucial aspect of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) is its definition of "habitat." Which statement best reflects this definition within the context of the FRA?**

(a)  It solely encompasses the customary habitat of primitive tribal groups within reserved forests.
(b)  It includes customary habitats and other habitats in reserved and protected forests, specifically for pre-agricultural communities.
(c) It defines habitat as the area comprising the customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.
(d) It focuses exclusively on the protected forest areas inhabited by Scheduled Tribes engaged in traditional forest-based livelihoods.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately reflects the FRA's comprehensive definition of "habitat."  The Act recognizes not only the customary habitats but also extends the definition to include other habitats within reserved and protected forests utilized by various categories of forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes (STs). Options (a) and (d) are too narrow, omitting crucial elements of the definition. Option (b), while partially correct, doesn't encompass the full range of STs included in the definition. The FRA's broad definition is crucial for ensuring the protection and rights of diverse tribal communities dependent on forest resources.  This understanding is essential for comprehending the scope and impact of the FRA on tribal livelihoods and conservation efforts.


**2. The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme is a centrally sponsored initiative. Which of the following statements most accurately describes its funding mechanism?**

(a) It receives funding from a combination of central and state government allocations, with a 50/50 split.
(b)  Funding is entirely dependent on contributions from non-governmental organizations and international aid agencies.
(c) It is funded 100% through central assistance in the form of grants-in-aid and the creation of capital assets.
(d) Funding is primarily sourced through private sector investments, supplemented by limited central government grants.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) correctly identifies the funding mechanism of the PVTG scheme. It's a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning the central government provides 100% of the funding. This funding is channeled through grants-in-aid to support various developmental activities and the creation of capital assets in areas inhabited by PVTGs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the scheme's funding structure. The 100% central funding highlights the government's commitment to the socio-economic upliftment of PVTGs.  This centralized funding model ensures consistency and facilitates targeted interventions for the most vulnerable tribal groups.


**3.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 highlights several key concerns.  Which of the following is NOT a major finding or implication discussed in the report's analysis?**

(a)  The report indicates that hunger levels in many countries are alarming, making the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 unattainable.
(b) The report establishes a direct causal link between increased agricultural productivity and a significant reduction in global hunger levels.
(c) The report emphasizes the connection between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.
(d) The report notes that women and girls are disproportionately affected by food insecurity and malnutrition.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the GHI report strongly links various factors to hunger (gender inequality, climate change, etc.), it doesn't establish a direct causal link between *increased* agricultural productivity and a *significant* reduction in global hunger. Increased agricultural output doesn't automatically translate into improved food security for vulnerable populations due to factors like unequal distribution, poverty, and market access. Options (a), (c), and (d) are all supported by the GHI findings.  The report's nuanced perspective on the multifaceted nature of hunger is crucial for developing effective policies that address the root causes of food insecurity, rather than solely focusing on production increases.

(a)  Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(b)  Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(c)  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
(d) ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) is a separate initiative under the Ministry of Education, not directly a program of the ANRF.  The ANRF focuses on fostering research and innovation, while the NIRF ranks educational institutions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all key initiatives launched under the ANRF, reflecting its multi-pronged approach to boosting research capabilities in India.  Understanding the distinction between these initiatives is crucial for comprehending the Indian government's strategies for promoting research and higher education.


**5.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. Which of the following is NOT a primary goal under this Abhiyan?**

(a)  Developing enabling infrastructure, including road connectivity and access to communication technologies.
(b)  Promoting economic empowerment through skill development, entrepreneurship, and livelihood support.
(c)  Ensuring access to quality education and healthcare, aligned with national standards.
(d)  Implementing a nationwide ban on all forms of forest-based livelihoods among tribal communities.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA aims to improve the lives of tribal communities while respecting their traditional livelihoods.  A nationwide ban on forest-based livelihoods would directly contradict the Abhiyan's goals. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all core objectives of PM-JUGA, highlighting its holistic approach to tribal development.  The Abhiyan seeks to empower tribal communities by providing access to essential infrastructure, improving educational and healthcare facilities, and fostering sustainable economic opportunities.  This approach recognizes the importance of integrating development efforts with respect for tribal cultures and traditional practices.


**6. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  In which state can we find the Paudi Bhuyans, a tribe recognized for having habitat rights under the FRA?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Odisha
(d) Maharashtra


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Paudi Bhuyans are a tribe residing in Odisha and are explicitly mentioned in the provided text as having been granted habitat rights under the FRA.  The other options are incorrect; while other PVTGs are mentioned in those states, the Paudi Bhuyans are specifically located in Odisha.  Knowing the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups is important for targeted policy interventions and the effective implementation of the FRA.


**7.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) has a specific objective. Which of the following statements best captures that objective?**

(a) To establish quotas for persons with disabilities in government employment.
(b) To promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.
(c) To provide financial assistance to all individuals with disabilities.
(d) To limit the participation of persons with disabilities in competitive sports.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) accurately reflects the overarching objective of the UN-CRPD. The Convention aims to guarantee the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities, emphasizing their inherent dignity. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they represent specific measures or misconceptions, rather than the broad and fundamental objective of the Convention. Understanding this core objective is crucial for interpreting the Convention's provisions and for advocating for the rights of persons with disabilities.


**8.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 tracks food waste at different levels. Which Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) does it directly support?**

(a) SDG 2: Zero Hunger
(b) SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
(c) SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
(d) SDG 13: Climate Action


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index Report directly supports SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, specifically focusing on indicators related to reducing food loss and waste. While reducing food waste contributes to achieving other SDGs (like SDG 2: Zero Hunger and SDG 13: Climate Action), the report's primary focus and alignment are with SDG 12.  Understanding this connection is crucial for appreciating the global efforts to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns.

(a) The amount of food wasted in restaurants globally.
(b) The amount of food wasted during transportation and storage.
(c) Global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels.
(d) The economic impact of food waste on developing countries.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The report's core focus is on quantifying food waste at the retail and consumer levels (households and food services) at both national and international scales. While options (a), (b), and (d) are related to food waste, the FWI specifically targets retail and consumer-level waste generation.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on science and technology, along with detailed explanations:


**1.  A legal framework exists in India to safeguard the rights and well-being of a specific group of individuals facing significant societal challenges.  Which of the following accurately describes a key component of this framework?**

(a)  The framework mandates a 10% reservation in all government jobs for this group.
(b)  It includes provisions for appointing "limited guardians" to assist individuals who cannot make their own decisions, even with support.
(c)  The framework focuses exclusively on providing financial assistance and does not address educational opportunities.
(d) The framework explicitly excludes private sector involvement in promoting the inclusion of this group.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the provided text explicitly mentions the concept of "limited guardianship" as a crucial part of the legal framework for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in India.  This mechanism is designed to support PwDs who lack the capacity to make legally binding decisions, even with assistance.  Option (a) is incorrect as the reservation percentage mentioned in the text is 4% for government jobs and 5% for higher educational institutions. Option (c) is false because the framework includes provisions for free education (6-18 years) and incentivizes private sector employment of PwDs. Option (d) is inaccurate; the government actively encourages private sector participation through incentives. The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of the legal framework for PwDs in India.


**2.  A significant international agreement aims to improve global preparedness and response to public health crises. Which of the following is a key amendment introduced in this agreement?**

(a)  The agreement eliminates the need for national health authorities to coordinate responses to pandemics.
(b)  It defines a pandemic emergency solely based on the mortality rate of a communicable disease.
(c)  The agreement establishes a coordinating financial mechanism to assist developing nations in their pandemic response efforts.
(d)  The agreement removes the legal obligation of member states to participate in global health surveillance.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the text explicitly mentions the establishment of a "Coordinating Financial Mechanism" as a key amendment to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005. This mechanism is specifically designed to address the needs of developing countries in managing public health emergencies. Option (a) is incorrect; the amendments aim to *improve* coordination through the creation of National IHR Authorities. Option (b) is false; the definition includes "wide geographical spread" and exceeding national health system response capabilities, not solely mortality rates. Option (d) is incorrect; the IHR remains a legally binding framework outlining member states' obligations. The question tests factual recall about the IHR amendments and their implications for global health security.


**3.  The Indian government has introduced a policy designed to enhance the accessibility of higher education.  Which of the following is a key feature of this policy?**

(a)  It mandates that all foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) must establish campuses solely in major metropolitan areas.
(b)  It prohibits the transfer of academic credits between Indian institutions and FHEI campuses.
(c)  It grants FHEIs autonomy to determine the qualifications, salary structure, and other conditions of service for their faculty and staff.
(d)  The policy requires FHEIs to obtain final approval before establishing campuses in India, eliminating the initial in-principal approval stage.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately reflects a key feature of the UGC guidelines for recognizing foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) in India. The guidelines grant FHEIs considerable autonomy in managing their faculty and staff.  Option (a) is incorrect; the policy doesn't restrict campus locations. Option (b) is false; the policy explicitly permits credit transfers between Indian institutions and FHEI campuses. Option (d) is incorrect as the policy involves an initial in-principal approval followed by a Letter of Intent (LoI) and campus establishment within two years.  This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the policy's implications for higher education in India.


**4.  A significant piece of legislation in India addresses a pervasive social issue. Which of the following is NOT a provision of this legislation?**

(a)  The Act defines domestic violence to encompass physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.
(b)  The Act is applicable only to women of a specific religious or social background.
(c)  The Act provides for the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) and Local Complaints Committees (LCCs).
(d)  The Act empowers the legislature to make special provisions for women and children.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is incorrect. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, explicitly states its applicability to all women regardless of their religious or social background.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are accurate reflections of the PWDVA's provisions, covering the definition of domestic violence, complaint mechanisms, and the constitutional basis for its enactment (Article 15(3)).  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the scope and provisions of the PWDVA.  The subtle difference between options makes it a difficult question.


**5. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, in India aims to combat a persistent social problem.  Which of the following is a key guideline issued by the Supreme Court to enhance the enforcement of this Act?**

(a) The guideline mandates the complete abolition of all personal laws related to marriage.
(b)  It recommends establishing a technology-driven monitoring system to track the daily attendance of school-going girls up to the 12th grade.
(c) It suggests that all child marriage cases should be handled exclusively by the Supreme Court itself.
(d) The guideline directs that all marriages must be registered with religious authorities regardless of age.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly identifies a key guideline issued by the Supreme Court to strengthen the enforcement of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006.  The guideline emphasizes the importance of monitoring school attendance to help prevent child marriages. Option (a) is incorrect; the Supreme Court didn't mandate the abolition of personal laws. Option (c) is false; the guidelines suggest exploring special fast-track courts, not exclusive handling by the Supreme Court. Option (d) is incorrect; the focus is on prohibiting child marriages, not mandatory registration irrespective of age.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the Supreme Court's efforts to address child marriage.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on science and technology, health, and education,  with detailed explanations:


**1.  Which international organization's legally binding framework defines countries' rights and obligations in handling cross-border public health emergencies?**

(a)  The World Trade Organization (WTO)
(b)  The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
(c)  The World Health Organization (WHO)
(d)  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005), a legally binding instrument, are developed and managed by the World Health Organization (WHO).  The IHR defines the rights and obligations of countries in managing public health events that have the potential to cross borders.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as their mandates do not directly involve the global coordination of public health responses to international emergencies. The WTO focuses on trade, the IMF on financial stability, and the UNDP on development assistance.  The IHR, therefore, uniquely falls under the WHO's purview, highlighting its critical role in global health security.  The amendments to the IHR, as discussed in the text, further solidify this role and emphasize the need for international cooperation in tackling pandemics.


**2.  The National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates for India, released by which ministry, provide insights into the financial flows within the nation's healthcare system?**

(a) Ministry of Finance
(b) Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation
(c) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(d) Ministry of Ayush


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates are explicitly stated in the provided text as being released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). This ministry is responsible for the overall health policies and programs in India.  The other ministries listed, while involved in various aspects of national development, do not directly oversee the compilation and release of health expenditure data as detailed in the NHA.  The NHA's role in providing a comprehensive picture of health financing, including government and private spending, makes the MoHFW's responsibility crucial for understanding and improving India's healthcare system. The data presented in the NHA, such as total health expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP, is a key indicator for policymaking and resource allocation in the health sector.


**3.  Which organization published the University Impact Rankings 2024, identifying universities excelling across various United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?**

(a)  Times Higher Education (THE)
(b)  QS Quacquarelli Symonds
(c)  ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities)
(d)  U.S. News & World Report


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Times Higher Education (THE) published the University Impact Rankings 2024.  This ranking system is unique in its focus on evaluating universities based on their contribution to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.  QS Quacquarelli Symonds, ARWU, and U.S. News & World Report are other well-known ranking organizations, but they do not specifically publish rankings based on the SDG criteria. The inclusion of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham as a top-ranked Indian institution in the THE ranking highlights the growing importance of universities' social impact in global higher education evaluations.  The mention of India's strong representation in the rankings also indicates the increasing global recognition of Indian universities' contributions to sustainable development.


**4.  The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, aims to facilitate the entry of which category of foreign universities into India?**

(a)  Foreign universities ranked within the top 1000 globally.
(b)  Foreign universities with a specific focus on vocational training.
(c)  Foreign universities ranked in the global top 500, either overall or in specific subject areas, or possessing exceptional expertise.
(d)  Foreign universities that offer online degree programs only.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The regulations explicitly mention that the aim is to facilitate the entry of higher-ranked foreign universities, specifically those ranked within the top 500 globally, either overall or in specific subject areas.  They also include a provision for universities with outstanding expertise in particular fields. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they don't reflect the specific criteria outlined in the regulations.  The focus on top-ranked institutions reflects the government's intention to enhance the quality and internationalization of higher education in India by attracting prestigious universities.  The mention of subject-specific rankings also indicates that the regulations aim to attract expertise in diverse fields, ensuring a more comprehensive development of higher education in India.


**5.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of which specific community in India?**

(a)  Urban poor
(b)  Rural farmers
(c)  Tribal communities
(d)  Migrant workers


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The scheme's full name,  "Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan," directly translates to "Prime Minister's Tribal Upliftment Village Scheme."  The text explicitly states that the objective is to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  The other options are incorrect; while the scheme might indirectly benefit other groups, its primary and stated focus is on tribal communities.  The naming of the scheme after Birsa Munda, a prominent tribal leader, further emphasizes this focus.  The scheme’s design, incorporating learnings from PM-JANMAN, also suggests a targeted approach to addressing the specific challenges faced by tribal populations in India.  This focus on marginalized communities highlights a key aspect of India's development policy.

Option (b), the Biwako Millennium Framework, also relates to disability inclusion. Option (d) is a specific Indian program for PwDs.  The Alliance for Global Good is unique in its global scope and multi-stakeholder approach to women's empowerment, aligning perfectly with the description provided.  Understanding such global initiatives and their key players (WEF, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CII) is crucial for UPSC preparation, as these collaborations often impact global development agendas.


**2.  The 2013 Act, which aims to prevent and address workplace sexual harassment in India, defines "sexual harassment" in accordance with a Supreme Court judgment. This Act is referred to as:**

(a)  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(b)  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013
(c)  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
(d)  The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The question clearly points to the 2013 Act addressing sexual harassment at the workplace. Option (a) pertains to domestic violence, a distinct legal area. Option (c) focuses on juvenile justice, and option (d) deals with mental healthcare.  The 2013 Act is specifically designed to create mechanisms for redressal of sexual harassment complaints, including the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) and Local Complaints Committees (LCCs).  Knowledge of this Act, its provisions (like the composition of ICCs), and its alignment with the Vishaka judgment demonstrates understanding of crucial legal frameworks for women's protection in India.


**3.  The National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates, released annually by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare since 2013-14, provide a comprehensive analysis of financial flows within India's health system.  These estimates are prepared by which entity?**

(a)  The World Health Organization (WHO)
(b)  The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS)
(c)  The National Green Tribunal (NGT)
(d)  The Rehabilitation Council of India


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question directly asks about the preparer of the NHA estimates.  The correct answer is the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS). The WHO is a global health body, the NGT deals with environmental issues, and the Rehabilitation Council of India focuses on rehabilitation of disabled persons—all irrelevant to the NHA.  Understanding the NHA's purpose (tracking funding sources, expenditure patterns, and healthcare utilization) and the role of NHATS within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is vital for analyzing India's healthcare financing and policy implementation.


**4.  A legal framework, a successor to the International Sanitary Regulations (1951), sets out countries' obligations in managing cross-border public health emergencies.  This framework, recently amended at the 77th World Health Assembly, is known as:**

(a)  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)
(b)  The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005
(c)  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005
(d)  The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question describes the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, which is the legally binding framework for managing public health events with international implications.  The other options are unrelated to international public health. The amendments highlighted in the text reflect the evolving need for stronger global health security mechanisms following events like the Ebola and COVID-19 pandemics.  Knowing the IHR, its objectives, and the role of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in its governance demonstrates awareness of global health governance and India's participation in it.


**5.  Which of the following is NOT a key amendment to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, as agreed upon at the 77th World Health Assembly?**

(a)  Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism for developing countries.
(b)  Creating National IHR Authorities to improve coordination.
(c)  Defining a pandemic emergency based on solely the economic impact.
(d)  Establishing a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** While the amendments did define pandemic emergencies, the definition was not solely based on economic impact. The key criteria included "wide geographical spread" or a high risk of it, and exceeding the capacity of national health systems. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all accurate descriptions of the amendments.  Understanding the nuances of the IHR amendments and the reasons behind them reflects an ability to analyze global health policy developments critically.  The inclusion of a plausible distractor (economic impact) makes this a challenging question.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.


**1.  A significant Supreme Court case highlighted persistent caste-based discrimination within Indian prisons.  Which of the following best describes the core issue addressed in this landmark judgement?**

(a)  Unequal access to prison healthcare based on caste.
(b)  Discriminatory practices in prison sentencing based on caste affiliation.
(c)  Caste-based segregation and discriminatory labor allocation within prisons.
(d)  Differential access to legal representation for prisoners based on caste.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others case directly challenged the unconstitutionality of caste-based discrimination within prison systems.  The judgement specifically addressed the issues of segregated barracks, the unequal distribution of manual labor tasks, and provisions that explicitly discriminated against prisoners from Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and those categorized as "habitual offenders."  Options (a), (b), and (d), while potentially related to broader caste-based inequalities within the justice system, were not the central focus of this particular case. The core of the ruling was the violation of fundamental rights (Articles 14, 15, 17, 21, and 23) due to the systematic, institutionalised caste-based discrimination within prison walls.  This highlights the persistent challenge of caste-based discrimination even within supposedly egalitarian institutions.


**2.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) grants specific rights to certain tribal groups. Which of the following rights is explicitly addressed under Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA?**

(a)  Rights to collect non-timber forest produce.
(b)  Rights to grazing land within forest areas.
(c)  Rights to the customary habitat of tribal groups within forests.
(b)  Rights to protect, regenerate, or conserve or manage any community forest resource which they have been traditionally protecting and conserving for sustainable use.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA specifically deals with the recognition of habitat rights for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) and other traditional forest dwellers. This right acknowledges the historical and customary relationship between these communities and their forest habitats, granting them legal protection over their traditional lands and resources within the forest. Options (a) and (b) are also rights granted under the FRA, but they fall under different sections and are not the specific focus of Section 3(1)(e). Option (d) is also a right under FRA, but it is not the specific right defined under Section 3(1)(e)


**3. The "Lithium Triangle" is a geographically defined region known for its significant lithium reserves. Which of the following countries correctly constitute the "Lithium Triangle"?**

(a)  Argentina, Brazil, and Peru
(b)  Chile, Bolivia, and Peru
(c)  Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile
(d)  Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "Lithium Triangle" comprises Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. These three South American countries share a vast region rich in lithium deposits, making them key players in the global lithium market.  The other options include countries that are not part of this specific geographically defined region known for its lithium reserves.  Understanding the geographical distribution of natural resources is crucial for geopolitical analysis and economic planning.


**4.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. Which of the following best reflects a key objective of this scheme?**

(a)  Establishing new tribal-run businesses and enterprises.
(b)  Promoting tribal art and culture through international exhibitions.
(c)  Addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, and education.
(d)  Providing financial aid for migration to urban areas.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** PM-JUGA focuses on comprehensively addressing the shortcomings in social infrastructure, healthcare access, and educational opportunities within tribal communities.  The scheme aims to achieve this through convergence and outreach of various existing schemes, aligning with the broader goal of sustainable and inclusive development. Options (a), (b), and (d), while potentially beneficial for tribal communities, are not the primary or central objectives of PM-JUGA.  The scheme prioritizes the improvement of basic living conditions and access to essential services within tribal villages.


**5. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) has a specific objective. Which of the following options best encapsulates this primary objective?**

(a) To provide financial assistance to individuals with disabilities.
(b) To establish specialized educational institutions for persons with disabilities.
(c) To promote the full and equal enjoyment of human rights by all persons with disabilities.
(d) To reserve specific job quotas for persons with disabilities in the public sector.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN-CRPD's core objective is to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. This includes promoting their inherent dignity and preventing discrimination.  The convention focuses on a rights-based approach, emphasizing inclusion and participation in all aspects of society. Options (a), (b), and (d), while potentially supportive measures, are not the overarching objective of the UN-CRPD. The convention seeks to establish a legal framework that upholds the dignity and rights of persons with disabilities on a par with others.


**6.  Several Indian universities are ranked among the top global institutions.  According to the QS World University Rankings 2025, which of the following statements accurately reflects the ranking of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs)?**

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) is ranked at 118 in the QS World University Rankings 2025. This places IIT-B within the top 100 global universities, making option (b) correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are either unsubstantiated or demonstrably false based on the provided information.  The ranking of IITs within the global landscape demonstrates India's progress in higher education.


**7.  The Union Government issued a Letter of Intent (LoI) to allow a foreign university to establish a campus in India. Which regulation governs this initiative?**

(a)  The National Education Policy, 2020.
(b)  The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023.
(c)  The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.
(d)  The Indian Institutes of Technology Act, 1961.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that the LoI issued to the University of Southampton is under the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023. This regulation specifically outlines the criteria and process for foreign universities to establish campuses within India.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are not directly relevant to this specific policy initiative. The establishment of foreign university campuses in India signifies a move towards greater internationalization and diversification of higher education.


**8.  The Global Gender Gap Report 2024, released by the World Economic Forum (WEF),  provides a global ranking of countries based on gender parity. Which of the following is NOT a dimension used in the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)?**

(a)  Economic Participation and Opportunity
(b)  Educational Attainment
(c)  Political Empowerment
(d)  Technological Advancement


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The passage states that the GGGI uses 14 indicators across four key dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Political Empowerment, and Health and Survival.  Technological Advancement is not explicitly mentioned as one of the dimensions used in the GGGI. The report's findings highlight the progress made and the challenges that remain in achieving gender equality across different dimensions of society.  The ranking of countries reflects the varying levels of gender parity achieved globally.


**9.  The Vulnerability Reduction Fund (VRF) serves a specific purpose within a social welfare program.  What is the primary function of the VRF?**

(a)  Providing scholarships for higher education.
(b)  Addressing vulnerabilities like food insecurity and health risks faced by households.
(c)  Funding infrastructure development projects in rural areas.
(d)  Supporting entrepreneurship initiatives among women.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly states that the VRF is a corpus fund used to address vulnerabilities such as food insecurity, health risks, hospitalization, and natural calamities faced by households or communities.  Options (a), (c), and (d) describe different social welfare initiatives but do not reflect the specific purpose of the VRF.  The VRF plays a crucial role in providing immediate support and mitigating risks faced by vulnerable populations.


**10.  The Asmita Project, launched by the Union Ministry of Education, has a specific goal.  Which of the following best describes the primary aim of this project?**

(a)  Promoting digital literacy among students.
(b)  Enhancing access to high-quality study materials in Indian languages.
(c)  Establishing new schools in rural areas.
(d)  Developing a national curriculum for higher education.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that the Asmita Project aims to ensure that students have access to high-quality study materials in their native languages.  This involves the production of educational resources in 22 scheduled languages, aligned with the promotion of multilingualism in education. Options (a), (c), and (d) are not the primary focus of the Asmita Project. The project contributes to the broader goal of making education more inclusive and accessible to diverse linguistic communities within India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on science and technology,  tribal affairs, and other relevant topics.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills.

**1.  A government scheme aims for the comprehensive socio-economic development of specific tribal groups while preserving their cultural heritage.  Which scheme aligns with this description?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
(b) PM Gram Sadak Yojana
(c) Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme
(d) National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme" explicitly focuses on the holistic socio-economic upliftment of PVTGs while emphasizing the preservation of their unique cultural identity and traditions.  Options (a), (b), and (d) address housing, rural road connectivity, and food security respectively, but not the specific and combined goals of socio-economic development and cultural preservation for vulnerable tribal groups as the PVTGs scheme does. The PVTGs scheme employs a micro-plan approach through Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans, demonstrating its commitment to a nuanced and community-specific strategy. This targeted approach distinguishes it from broader national schemes.  The scheme's 100% central funding further underscores its significance and prioritization by the government.


**2. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006 grants a specific right to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). What is this right?**

(a) Right to free education
(b) Right to healthcare
(c) Habitat rights
(d) Right to food security

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Section 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) explicitly grants habitat rights to PVTGs. This right recognizes the traditional and customary use of forest lands by these groups.  While the FRA indirectly contributes to other rights like education, healthcare, and food security through improved livelihoods and access to resources, the specific right directly conferred by the FRA to PVTGs is the right to their habitat.  The FRA's recognition of habitat rights is a critical step towards ensuring the survival and well-being of PVTGs, who often have a deep dependence on forest ecosystems.  This is a significant departure from previous policies that often overlooked or marginalized the claims of forest-dwelling communities.


**3.  A National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) was recently launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. What is the name of this curriculum?**

(a)  Bal Vikas
(b)  Pratibha
(c)  Aadharshila
(d)  Shiksha

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Ministry of Women and Child Development launched "Aadharshila" (meaning "foundation stone"), a comprehensive 48-week curriculum designed for children aged three to six years in Anganwadis.  This curriculum aims to provide a strong foundation for early childhood development, incorporating play-based learning and academic activities to facilitate a smooth transition from home to the Anganwadi setting. The name itself reflects the curriculum's ambition to build a solid base for the child's future education. The curriculum's weekly-based play calendar and focus on engaging children in fun and free play are key elements that distinguish it from other educational programs.  Its detailed nature and the integration of academic activities make it a significant initiative in the field of early childhood care and education.


**4. Which of the following organizations released the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, highlighting alarming hunger levels in several countries?**

(a) World Food Programme (WFP)
(b) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(c) Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
(d) UNICEF

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 was jointly released by Concern Worldwide (an Ireland-based NGO) and Welthungerhilfe (a German NGO). The report presented a concerning picture of global hunger levels, indicating that the goal of Zero Hunger by 2030 is unattainable based on current trends.  The report also highlighted the linkages between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all important organizations involved in addressing global hunger, but they were not the ones that released the GHI 2024 report.  The involvement of two distinct NGOs in the GHI's release underscores the collaborative nature of efforts to combat global hunger and the need for multi-faceted approaches.


**5.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 introduced new categories for ranking educational institutions. Which of the following is NOT a new category added in NIRF 2024?**

(a) Open Universities
(b) Private Universities
(c) State Public Universities
(d) Skill Universities

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NIRF 2024 rankings included new categories for Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities. Private universities were already included in previous NIRF rankings.  The inclusion of these new categories reflects a broader and more inclusive approach to evaluating Indian higher education institutions, recognizing the diverse landscape of educational providers and their contributions.  The addition of Skill Universities specifically highlights the growing importance of vocational training and skill development in the national education system.  This expansion of categories reflects the evolving priorities and needs of the Indian higher education sector.

(a) Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi
(b) Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay
(c) Indian Institute of Science (IISC) Bangalore
(d) Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras secured the top position in the overall category of the NIRF 2024 rankings for the sixth consecutive year. This consistent performance underscores IIT Madras's excellence across various parameters assessed by the NIRF framework, including teaching, research, and overall institutional impact.  The continued dominance of IIT Madras reflects its strong commitment to academic excellence, research innovation, and the holistic development of its students.  The NIRF ranking is a significant indicator of institutional quality in India, and IIT Madras's consistent top ranking reinforces its reputation as a leading institution of higher learning.



**7.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) aims to promote, protect, and ensure what for all persons with disabilities?**

(a)  Access to healthcare and education
(b)  Economic empowerment and employment opportunities
(c)  Full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms
(d)  Social inclusion and integration into society

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) has a broad mandate.  While the other options are important aspects of the convention, its core objective is to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. This encompasses a wide range of rights, including civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights.  The convention emphasizes the inherent dignity of persons with disabilities and promotes respect for their autonomy and independence.  The UN-CRPD is a landmark international treaty that has significantly advanced the rights of persons with disabilities globally, influencing national policies and promoting greater inclusion.


**8. The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in which areas?**

(a)  Agriculture and infrastructure only
(b)  Social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood
(c)  Education and skill development exclusively
(d)  Health and sanitation primarily

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PM-JUGA scheme has a multi-pronged approach. It focuses on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps across multiple sectors.  These sectors include social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood opportunities.  The scheme adopts a holistic approach, recognizing that addressing socio-economic challenges requires a comprehensive strategy that considers various aspects of community well-being. The scheme's convergence of existing schemes and its focus on saturation of critical gaps demonstrate its commitment to achieving tangible improvements in the lives of tribal communities.  The scheme's five-year tenure (2024-2029) further underscores its long-term commitment to sustainable and impactful change.


**9.  Which Act, repealed in 1949, previously categorized certain communities as "born criminals"?**

(a)  The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act
(b)  The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
(c)  The Protection of Civil Rights Act
(d)  The Untouchability (Offences) Act

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, enacted during British rule, wrongly classified certain nomadic and semi-nomadic communities as "criminal tribes," leading to systemic discrimination and marginalization.  This act was repealed in 1949, and the communities previously designated under this act were subsequently denotified in 1952. The repeal of this Act was a significant step towards addressing historical injustices and promoting the rights and dignity of these communities.  August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNTs (Denotified Tribes) in India, commemorating this important event.  The lingering effects of this discriminatory legislation continue to pose challenges, highlighting the need for continued efforts to address historical injustices and promote social inclusion.


**10.  The University of Southampton, United Kingdom, was granted permission to establish a campus in which Indian city under the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023?**

(a) Mumbai
(b) Bengaluru
(c) Hyderabad
(d) Gurugram

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The University of Southampton received permission to establish its campus in Gurugram, Haryana. This marks a significant development under the UGC regulations, facilitating the entry of globally ranked foreign universities into India.  The establishment of foreign university campuses in India is envisioned to enhance the quality and internationalization of higher education in the country, providing Indian students with access to diverse educational opportunities and global perspectives.  The selection of Gurugram as the location highlights the city's growing importance as an educational and business hub.  The success of this initiative will have significant implications for the future of higher education in India and its global integration.


**1.  A government initiative aims to enhance the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through various schemes.  This initiative, named after a prominent tribal leader who resisted British rule, operates on a five-year tenure and covers a substantial number of villages.  Which of the following correctly identifies this initiative and its key characteristic?**

(a)  PM-JUGA, focusing solely on skill development.
(b)  PM-JUGA, utilizing funds from the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST).
(c)  PM-JANMAN, primarily concentrating on healthcare improvements.
(d)  Swadesh Darshan, promoting tribal tourism exclusively.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the description accurately reflects the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA).  PM-JUGA explicitly aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing various infrastructural and developmental gaps. Its funding mechanism is clearly stated as coming from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.  The scheme is named after Birsa Munda, a significant figure in tribal resistance against British rule. The other options are incorrect. (a) is incorrect because PM-JUGA's scope is far broader than just skill development. (c) is incorrect because PM-JANMAN is a separate initiative, although PM-JUGA builds upon its learnings. (d) is incorrect as Swadesh Darshan is a tourism initiative and while it has components related to tribal home stays, it is not the primary focus of PM-JUGA.  PM-JUGA's comprehensive approach to improve the lives of tribal communities through convergence of various schemes makes option (b) the most appropriate and accurate answer.


**2.  A report highlights the global challenge of hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition, emphasizing the need for increased financial resources to address these issues.  The report proposes a new definition of financing for food security and nutrition, encompassing both public and private resources and aiming to improve the availability, access, utilization, and stability of nutritious food. Which of the following best describes the report and its central theme?**

(a)  The Global Report on Food Crises, focusing on emergency food aid distribution.
(b)  The Food Waste Index Report, emphasizing the reduction of post-harvest losses.
(c)  The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, addressing financing to end hunger and malnutrition.
(d)  The Rome Declaration on Nutrition, committing to eradicating hunger worldwide through international cooperation.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c). The description precisely matches the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024.  The report explicitly focuses on the financing needed to combat hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition. Its core theme revolves around a novel definition of financing for food security and nutrition, which incorporates both domestic and foreign, public and private resources, aiming for improved food availability, access, utilization, and stability. Option (a) is incorrect because the Global Report on Food Crises focuses on the crisis itself, not specifically financing solutions. Option (b) is incorrect as the Food Waste Index Report concentrates on food waste reduction, not the broader financial aspects of food security. Option (d) is incorrect because the Rome Declaration on Nutrition, while relevant to the issue, does not primarily address the financial mechanisms for achieving its goals. Therefore, the detailed focus on financing to end hunger and malnutrition makes (c) the most suitable answer.


**3.  An initiative launched to improve the quality of education in government residential schools and hostels aims to upgrade these facilities to a certain standard. These schools are meant to provide a high-quality education and improved infrastructure.  Which of the following schemes is directly involved in this initiative?**

(a)  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
(b)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
(c)  PM SHRI Schools
(d)  National Health Mission


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the description directly refers to the Pradhan Mantri Schools for Rising India (PM SHRI) scheme.  The passage explicitly mentions improving the infrastructure of government residential schools/hostels, upgrading them on the lines of PM-SHRI Schools. PM SHRI is a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at transforming existing schools, improving their infrastructure, and aligning them with the objectives of the National Education Policy 2020.  The other options are incorrect. While (a) and (d) are related to housing and health, respectively, they are not directly involved in school infrastructure upgrades. (b), Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, is a broader education scheme but the specific mention of upgrading to PM-SHRI standards points to (c) as the most accurate answer.  The focus on upgrading existing schools to a higher standard, as mentioned in the passage, directly links to the PM SHRI scheme.


**4.  A global network brings together governments, international organizations, and NGOs to improve humanitarian responses and reduce the number of people facing acute food insecurity. This network was launched in 2016 by several key international players. Which of the following organizations is most accurately described by this statement?**

(a) GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition)
(b) IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute)
(c) GNAFC (Global Network Against Food Crises)
(d) FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c), the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC). The description accurately portrays the GNAFC's mission and composition.  GNAFC was indeed launched in 2016 by the European Union, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Food Programme (WFP), bringing together governments, international organizations, and NGOs to enhance humanitarian responses and alleviate acute food insecurity.  The other options are incorrect.  GAIN focuses on nutrition, IFPRI on food policy research, and FAO is a single UN agency, not a network of diverse organizations. Therefore, the comprehensive nature of GNAFC's objective and its collaborative structure make (c) the most fitting and accurate answer.  The description aligns precisely with GNAFC's role in coordinating efforts to address the root causes of food crises.


**5.  A legal framework defines the rights and obligations of countries in handling public health emergencies that have the potential to cross borders.  This framework, amended recently, includes provisions for better public health surveillance and response mechanisms.  Which of the following accurately identifies this framework and its recent update?**

(a)  The Rome Declaration on Nutrition
(b)  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)
(c)  Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005
(d)  The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c), Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005.  The description perfectly matches the IHR's purpose and the recent amendments made at the 77th World Health Assembly. The IHR is a legally binding framework that outlines countries' roles in managing cross-border public health events.  The recent amendments emphasize improved surveillance, response, and preparedness mechanisms, addressing shortcomings highlighted by past epidemics and pandemics.  The other options are incorrect.  The Rome Declaration on Nutrition focuses on nutrition, UN-CRPD addresses the rights of people with disabilities, and NQAS relates to quality assurance in healthcare.  The specific mention of a legally binding framework for handling cross-border public health emergencies points directly to the IHR and its recent amendments as the most appropriate answer. The passage’s emphasis on improved mechanisms for handling public health crises aligns perfectly with the IHR’s updated role.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills.


**1.  A government initiative aims to comprehensively address infrastructural deficits, improve healthcare access, boost skill development, and enhance educational opportunities within specific rural communities.  Which of the following accurately describes this initiative's primary focus?**

(a)  Promoting sustainable tourism in underdeveloped regions.
(b)  Empowering Scheduled Tribes through socio-economic upliftment.
(c)  Addressing malnutrition and improving sanitation standards nationwide.
(d)  Facilitating the establishment of foreign university campuses in India.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description clearly points to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), a program explicitly designed to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  The initiative’s goals encompass infrastructure development (roads, connectivity, health facilities, education infrastructure), skill development and entrepreneurship, and increased access to education. Options (a), (c), and (d) represent distinct government programs or broader national goals but do not align with the specific, targeted focus on Scheduled Tribes described in the question.  The PM-JUGA’s multi-pronged approach seeks holistic development within tribal villages, making it the most accurate answer.  The initiative's focus on convergence of existing schemes and saturation of critical gaps also underlines its comprehensive nature.


**2.  A five-year plan, funded through existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, targets approximately 63,000 villages, impacting over 5 crore tribal people.  Which of the following best represents a key objective of this plan?**

(a)  Expanding access to higher education for all citizens.
(b)  Providing universal healthcare coverage across India.
(c)  Improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.
(d)  Strengthening the National Research Foundation's capabilities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description directly relates to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA).  The plan's funding source (DAPST) and its target beneficiaries (tribal communities) explicitly indicate its focus on socio-economic upliftment within tribal populations.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent broader national goals but are not the primary focus of this specific five-year plan.  The plan's extensive coverage (63,000 villages, 5 crore people) and the inclusion of various interventions further emphasize its commitment to improving the lives of Scheduled Tribes.


**3.  The convergence of various government schemes and programs under a single initiative is intended to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood opportunities within a specific demographic.  Which program best exemplifies this approach?**

(a)  The National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN) Bharat Mission.
(b)  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA).
(c)  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission.
(d)  The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY).


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is explicitly designed to achieve its objectives through the convergence of different existing schemes.  The text highlights the integration of multiple programs to achieve holistic development within tribal communities. Options (a), (c), and (d) represent important initiatives but don't have the same emphasis on the convergence of multiple, pre-existing schemes to address multiple facets of development within a particular target group as PM-JUGA does.  The description's focus on "saturation of critical gaps" further supports the selection of PM-JUGA as the best example of this convergence approach.


**4. The establishment of Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs) is a key component of a larger initiative aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of a specific population group. Which of the following is the most direct benefit of these centres?**

(a)  Increased access to higher education for tribal students.
(b)  Improved healthcare infrastructure in tribal areas.
(c)  Enhanced market access and reduced post-harvest losses for tribal producers.
(d)  Improved all-weather road connectivity in tribal villages.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The TMMCs are explicitly designed to improve market access for tribal producers, enabling them to obtain better prices for their produce and minimizing post-harvest losses. This directly addresses a critical aspect of their socio-economic empowerment.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent important aspects of development but are not the direct and primary benefit of establishing TMMCs. The TMMCs aim to create a more equitable market system for tribal producers, thereby contributing to their overall economic well-being and reducing their vulnerability.  The mention of "right price" and minimizing "post-harvest losses" clearly points to the core functionality of the TMMCs.


**5.  A nationwide initiative focuses on ensuring that every child, by the end of Grade 3, achieves foundational literacy and numeracy skills.  This initiative's primary aim is best described as:**

(a)  Universalization of access to quality higher education.
(b)  Achieving universal foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) among children aged 3-9.
(c)  Improving the quality of teacher training programs.
(d)  Promoting digital literacy among school children.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description clearly outlines the goal of achieving universal foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) among children aged 3-9. This aligns directly with the objectives of the NIPUN Bharat Mission. Options (a), (c), and (d), while relevant to education, are not the primary focus of this specific initiative.  The emphasis on Grade 3 competency and the age range (3-9 years) underscores the program's concentrated effort on establishing foundational skills. The mission's explicit focus on reading, writing, and numeracy skills confirms the accuracy of option (b).


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  A global initiative aimed at standardizing anti-doping regulations and promoting a level playing field in sports, adopted in Paris in 2005, is associated with which international organization?**

(a)  World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)
(b)  International Olympic Committee (IOC)
(c)  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
(d)  World Health Organization (WHO)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport.  WADA is a crucial player in anti-doping efforts, but it didn't create the convention. The IOC also plays a significant role, but the convention itself is a UNESCO initiative.  The WHO focuses on broader public health; this convention is specifically about doping in sports. Therefore, (c) is the accurate answer. The convention's aim to harmonize anti-doping regulations globally is a key element of its significance for international sports governance.  It reflects the international community's commitment to fair play and the integrity of sporting competitions.  Understanding the roles of different international organizations in global governance is crucial for UPSC preparation.


**2.  The Asmita Project, launched by the Union Ministry of Education in India, is primarily focused on which of the following objectives?**

(a)  Developing advanced multilingual translation software.
(b)  Creating a national database of Indian languages and dialects.
(c)  Improving the quality and accessibility of educational materials in Indian languages.
(d)  Establishing new schools and colleges in underserved rural areas.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Asmita Project's core goal is to enhance the availability of high-quality educational resources in various Indian languages. While it indirectly relates to technology through translation, its primary objective isn't software development (a).  (b) describes a different initiative, a multilingual dictionary. (d) is a separate developmental goal unrelated to Asmita.  The project directly addresses the need for multilingualism in education, aligning with the New Education Policy 2020. Its impact on improving access to education for students from diverse linguistic backgrounds is a key aspect of its significance. The involvement of UGC and BBS highlights the government's commitment to supporting educational initiatives through collaborative efforts.


**3.  Which of the following initiatives is directly linked to providing dedicated support and services to Indian Defence pensioners, veterans, and their families through Common Service Centres (CSCs)?**

(a)  Project SPARSH
(b)  Project NAMAN
(c)  Project Zorawar
(d)  Khelo India Scheme


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Project NAMAN is explicitly designed to leverage SPARSH-centric CSCs to deliver focused assistance to defense personnel and their families. Project SPARSH is the system utilized, but NAMAN is the overarching initiative. Project Zorawar concerns military tank development, and Khelo India focuses on sports development, making them irrelevant to the question.  The use of CSCs demonstrates a strategic approach to reach a geographically dispersed population efficiently.  Understanding the government's initiatives to support veterans and their families is a relevant topic for UPSC.


**4. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in India, launched in 2015, employs which of the following as its primary assessment parameters?**

(a)  Student enrollment numbers, faculty-student ratio, and campus infrastructure.
(b)  Research funding secured, number of publications, and international collaborations.
(c)  Teaching, learning resources, research, graduation outcomes, outreach, and perception.
(d)  Alumni network strength, industry partnerships, and placement records.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** NIRF's ranking methodology centers around a multi-faceted evaluation. While the other options include some relevant factors, they don't represent the complete set of NIRF's key parameters.  The inclusion of "perception" demonstrates an attempt to incorporate a qualitative assessment alongside quantitative data.  The framework's evolution, including the addition of new categories, indicates a commitment to improving the assessment of higher education institutions in India.  Understanding the criteria for evaluating educational institutions is essential for UPSC aspirants.


**5.  The 2022 World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) testing figures revealed which country had the highest percentage of doping offenders?**

(a)  China
(b)  Russia
(c)  United States
(d)  India


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The passage explicitly states that India recorded the highest percentage (3.26%) of doping offenders in 2022 according to WADA data.  This highlights the importance of robust anti-doping measures in India and the challenges in maintaining the integrity of sports. The high percentage underscores the need for improved education and stricter enforcement of anti-doping rules.  Knowledge of global anti-doping trends and India's performance in this area is relevant for UPSC.


**6.  Which of the following is the primary aim of the  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023?**

(a) To restrict the entry of foreign universities to protect domestic institutions.
(b) To facilitate the entry of top-ranked foreign universities to enhance higher education in India.
(c) To establish a uniform curriculum for all universities, both domestic and foreign.
(d) To promote collaborations between Indian and foreign universities for joint research projects.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The regulations explicitly aim to enable the establishment of campuses by high-ranking foreign universities in India.  This aligns with the National Education Policy 2020's vision of internationalizing Indian higher education.  (a) is the opposite of the regulation's intent. (c) is not the central focus; the regulations allow for diverse curricula.  (d) is a related but secondary outcome; the primary aim is to bring in top foreign institutions.  The regulations reflect a strategic approach to improve the quality and global competitiveness of Indian higher education.


**7.  The draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024 in India emphasizes which of the following as one of its five pillars?**

(a)  Prioritizing elite athletes and neglecting grassroots development.
(b)  Focusing solely on Olympic sports and ignoring other disciplines.
(c)  Promoting sports for holistic national development, encompassing economic and social dimensions.
(d)  Restricting private sector involvement in sports management and infrastructure.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NSP 2024's vision explicitly includes "Sports for Nation Building" with a holistic approach.  (a) and (b) are contrary to the policy's inclusive vision. (d) would likely hinder private sector investment in sports infrastructure. The policy's emphasis on the multiple dimensions of sports' impact on society highlights its comprehensive approach to national development. This reflects the government's recognition of the potential of sports beyond just competition.


**8.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) in India has launched which initiative to pair universities with less-developed research capabilities with established institutions for mentorship?**

(a)  Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(b)  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)
(c)  Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(d)  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** PAIR is specifically designed for mentorship and capacity building in research. MAHA focuses on high-impact research areas. ACE establishes research centers. NETF is about technology in education.  PAIR's hub-and-spoke model aims to accelerate research development in universities with less experience, improving the overall research landscape in India.  The initiative demonstrates a strategic approach to fostering research capacity across the country.


**9. Which international convention, adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities?**

(a)  The Biwako Millennium Framework
(b)  The Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region
(c)  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)
(d)  The World Health Organization's Disability Action Plan


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN-CRPD is the specific international treaty addressing the rights of persons with disabilities.  The other options mention related documents or frameworks, but the UN-CRPD is the comprehensive international legal instrument.  India's ratification of the convention demonstrates its commitment to upholding the rights of persons with disabilities.  Understanding international human rights conventions is important for UPSC.


**10.  The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) in India is primarily focused on improving the socio-economic conditions of which specific group?**

(a)  Rural farmers
(b)  Urban slum dwellers
(c)  Tribal communities
(d)  Migrant workers


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  PM-JUGA explicitly targets tribal communities.  The name itself, referencing Birsa Munda, indicates its focus on tribal welfare.  The scheme aims to address social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood gaps within tribal communities.  The program highlights the government's commitment to addressing the specific needs of marginalized groups.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a detailed understanding of the material.


**1.  A national curriculum for early childhood care and education (ECCE) for children aged three to six was recently launched.  Which of the following statements accurately reflects a key feature of this curriculum?**

(a) It is a 24-week program focusing primarily on literacy and numeracy skills.
(b)  It emphasizes rote learning methods to ensure foundational knowledge.
(c) It incorporates an age-appropriate screening tool to facilitate the inclusion of children with disabilities.
(d) It is exclusively implemented in urban anganwadi centers.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Aadharshila curriculum, as described in the target content, explicitly includes an age-appropriate screening tool to aid in the inclusion of children with disabilities.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because the curriculum is a 48-week program and it emphasizes play-based learning, not rote learning. Option (d) is incorrect because the curriculum is designed for implementation across various settings, including anganwadis in both urban and rural areas.  The focus on inclusivity reflects a modern approach to early childhood education, aligning with international best practices and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of inclusive education policies and their practical implementation.


**2. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) has launched several key initiatives. Which of the following is NOT among the initiatives announced by the ANRF?**

(a)  Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(b) Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(c) National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) integration
(d) ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The ANRF's initiatives, as detailed in the text, include PAIR, MAHA, and ACE. The NIRF, while mentioned in another section of the provided text, is a separate entity and not an initiative *launched* by the ANRF.  The NIRF is a ranking framework, whereas the ANRF's focus is on fostering research and innovation.  Understanding the distinct roles of these organizations is crucial for a complete understanding of India's higher education and research landscape.  The question tests the ability to distinguish between related but separate entities in the Indian higher education system.


**3.  Recent amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, were agreed upon at a significant international meeting.  Which of the following is NOT a key amendment adopted?**

(a)  A clearer definition of a pandemic emergency, including its geographical spread and impact on national health systems.
(b) The establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism to support developing countries.
(c)  The mandate for all countries to adopt a uniform national health policy.
(d) The creation of National IHR Authorities to improve coordination among countries.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The amendments to the IHR, as described, include a refined definition of pandemic emergencies, a new financial mechanism, and the creation of national authorities.  Option (c) is incorrect. While the amendments aim to improve coordination, they do not mandate a uniform national health policy across all countries.  The IHR framework respects national sovereignty while promoting collaboration.  Recognizing this distinction highlights an understanding of international health governance and the balance between global cooperation and national autonomy.


**4.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. Which of the following is NOT a stated goal of this Abhiyan?**

(a) Providing pucca houses for eligible households with access to essential services.
(b) Promoting skill development, entrepreneurship, and enhanced livelihoods.
(c) Establishing a national-level sports training program for tribal youth.
(d) Increasing the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for tribal students to national levels.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The PM-JUGA's goals, as outlined, focus on housing, infrastructure, skill development, and education.  A national-level sports training program is not explicitly mentioned as a goal of this specific Abhiyan.  While sports and physical activity might be indirectly supported through broader development initiatives, it’s not a central objective of PM-JUGA. This question tests the ability to differentiate between the specific aims of a government program and broader national policies.


**5.  A recent initiative aims to promote multilingualism in education in India.  Which of the following is NOT one of the initiatives launched under this program?**

The establishment of a national language academy is not among the initiatives listed.  While standardization might be a long-term goal, it is not a specific initiative described within the provided context.  This question assesses the ability to accurately recall and differentiate between specific projects related to a larger policy goal.


**6.  The draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024, outlines key pillars for the development of sports in India.  Which of the following is NOT one of the five pillars of the draft NSP 2024?**

(a) Excellence on the global stage.
(b) Sports for economic development.
(c) Sports for social development and inclusion.
(d)  Establishment of a national sports university system.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The five pillars of the draft NSP 2024, as described in the target content, are excellence on the global stage, sports for economic development, sports for social development, sports as a people’s movement, and harmonization with NEP 2020. The establishment of a national sports university system, while a potentially beneficial policy, is not explicitly listed as one of the five main pillars of the draft policy. This question tests the ability to accurately identify the key elements of a comprehensive policy document.

The other options are not the primary purpose of RPL.  This showcases an understanding of alternative learning pathways and their integration into formal education systems.


**9.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) recently held a significant session. What was the main theme of the 17th session of the Conference of State Parties to the UN-CRPD?**

(a)  Promoting universal basic income for persons with disabilities.
(b)  Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future.
(c)  Developing standardized assistive technologies for persons with disabilities.
(d)  Establishing quotas for employment of persons with disabilities in the private sector.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the main theme of the 17th session was "Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future".  The other options are not the stated theme of this specific session.  This tests recall of specific details from the text and understanding of global disability rights.


**10.  Which of the following is NOT a component of the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)?**

(a)  Ensuring pucca houses with access to water and electricity.
(b)  Improving village infrastructure, including road connectivity and internet access.
(c)  Implementing a nationwide program to eradicate caste-based discrimination.
(d)  Increasing the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for tribal students.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** While PM-JUGA aims for overall development, the eradication of caste-based discrimination isn't a specific component of the Abhiyan's stated objectives. The other options are directly mentioned as goals within the PM-JUGA framework.  This question tests the ability to discern what falls within the scope of a particular government program.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the subject matter.


**1.  A significant development in higher education saw the issuance of a Letter of Intent (LoI) to a UK university for establishing a campus in Gurugram. Which regulatory framework governs this initiative and what is its primary objective?**

(a) The National Education Policy 2020, aiming to enhance international collaborations in research.
(b) The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, aiming to provide an international dimension to higher education.
(c) The Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), aiming to streamline foreign investment in the education sector.
(d) The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), aiming to improve the global ranking of Indian institutions.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the passage explicitly states that the LoI to the University of Southampton is issued under the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023.  The primary objective of these regulations, as mentioned in the text, is to facilitate the entry of high-ranked foreign universities into India and to provide an international dimension to higher education in the country.  This aligns directly with the National Education Policy 2020's vision, but the regulations themselves are the specific legal framework governing this action.  Option (a) is incorrect because, while the NEP 2020 envisions such collaborations, it's the UGC regulations that provide the mechanism. Option (c) is irrelevant as FEMA deals with foreign exchange, not specifically the establishment of foreign university campuses. Option (d) is also incorrect as NIRF focuses on ranking institutions, not facilitating their establishment.  The question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of the regulatory landscape of higher education in India.


**2. The 77th World Health Assembly (WHA) concluded with amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005.  Which of the following is NOT a key amendment adopted?**

(a)  A revised definition of a pandemic emergency, incorporating "wide geographical spread" and exceeding national health system capacity.
(b) The establishment of a States Parties Committee to enhance IHR implementation.
(c) The creation of a centralized global health fund to finance pandemic preparedness exclusively.
(d) The establishment of a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to assist developing countries.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). While the amendments did focus on strengthening financial mechanisms for pandemic preparedness, especially for developing nations (option (d)), they did *not* create a single, centralized global health fund. The amendments aimed for improved coordination and resource allocation, but not a unified funding body solely dedicated to pandemics.  Options (a) and (b) are accurately reflected in the passage as key amendments. The question assesses factual recall of specific details from the text and requires careful analysis of the nuances in the described amendments.  It tests the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding concepts.


**3.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) launched several key initiatives. Which of the following is NOT among the initiatives announced by the Prime Minister at the first Governing Board meeting?**

(d)  ANRF Centres of Excellence (ACE), aimed at establishing world-class research facilities.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). While NIRF is a separate ranking framework, the passage does not mention its integration with ANRF funding. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all explicitly mentioned as key initiatives launched under ANRF.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between different national research and ranking initiatives in India.  It requires careful reading and understanding of the individual programs launched by ANRF.


**4.  India's ranking in the 2022 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report, compared to its 2021 ranking, reveals what change?**

(a)  An improvement of 14 places.
(b)  A worsening of 14 places.
(c)  A worsening of 12 places.
(d)  An improvement of 12 places.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage states that India's ranking improved from 122nd in 2021 to 108th in 2022. This represents an improvement of 14 places (122 - 108 = 14). Therefore, option (a) is correct.  The question tests factual recall of numerical data and the ability to correctly interpret the information provided.  The close proximity of options (a) and (c) creates a difficult distractor for those who may not recall the exact figures precisely.


**5.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Which of the following is NOT a key feature or initiative under PM-JUGA?**

(a)  Focus on saturating critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, and education.
(b)  Establishment of Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs) to improve market access for tribal producers.
(c)  Exclusive focus on providing direct cash transfers to tribal households.
(d)  Promotion of tribal homestays to leverage tourism potential.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). While PM-JUGA aims to improve livelihoods, the passage doesn't mention direct cash transfers as a primary focus. The scheme emphasizes convergence of existing schemes and infrastructure development. Options (a), (b), and (d) are all explicitly mentioned as key features or initiatives within the PM-JUGA program.  This question tests comprehension and the ability to identify the core elements of a governmental scheme.  The inclusion of option (c) as a plausible but incorrect distractor, makes this a challenging question.

(a)  A clearer definition of a pandemic emergency.
(b)  The establishment of a global health technology fund.
(c)  The creation of a States Parties Committee for better implementation.
(d)  The establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism for developing countries.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the IHR, 2005, focused on improving international cooperation and preparedness for public health emergencies.  They included a refined definition of pandemic emergencies, mechanisms for better coordination among nations (States Parties Committee), and financial support for developing countries.  However, the creation of a dedicated global health technology fund is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.  The question tests the ability to identify factual details within a complex policy document and evaluate the accuracy of statements.


**4.  Which of the following is a key characteristic of the  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023?**

(a)  It mandates that all foreign universities must offer courses in Hindi.
(b)  It restricts the number of foreign university campuses to five.
(c)  It allows foreign universities to award their own degrees under their original name and seal.
(d)  It requires foreign universities to adopt the Indian education curriculum.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The regulations aim to facilitate the entry of high-ranking foreign universities into India.  A key feature is that these universities can award degrees using their own name and seal from their home country, maintaining their academic standards and recognition.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect; the regulations do not impose language restrictions, limit the number of campuses, or require adoption of the Indian curriculum. The question assesses understanding of a specific regulatory framework.


**5.  The Global Gender Gap Report 2024, published by the World Economic Forum, uses how many indicators to assess gender parity?**

(a) 10
(b) 12
(c) 14
(d) 16

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) employs 14 indicators across four key dimensions to measure gender parity.  This comprehensive assessment allows for a nuanced understanding of gender inequality across various aspects of life.  The other options (10, 12, and 16) are incorrect. The question tests factual recall of a specific report and its methodology.


**6.  The Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others Supreme Court case primarily addressed which issue?**

(a) The rights of indigenous communities to forest resources.
(b) Caste-based discrimination within prisons.
(c) Gender inequality in the judiciary.
(d) The protection of nomadic tribes' traditional livelihoods.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court case highlighted persistent caste-based discrimination in prisons, specifically targeting Denotified Tribes (DNTs) and "habitual offenders."  The ruling struck down discriminatory practices as unconstitutional, emphasizing the importance of equality within the prison system.  While options (a), (c), and (d) relate to important social justice issues, they are not the central focus of this particular case. The question tests knowledge of a significant legal case and its implications.


**7. The  National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates provide which type of information?**

(a)  Data on the number of doctors and nurses in each state.
(b)  Information on the financial flows within India's health system.
(c)  Details about the prevalence of various diseases across the country.
(d)  Analysis of the effectiveness of different health interventions.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NHA estimates offer a comprehensive overview of the financial aspects of India's health system, including funding sources, expenditure patterns, and utilization of healthcare services.  Options (a), (c), and (d), while relevant to healthcare, do not reflect the specific focus of the NHA, which is primarily financial accounting within the health sector. The question assesses conceptual understanding of a specific data source and its application.


**8.  The  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006,  provides which type of rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  Rights to free education and healthcare.
(b)  Rights to participate in government decision-making.
(c)  Habitat rights.
(d)  Rights to ownership of all forest produce.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FRA, 2006, specifically grants habitat rights to PVTGs under Section 3(1)(e).  This acknowledges their historical connection to forest lands and their right to continue residing in their traditional habitats.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are not incorrect in themselves; however, they are not the specific right provided under the cited section of the FRA.  The question tests the ability to link a specific legal provision to its intended beneficiaries and the nature of the rights granted.


**9.  Project NAMAN, launched by the Indian Army, primarily aims to support:**

(a)  The modernization of military equipment.

(b)  Tackling malnutrition through public-private partnerships.
(c)  Promoting sustainable agriculture practices.
(d)  Improving access to clean water and sanitation.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) is a Swiss-based NGO dedicated to reducing malnutrition globally.  It utilizes public-private partnerships to improve access to essential nutrients in diets.  While options (a), (c), and (d) are related to broader development goals, they do not accurately represent GAIN's core mission. The question tests factual recall of a specific organization and its objectives.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on diverse cognitive skills and difficulty levels.  Each question incorporates factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding, demanding precise knowledge.  The explanations are detailed, exceeding 100 words, and incorporate UPSC-relevant perspectives.


**1.  Which initiative aims to provide financial assistance to Self Help Groups (SHGs) in India, with a goal of creating a significant number of women entrepreneurs earning substantial annual incomes?**

(a)  PM-JUGA (Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan)
(b)  Lakhpati Didi Initiative
(c)  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)
(d)  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Lakhpati Didi Initiative, launched in 2023 under the Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), explicitly targets the creation of "Lakhpati Didis"—SHG members earning an annual household income of ₹1 lakh or more.  This initiative provides various forms of financial assistance, including capitalization support (Revolving Fund and Community Investment Fund), collateral-free bank loans, interest subvention, and access to the Women Enterprise Acceleration Fund.  Option (a), PM-JUGA, focuses on the socio-economic development of tribal communities. Option (c), GAIN, promotes nutrition investments in the agri-food sector. Option (d), NQAS, pertains to quality assurance in healthcare facilities.  Therefore, only the Lakhpati Didi Initiative directly addresses the empowerment of women entrepreneurs through SHGs and financial aid.


**2.  A government scheme aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood.  What is the name of this scheme, and what is a key feature of its implementation strategy?**

(a)  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, focusing on improved school infrastructure.
(b)  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme, using a micro-plan approach.
(c)  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), utilizing existing DAPST grants.
(d)  National Health Mission, emphasizing mobile medical units in remote areas.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is designed for the comprehensive socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities by converging various schemes and addressing infrastructural deficiencies. A key feature is its funding mechanism: it leverages existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.  Options (a), (b), and (d) represent individual schemes or program components, not a comprehensive initiative that addresses multiple aspects of tribal welfare in the way PM-JUGA does. The use of existing DAPST grants highlights a pragmatic approach to resource allocation, characteristic of PM-JUGA's implementation strategy.


**3.  Which legal framework grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India, and under which specific provision of this Act are these rights conferred?**

(c)  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, Section 3(1)(e)
(d)  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, Section 2(1)(d)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), provides the legal basis for habitat rights for PVTGs.  Specifically, Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA explicitly addresses habitat rights. The other options are incorrect; they pertain to different legal instruments focused on atrocity prevention, panchayat extension to scheduled areas, and human rights protection, respectively.  Understanding the specific provision within the FRA is crucial for comprehending the legal framework governing habitat rights for PVTGs.


**4.  Which international convention aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by persons with disabilities, and in what year did it enter into force?**

(a)  The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), 1981
(b)  The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), 1990
(c)  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), 2008
(d)  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), 1976


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is specifically designed to protect the rights of people with disabilities. It entered into force in 2008. The other options address women's rights, children's rights, and general civil and political rights, respectively, but not the specific rights of persons with disabilities.  Knowing the year the UN-CRPD entered into force demonstrates awareness of its implementation timeline and impact on international disability rights.


**5.  Which report tracks global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels, contributing to the achievement of specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?**

(a)  The Global Gender Gap Report
(b)  The Human Development Report
(c)  The Food Waste Index Report
(d)  The World Happiness Report


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Food Waste Index Report (FWI) directly addresses food waste at retail and consumer levels, supporting indicators within SDG 12.3.  The other reports focus on gender inequality, human development, and national happiness, respectively.  Understanding the specific role of the FWI in monitoring food waste and its contribution to SDG targets demonstrates a grasp of global sustainability indicators and their measurement.

The guidelines focus on the procedure for withdrawing life support, aligning with passive euthanasia.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  Each question is designed to be challenging, with plausible distractors and a detailed explanation.


**1.  A crucial initiative aimed at enhancing access to quality healthcare for Scheduled Tribes households, involving the use of mobile medical units in remote areas, is associated with which program?**

(a) Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana
(b) National Health Mission
(c) Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission
(d) Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The question refers to the use of Mobile Medical Units to extend healthcare access to Scheduled Tribes in areas where sub-centers are distant. This directly aligns with the National Health Mission's (NHM) objectives of improving healthcare access in underserved regions.  The other options are irrelevant; PMJDY focuses on financial inclusion, ABDM on digital health records, and PM-Kisan on farmer income support. The NHM specifically addresses the infrastructural challenges in providing healthcare, particularly in remote areas, making it the only appropriate answer.  Understanding the specific mandates of various government schemes is crucial for UPSC preparation, and this question tests that knowledge.


**2.  The "Tribal Home Stay" initiative, designed to leverage tourism potential for tribal communities, is a component of which larger program?**

(a)  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
(b)  Swadesh Darshan
(c)  Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission
(d)  National Rural Employment Guarantee Act


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the "Tribal Home Stay" initiative, aiming to promote tourism within tribal communities, operates under the Swadesh Darshan scheme of the Ministry of Tourism. The other options are incorrect. PMAY focuses on housing, DAY-NRLM on rural livelihoods, and NREGA on employment guarantee.  This question tests the ability to connect specific initiatives with broader government programs, highlighting the inter-linkages between different developmental schemes.  Knowledge of the various government schemes and their objectives is essential for effective UPSC preparation.


**3.  The establishment of "Centres of Competence (CoC)" to improve the diagnosis of a specific hereditary blood disorder is a key feature of which initiative?**

(a)  National Ayush Mission
(b)  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)
(c)  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi
(d)  National Mental Health Programme


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text mentions the establishment of CoCs in AIIMS and other institutions to advance the diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). This falls under the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), which focuses on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Sickle cell disease is prevalent in certain tribal populations; therefore, the initiative to improve diagnosis fits logically within the broader goals of PM-JUGA.  The other options are unrelated to SCD diagnosis. This question assesses the ability to link specific health interventions with larger developmental programs targeting vulnerable populations.



**4. The legal framework granting "habitat rights" to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) is primarily derived from which act?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996
(c) The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006
(d) The National Forest Policy, 1988


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage clearly states that habitat rights for PVTGs are granted under Section 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (also known as the Forest Rights Act or FRA).  This act specifically addresses the rights of forest-dwelling tribal communities, including their habitat rights.  The other options, while relevant to tribal welfare or forest management, do not directly grant habitat rights as defined in the context. This question tests the knowledge of specific legislation related to tribal rights and forest conservation.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly mentions that the GNAFC was launched in 2016 by the European Union, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Food Programme (WFP).  These three organizations are key players in addressing global food security issues.  The other options list organizations that are not directly involved in the GNAFC's founding. This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their roles in global governance and development.


**6. The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report, tracking global food waste at retail and consumer levels, is primarily a product of which organization?**

(a)  International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
(b)  World Health Organization (WHO)
(c)  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(d)  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The passage states that the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), in collaboration with WRAP, launched the Food Waste Index Report 2024.  UNEP's focus on environmental issues makes its involvement logical, given the environmental impact of food waste.  While FAO and IFAD are involved in food security, the primary custodian of the FWI is UNEP. This question assesses knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of various UN agencies.


**7.  The "Conservation cum Development (CCD)" plans are a key component of which scheme focused on Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  National Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation Scheme
(b)  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme
(c)  Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana
(d)  Eklavya Model Residential Schools Scheme


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly links the micro-plan approach using CCD plans to the "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" Scheme.  This scheme aims for the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs.  The other options are related to tribal welfare but do not directly involve the CCD planning approach. This question assesses the understanding of specific implementation strategies within a larger government program.


**8.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a)  Forest-based livelihoods
(b)  High literacy rates
(c)  Pre-agricultural level of existence
(d)  A stagnant or declining population


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage lists criteria for identifying PVTGs, which include forest-based livelihoods, a pre-agricultural level of existence, and a stagnant or declining population.  High literacy rates are not a characteristic of PVTGs; in fact, low literacy is often a defining feature. This question tests the ability to identify exceptions within a set of criteria.


**9. The recent amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, were primarily agreed upon at which forum?**

(a)  The United Nations General Assembly
(b)  The World Health Assembly (WHA)
(c)  The G20 Summit
(d)  The World Economic Forum


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the amendments to the IHR, 2005, were agreed upon at the 77th annual World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting.  The WHA is the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), making it the appropriate forum for such agreements.  The other options are not directly involved in the amendment process. This question tests knowledge of international health governance structures.


**10. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024, primarily aims to achieve which Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?**

(a) SDGs 3 and 4
(b) SDGs 5 and 6
(c) SDGs 1 and 2
(d) SDGs 7 and 8


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text clearly states that the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty aims to support efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty (SDGs 1 and 2) and reduce inequalities (SDG 10).  Therefore, the primary focus is on SDGs 1 and 2.  The other options do not align with the Alliance's stated objectives. This question assesses the ability to connect global initiatives with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals framework.


**1.  Which statement accurately reflects the definition of "habitat" as outlined in the Forest Rights Act (FRA)?**

(a)  It encompasses only the customary habitat of primitive tribal groups within protected forests.
(b)  It includes customary habitats and other habitats in reserved and protected forests for specified tribal groups.
(c)  It solely refers to the areas traditionally occupied by pre-agricultural communities.
(d)  It defines habitat as the area exclusively used for the traditional practices of forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the FRA's definition of "habitat" is explicitly broader than options (a), (c), and (d). It explicitly states that it includes both the customary habitat and *other* habitats within reserved and protected forests used by primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes (STs).  Options (a), (c), and (d) present a narrower, incomplete view of the FRA's definition, omitting crucial elements like the inclusion of "other habitats" and the consideration of various groups beyond just primitive tribal groups. The FRA's inclusive definition aims to safeguard a wider range of areas essential for the survival and livelihood of these communities, reflecting a holistic approach to forest rights.


**2. Which of the following tribal groups is NOT mentioned in the provided text as having been granted habitat rights in Odisha?**

(a) Paudi Bhuyans
(b) Saora tribals
(c) Kandha tribals
(d) Chuktia Bhunjia

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly names Paudi Bhuyans, Saora tribals, and Chuktia Bhunjia as among the tribal groups granted habitat rights in Odisha.  While the Dongria Kondhs are mentioned, "Kandha tribals" is a broader term.  The text specifies "Dongria Kondhs", a subgroup within the larger Kandha community.  Therefore, the absence of the general term "Kandha tribals" from the list of groups explicitly mentioned makes (c) the correct answer.  The question tests the ability to identify precise details from a list of tribal groups.  The other options are all explicitly named in the provided text.


**3. According to the text, which state houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Madhya Pradesh
(b) Chhattisgarh
(c) Maharashtra
(d) Odisha

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage directly states that Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, the highest number among all states and Union Territories. While the text mentions PVTGs in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra, it explicitly highlights Odisha's position as having the highest concentration.  This is a straightforward factual recall question testing knowledge about the geographical distribution of PVTGs in India.  The other options, while containing PVTGs, do not hold the highest number as specified in the text.


**4.  Which of the following is NOT a criterion used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)?**

(a) Forest-based livelihoods
(b) Pre-agricultural level of existence
(c) High literacy rates
(d) A subsistence economy

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly lists "forest-based livelihoods," "pre-agricultural level of existence," and "a subsistence economy" as criteria for identifying PVTGs.  Conversely, it mentions "extremely low literacy" as a characteristic of PVTGs.  Therefore, "high literacy rates" directly contradicts the established criteria and is the correct answer. This question assesses the ability to identify contrasting information and understand the characteristics defining PVTGs.  The other options are all explicitly stated as criteria in the provided text.


**5. The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme primarily aims to achieve which of the following?**

(a) Rapid assimilation of PVTGs into mainstream society.
(b)  Promote PVTG migration to urban areas for better opportunities.
(c) Comprehensive socio-economic development while preserving their culture and heritage.
(d)  Focus solely on improving agricultural practices among PVTGs.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The scheme's objective is clearly stated as encompassing comprehensive socio-economic development *while* retaining the cultural and heritage aspects of PVTGs.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either contradict or incompletely represent the scheme's goals. Option (a) suggests forced assimilation, which is not the scheme's intent. Option (b) promotes migration, ignoring the scheme's focus on improving conditions in their existing habitats. Option (d) limits the scope of development to only agriculture, neglecting other crucial elements like education and infrastructure.  This question tests the understanding of the scheme's overall objectives and its nuanced approach to development.


**6. Which of the following is NOT a component of the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)?**

(a) Improving infrastructure in government residential schools and hostels.
(b) Establishing Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs).
(c)  Promoting large-scale industrialization in tribal regions.
(d)  Providing access to training through the Skill India Mission.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text details several components of PM-JUGA, including infrastructure improvements in schools, TMMCs, and skill development through Skill India.  Option (c), promoting large-scale industrialization, is not mentioned as a component of the Abhiyan.  In fact, the Abhiyan's focus is on sustainable and inclusive development, which might be negatively impacted by large-scale industrialization without careful planning and consideration of potential environmental and social consequences.  This question tests the ability to distinguish between initiatives explicitly mentioned within the scheme and those that are not.


**7.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) aims to primarily achieve which of the following?**

(a)  Restrict research funding to established universities only.
(b)  Seed, grow, and foster a culture of research and innovation across India.
(c)  Focus solely on fundamental research in theoretical physics.
(d)  Centralize all research activities under a single government body.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ANRF's goal, as explicitly stated in the provided text, is to cultivate a research and innovation culture nationwide.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are inaccurate as they either limit the scope of ANRF's activities or present an unrealistic and potentially undesirable centralized approach to research.  Option (a) would exclude potential innovative research from emerging institutions. Option (c) severely restricts the research areas, whereas ANRF has broader goals. Option (d) would stifle academic freedom and competition.  This question assesses the understanding of the ANRF's overarching mission and its approach to promoting research.


**8.  Which of the following is NOT a key initiative announced under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)?**

(a) Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR)
(b) Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
(c) National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
(d) ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text lists PAIR, MAHA, and ACE as key ANRF initiatives.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is a separate initiative under the Ministry of Education, even though it might indirectly support research activities.  Therefore, NIRF is not a key initiative *directly* under the ANRF. This question tests the ability to differentiate between related but distinct initiatives within the Indian research landscape.


**9. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 report indicates which of the following about India’s ranking?**

(a) India's ranking improved significantly, moving from the "serious" to the "moderate" category.
(b) India's ranking remained unchanged compared to the previous year.
(c) India's ranking improved slightly, but still falls under the "serious" category.
(d) India's ranking worsened compared to the previous year, falling into the "alarming" category.


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that India's GHI ranking improved from 111th to 105th, but it remains in the "serious" category.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the direction and magnitude of the change in India's ranking. This question tests the ability to extract precise numerical and categorical information from the provided text and understand its implications.


**10.  Which organization(s) is/are responsible for publishing the Global Hunger Index (GHI)?**

(a) The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(b) Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
(c) The United Nations Development Programme
(d) The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly identifies Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe as the organizations responsible for publishing the GHI.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they do not publish the GHI. This is a straightforward factual recall question testing knowledge about the authorship of the GHI report.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be difficult, requiring in-depth knowledge and careful analysis.


**1.  A government initiative aims to comprehensively develop Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) while preserving their cultural heritage.  This scheme utilizes a micro-plan approach involving the creation of specific development plans.  Which of the following best describes this initiative?**

(a)  The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" Scheme, employing Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans.
(b)  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), focusing on infrastructure improvements.
(c)  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), granting habitat rights.
(d)  The Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), promoting Self-Help Groups (SHGs).


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The question directly describes the "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" Scheme.  The description highlights its core objective: comprehensive socio-economic development while safeguarding cultural heritage. The use of a micro-plan approach, specifically mentioning Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans, further solidifies the identification of this scheme.

Option (b), PM-JUGA, focuses on broader socio-economic improvements for tribal communities but doesn't explicitly detail the preservation of cultural heritage or the specific CCD plan methodology. Option (c), the FRA, is concerned with habitat rights, a different aspect of tribal welfare. Option (d), DAY-NRLM, promotes SHGs, a significant initiative but not directly related to the described comprehensive PVTG development program.


**2.  The Food Waste Index Report (FWI) tracks food waste at specific levels of the supply chain. One of its goals aligns with a specific Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator focusing on reducing per capita food waste at a particular stage. Which SDG indicator and associated UN agency is directly related to the FWI's primary objective?**

(a) SDG 12.3.1 (a), Food Loss Index (FLI); Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
(b) SDG 12.3.1 (b), FWI; UN Environment Programme (UNEP)

(b)  World Food Programme (WFP)
(c)  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
(d)  Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report, which tracks global and national food waste at retail and consumer levels, directly supports SDG 12.3.1 (b).  The question specifically asks about the custodian of this *specific* indicator, which is the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).  The FAO is involved in SDG 12.3 but focuses on a different aspect (food loss along the production and supply chains).  The WFP primarily focuses on food aid and assistance, while WRAP collaborates with UNEP on the FWI report but isn't the primary custodian.

(d)  World Economic Forum (WEF)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The passage explicitly states that the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN).  While the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) launches the report, the question specifically asks for the producing network.  The other options are incorrect because they are involved in different aspects of global hunger and food security, but not directly responsible for the annual production of the GRFC.  The UNDP focuses on broader development issues, the WEF focuses on global economic issues, and the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty has a broader scope than the production of a specific annual report. This question highlights the importance of understanding the specific roles and responsibilities of various organizations within the international food security landscape.

This report, released by five UN agencies (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO), specifically addresses the financing necessary to achieve food security and eradicate malnutrition.  The other options are incorrect because they focus on different aspects of global challenges.  The Food Waste Index Report deals with food waste, the Global Gender Gap Report with gender inequality, and the Global Hunger Index with hunger levels.  Understanding the distinctions between these reports is crucial for comprehending the breadth and complexity of global development issues and the specific focus of each report.


**5.  An Indian government initiative aims to provide instant food licenses and registrations through a pan-India IT platform. What is the name of this initiative?**

(a)  NQAS Assessment
(b)  Spot Food License Initiative

(b) FAO
(c) WFP
(d) WRAP

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** SDG 12.3.1 (a) specifically targets the reduction of food losses along production and supply chains.  The passage clearly states that the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of this indicator. UNEP is responsible for the consumer level food waste indicator.  WFP and WRAP, while involved in food security and waste reduction efforts, are not the custodians of this particular SDG indicator.  This question highlights the importance of understanding the specific roles and responsibilities of different organizations within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals.  Knowing which organization is responsible for each indicator demonstrates a thorough understanding of international cooperation in tackling global challenges.

(c)  The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
(d)  The entity that released the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d). The question directly refers to a report defining financing for food security and nutrition and detailing its global impact.  While the FAO (b) and GNAFC (c) are involved in food security issues, the question specifically points to the report's release and its novel definition of financing. The WHO (a) is primarily concerned with health, not directly with the scope of the described report.  The question highlights the report's central theme and its new definition, which is the core focus of the "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024," therefore making (d) the only appropriate response.


**4.  A significant international initiative aims to enable instant cross-border retail payments by connecting domestic Fast Payments Systems (FPS).  Which central bank recently joined this multilateral project, thereby linking its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with FPSs in other countries?**

(a) The People's Bank of China
(b) The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
(c) The European Central Bank (ECB)
(d) The Bank of Japan


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) The Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The question describes the key features of Project Nexus, a multilateral initiative focusing on instant cross-border payments.  The RBI's recent participation in this project, specifically linking the Indian UPI with other systems, makes it the only correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) represent other significant central banks, but the question clearly points to the RBI's involvement in Project Nexus and its direct connection to the UPI, making it the only suitable choice. The detail on interlinking UPI with other FPSs is crucial for identifying the correct answer.


**5.  Under which Act are habitat rights granted to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India, encompassing customary habitats and other areas within reserved and protected forests?**

(a) The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
(b) The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996
(c) The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA)
(d) The National Forest Policy, 1988


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA).  The question explicitly mentions habitat rights for PVTGs within reserved and protected forests.  The FRA specifically addresses these rights, as outlined in Section 3(1)(e). Options (a), (b), and (d) deal with other aspects of tribal welfare or forest management but do not directly address the specific legal framework for habitat rights as described in the question. The FRA's definition of "habitat" and the process of granting these rights are central to understanding the legal basis for PVTG land rights, making it the only appropriate answer.
